/**
 * The structural twin of `property-value-serialization.test.ts`, filed as part
 * of github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2765.
 *
 * `StoreEditor.addPropertySet`'s TEXT/LABEL map is pinned by that file, written
 * after the map got a member wrong. `addQuantitySet`'s kind map is the same
 * shape of table one method down and nothing pinned it: swapping
 * `AREA: QuantityType.Volume, VOLUME: QuantityType.Area` left 251 tests green
 * across `mutations`, `create` and `export`.
 *
 * It stayed invisible because every existing caller asserts the numeric VALUE
 * and never the entity token that declares what the number MEANS. `12.5` is
 * `12.5` whether it is written as `IFCQUANTITYAREA` or `IFCQUANTITYVOLUME`, so
 * a miswiring would have exported every area as a volume with no test
 * disagreeing anywhere. The token is the discriminating output, so the whole
 * table is asserted here, from the authoring API through to the file.
