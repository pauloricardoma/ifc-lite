/**
 * The source-iteration phase of `StepExporter.export()` (#2475 step 2d): the
 * pass that writes one line per record the SOURCE file already holds, plus the
 * shared-atom retention that has to run before it decides what to skip.
 *
 * This phase reads more of the export's shared state than any other — 16 of
 * {@link ExportPass}'s members — and it consumes what three earlier phases
 * wrote: `modifiedAttributes` and `inPlaceNominees.georeferencing` from the
 * georeferencing phase (`step-georeferencing.ts`), and `rewrittenEntityIds` /
 * `skipPropertySetIds` / `allowedEntityIds` from the collection and setup
 * phases. It writes `pass.entities`, which `assembleStepBytes` turns into
 * bytes at the end of `export()`, and `pass.modifications`, which `settle()`
 * reads. Nothing pulls the other way, which is why it moves last.
 *
 * What is injected rather than moved, and why: the
 * `applySourceLineMutations` pipeline (and its `applyAttributeMutations` /
 * `applyPositionalMutations` — free functions in `step-attribute-
 * mutations.ts`, with the two per-slot serialize helpers they share with the
 * overlay-created path in `step-attribute-serializers.ts` — #2475's
 * "remaining private helpers" step, split further by #3184) is shared
 * verbatim with the type-object `HasPropertySets` rewrite in
 * `step-property-sets.ts` and with `step-overlay-entities.ts`, so it belongs
 * to no single phase; `isGeometryEntity` is likewise read by the setup
 * closure and by that module. `applyOverlayEntityOverrides` is NOT a
 * dependency of this phase at all — it is reached only from
 * `step-overlay-entities.ts` — and is injected there instead, though it too
 * now lives in its own file, `step-overlay-attribute-overrides.ts`.
 *
 * Unlike `step-georeferencing.ts` this phase needs no `allocateExpressId`
 * callback: it never allocates an id, it only rewrites lines that already have
 * one.
 *
 * No test file travelled with this module, and that is a measured result, not
 * an omission. Disabling the loop at its call site kills 106 tests across 22
 * files — but that is the count of tests that need SOME source-backed line to
 * exist for their assertion to mean anything, not the count of tests of this
 * phase's logic (8 of them are in `step-georeferencing.test.ts`, a phase
 * already extracted). Mutating each of the phase's 27 individual sites instead
 * puts every narrow kill set in a file whose name already points at the code:
 * `shared-atom` for the retention pass, `source-ref-bounds` for the unreadable
 * ref guard, `includegeometry-header-count` for the geometry skip,
 * `visible-only-dangling-refs` for the relationship-ref filter,
 * `rewritten-type-line-attributes` for the rewritten-entity skip,
 * `overlay-effective-model` for the effective-type classification and
 * `delta-modification-count` for the two ledger writes. Every test file in this
 * package lives in one flat directory, so those names need no move — and unlike
 * step 2b/2c, `step-exporter.test.ts` holds no test that dies to a NARROW site
 * here, only ones that die because the file would otherwise be empty.
