/**
 * Regression guard for the dangling-reference class of #2637 / #2398, reached
 * through the omission reason those fixes did not cover: an UNREADABLE SOURCE
 * REF (#2491).
 *
 * `willBeEmitted` in `step-exporter.ts` recognises seven reasons an entity's
 * line never lands in the file. The relationship-reference filter used to
 * consume a separate predicate that answered for only two of them (hidden
 * product, tombstoned). A record whose byte range this source
 * cannot address is skipped by the source-iteration pass — so no `#N=` line —
 * while an `IFCREL*` naming it was copied verbatim, on a PLAIN full export
 * with no `visibleOnly` and no deletions anywhere in the call.
 *
 * The fix makes both output-line filter sites consume `isOmittedFromOutput` —
 * the negation of `willBeEmitted`, narrowed to ids the model has or has
 * tombstoned, so that a ref already dangling in the INPUT file is not treated
 * as this export's omission (see that predicate's doc, and #2637).
 * What pins that wiring here is BEHAVIOURAL and nothing else:
 * every test below feeds an input on which the output predicate and the walk
 * predicate give different answers, and checks the bytes. Substituting the
 * walk predicate at either call site, or gutting `willBeEmitted` to
 * `return true`, turns them red.
 *
 * An earlier revision of this file also carried a source-text "drift guard"
 * that `readFileSync`'d `step-exporter.ts` and asserted on its text. It was
 * removed, not merely relocated: with `willBeEmitted`'s body replaced by
 * `return true` — the whole defect, restored — all four of its assertions
 * stayed green while the three behavioural tests below went red. It is also
 * the pattern `scripts/check-source-text-assertions.mjs` exists to stop.
