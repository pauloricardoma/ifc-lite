/**
 * Non-`IFCREL*` classes whose OWN attributes hold direct entity-reference
 * LISTS, so `step-source-iteration.ts` runs
 * `narrowNonRelPositionalRefLists` (`nonrel-positional-ref-narrowing.ts`) on their
 * source line — a narrow-only sibling of the `filterHiddenRefsFromRelationshipLine`
 * rule already run on every `IFCREL*` line and on `STYLE_RESCUE_TYPES`
 * (`style-closure.ts`). Deliberately the sibling, not the shared function:
 * these classes also carry bare, inherited single-valued refs (`IfcRoot
 * .OwnerHistory`, `IfcAppliedValue.UnitBasis`) that the shared function's
 * bare-ref rule would withhold the whole line for — correct for an
 * `IFCREL*` association, wrong for an entity's own record (see
 * `narrowNonRelPositionalRefLists`'s doc for the full argument).
 *
 * `step-omission-predicates.ts` documents the filter's reach as "Only
 * `IFCREL*` lines" and gives `Representation`/`ObjectPlacement` as the
 * general exempt case (80 dangling refs before and after on
 * `tests/models/AB22.ifc`) — that stays true for every type NOT in this set,
 * and a BARE ref stays exempt even for a type IN this set (narrowing reaches
 * lists only).
 *
 * DERIVED, not hand-kept (#5181). Two rounds of hand-enumeration
 * (`IfcCostItem.CostValues`/`.CostQuantities`, `IfcAppliedValue`/
 * `IfcCostValue.Components`, `IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity.HasQuantities` —
 * the original four; `IfcPropertySet.HasProperties` and
 * `IfcElementQuantity.Quantities` — #5181's own gap) each missed a case, so
 * this is now computed at module load from `@ifc-lite/parser`'s
 * codegen-generated schema registries rather than copied by hand from the
 * `.exp` files: every CONCRETE, non-`IFCREL*` entity — across all three
 * registries `@ifc-lite/parser` carries (IFC2X3/IFC4/IFC4X3), since a class
 * can declare an attribute in one schema version and not another (the doc
 * on `IfcCostItem` in `nonrel-positional-ref-narrowing.ts` is the checked
 * example: no `CostValues`/`CostQuantities` at all in IFC2X3) — that has at
 * least one attribute, own or inherited, which is a SET or LIST (`isSet ||
 * isList`) whose `type` names another entity in that same registry. That is
 * exactly the shape `narrowNonRelPositionalRefLists` exists for: a direct
 * LIST attribute on a non-relationship class that names other entities,
 * reached by a session deletion (`bim.store.removeEntity`,
 * `@ifc-lite/mutations`'s `store-editor.ts`) the same way an `IFCREL*`
 * line's list attributes are.
 *
 * `@ifc-lite/parser`'s runtime schema registries are already an existing
 * runtime dependency of this package (`declared-property-type.ts` imports
 * `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` directly, and `nonrel-positional-ref-narrowing.ts`
 * already calls `getSchemaRegistryForVersion` for all three versions at
 * narrowing time) — deriving this set from them adds no new dependency
 * surface, so there is no perf/layering reason to fall back to a hand-kept
 * set plus a drift test here.
 *
 * `narrowNonRelPositionalRefLists` is purely SYNTACTIC — it does not know or
 * care which attribute position means what, only whether an attribute is a
 * bare `#N` (left alone) or a parenthesised list of them (narrowed) — so a
 * type appearing in the derived set is the whole change needed to cover it:
 * no new per-type attribute-index table.
 *
 * LOWER BOUND, NOT JUST "IS AN AGGREGATE OF ENTITIES". A first pass at this
 * derivation checked only `isSet || isList` plus an entity `type` and
 * produced 270 types — every non-`IFCREL*` concrete class with ANY
 * entity-reference aggregate, including geometry shapes such as
 * `IfcPolyline.Points` (`SET [2:?]`) and `IfcPolyLoop.Polygon`
 * (`SET [3:?]`). `narrowNonRelPositionalRefLists`'s own doc states the
 * premise its "still non-empty: narrowing alone cannot violate a `[1:?]`
 * lower bound" branch depends on: a lower bound of exactly 1 (or 0). Those
 * two examples have a lower bound of 2 and 3 — deleting one member of a
 * two-point `IfcPolyline` would narrow a valid 2-point line to an INVALID
 * 1-point one, silently, which is a worse defect than the dangling ref this
 * file exists to remove. So the derivation below additionally requires
 * `arrayBounds[0] <= 1` of the attribute that QUALIFIES a type. That gate
 * is per type, but a qualifying type can still carry a second, higher-bound
 * aggregate on the same line (`IfcFillAreaStyleTiles.TilingPattern`,
 * `LIST [2:2]`, beside its qualifying `Tiles`), so
 * `narrowNonRelPositionalRefLists` also reads EACH slot's own declared
 * lower bound and leaves a slot untouched when narrowing would drop it below
 * that bound.
 *
 * ONE MORE EXCLUSION: every `IfcTypeObject` subtype (`IfcWallType`,
 * `IfcDoorStyle`, …) is skipped ENTIRELY, not just at its
 * `HasPropertySets` attribute. `HasPropertySets` — `SET [1:?] OF
 * IfcPropertySetDefinition` — already has a DEDICATED, tested owner:
 * `type-owned-psets.ts`'s `HAS_PROPERTY_SETS_SLOT` plus
 * `anonymize-scrub.ts`'s `keepPropertySets` option, which writes this exact
 * slot BEFORE `StepExporter` runs. `keepPropertySets: true`'s documented
 * contract is to preserve the ORIGINAL list verbatim, dangling ref and all
 * (`anonymize-scrub.test.ts`, "keeps the original HasPropertySets list").
 * A first version of this derivation tried excluding only the
 * `HasPropertySets` attribute by name — and still broke that contract,
 * because `IfcWallType` (through `IfcTypeProduct`) ALSO carries
 * `RepresentationMaps : SET [1:?] OF IfcRepresentationMap`, which
 * legitimately qualifies on its own. `narrowNonRelPositionalRefLists` reads
 * and rewrites a source line's slots as a whole (`readStepSlots` over every
 * parenthesised attribute), with no per-slot exemption mechanism — once a
 * line is in scope for ANY slot, EVERY slot on it is narrowed, including
 * `HasPropertySets`. So the only choice that actually keeps
 * `keepPropertySets`'s contract is to exclude the whole `IfcTypeObject`
 * family from this set, trading away narrowing's reach onto
 * `RepresentationMaps` (a pre-existing gap this change does not close,
 * not a regression) for correctness on the slot that already has an owner.
