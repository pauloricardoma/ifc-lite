 * cannot take the same fallback: IFCPROXY is an IfcProduct, not an

 *   compute that set in its own (offset, remapped) id space, so it omits
 *   this argument and keeps the unconditional throw — proving the omission
 *   is safe there is future work, not assumed.

/**
 * Non-rooted types whose OWN record — not merely a value referencing it —
 * is safe to OMIT from an IFC2X3 export instead of throwing (#4206).
 *
 * The default above (throw) exists because dropping an arbitrary non-rooted
 * line risks leaving some OTHER record's reference to it dangling, and this
 * function sees one line at a time — it has no way to know. Adding a type
 * here is only safe when EVERY legal reference to it is provably re-routed
 * through this same function too, so no surviving record can end up naming
 * an id this export omitted.
 *
 * `IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration` qualifies: the EXPRESS schema restricts
 * every legal reference to it to exactly one slot family —
 * `IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad` on the structural action/reaction
 * types — and `schema-converter.ts`'s `convertRecord` forces every one of
 * those through this same "no representation" resolution whenever its
 * `AppliedLoad` names a withheld id (`withheldRefIds`, computed once per
 * export from every `IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration` id the source store
 * holds — see `computeWithheldRefIds`). A rooted referrer becomes an
 * IFCPROXY the same way any other unrepresented rooted type does; nothing
 * survives the export still pointing at the omitted `IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration`.
 *
 * The `IFCMATERIALPROFILE*` family (#5115) qualifies the same way:
 * `IfcMaterialProfile`, `IfcMaterialProfileSet` (+ its `MaterialProfiles`
 * list back-reference), `IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage`,
 * `IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageTapering` (adds a second `ForProfileEndSet`
 * slot) and `IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets` are IFC4-only, non-rooted, and
 * every ordinary path to one of them is `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial
 * .RelatingMaterial` (the sole `IfcMaterialSelect`-typed attribute in the
 * schema) — `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial` is rooted, so it already gets the
 * IFCPROXY fallback regardless of this set. (A handful of generic,
 * multi-purpose non-rooted types could in principle also name one of these
 * ids — `IfcResourceObjectSelect` on `IfcExternalReferenceRelationship`/
 * `IfcResourceApprovalRelationship`/`IfcResourceConstraintRelationship`,
 * `IfcObjectReferenceSelect` on `IfcPropertyReferenceValue`, and
 * `IfcMaterialProperties.Material` (typed `IfcMaterialDefinition`, so it can
 * legally hold a profile/profile-set directly, not only a plain
 * `IfcMaterial`) — they are deliberately NOT added here, because
 * `computeWithheldRefIds` is type-scoped, not instance-scoped, and every one
 * of those types is used for many unrelated resources too (the fixture
 * itself has two `IfcMaterialProperties` on a plain `IfcMaterial`, which must
 * NOT be omitted), so adding them would omit every instance of that type
 * rather than only the ones that reference a withheld id. A real file
 * exercising one of those rare paths would still throw — a known,
 * documented residual, not a silent miss.)
 *
 * Do not add another type here without the same end-to-end guarantee: this
 * set is exactly as safe as the caller's `withheldRefIds` computation is
 * complete for it.
