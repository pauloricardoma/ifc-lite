 * scan; keeping the wrapper gives remapping an explicit refusal boundary
 * without retaining a fourth parser (LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#4125/#4200).
 *
 * The validated splitter preserves an empty trailing slot so malformed
 * fixed-arity records cannot shift positional meaning. It does NOT trim
 * whitespace around a token, whatever this comment used to say: measured,
 * `splitTopLevelStepArguments("'a' ,  $  , #3 ")` returns
 * `["'a' ", "  $  ", " #3 "]`, and no test pinned the trimming half.

/**
 * Renamed entity types whose attribute lists are safe to reconcile BY NAME
 * (`remapRenamedAttributesByName`) instead of leaving the line's attributes
 * untouched under the new type name.
 *
 * This is deliberately an allowlist, not "every rename that fails the
 * strict-prefix test": `convertStepLine`'s existing behaviour for a rename
 * whose lists aren't prefix-related is to leave the attributes alone
 * (`IFCBRIDGE` → `IFCBUILDING` is pinned exactly that way in
 * `schema-converter.test.ts`, since `IfcBuilding` predates the IFC4X3
 * facility types and the two attribute vocabularies mostly don't correspond
 * by name either — a by-name remap there would silently `$`-out most of an
 * `IfcBuilding` line). Only IFCDOORTYPE/IFCWINDOWTYPE → IFCDOORSTYLE/
 * IFCWINDOWSTYLE are added here: verified case by case (see the entry in
 * `IFC4_TO_IFC2X3` in `schema-converter.ts`) to share a genuine
 * IfcTypeProduct-derived attribute vocabulary with their IFC2X3 target,
 * where before this fix every door/window TYPE object fell through to
 * `resolveUnrepresentedEntity` and was replaced by an IFCPROXY with a
 * freshly minted GlobalId — losing the door/window's own identity, Name
 * and property-set associations even though IFC2X3 has a real (if
 * differently shaped) representation for it.
 *
 * `IFCSTRUCTURALCURVEACTION`/`IFCSTRUCTURALSURFACEACTION` are added for the
 * same reason (#4206): each shares `GlobalId` through `DestabilizingLoad`
 * with its IFC2X3 `IfcStructuralLinearAction`/`PlanarAction` target, but
 * IFC2X3 inserts an optional `CausedBy` before `ProjectedOrTrue` where IFC4
 * instead appends `PredefinedType`, so neither list is a positional prefix
 * of the other verified case by case (see the entries in `IFC4_TO_IFC2X3`
 * in `schema-converter.ts`).

/**
 * Reconcile a renamed entity's attribute list by matching attribute NAMES
 * between the source and target schema tables, rather than by position.
 *
 * Only called for `BY_NAME_ATTR_REMAP_TYPES` members whose lists fail the
 * strict-prefix test in `schema-converter.ts` — e.g. IfcDoorType(IFC4) →
 * IfcDoorStyle(IFC2X3): both start with the same eight IfcTypeProduct
 * attributes, but IFC4 inserted `ElementType`/`PredefinedType` before its
 * own `OperationType`/`ParameterTakesPrecedence`, so neither list is a
 * prefix of the other.
 *
 * A target attribute with no same-named source attribute becomes `$`
 * (unknown) rather than a guess; a source attribute with no same-named target
 * slot is dropped. Both are honest data loss for attributes the target
 * schema's OWN shape does not carry under that name — never a misplaced value.
 *
 * That `$` is not the last word on a slot IFC2X3 requires a value in.
 * `IfcDoorStyle`/`IfcWindowStyle` declare `OperationType`, `ConstructionType`,
 * `ParameterTakesPrecedence` and `Sizeable` mandatory, and
 * `IfcDoorType`/`IfcWindowType` have no `ConstructionType` or `Sizeable` at
 * all; `Ifc2x3SlotFill` settles all four from the generated required-slot
 * table straight after this runs — on every conversion to IFC2X3, fill
 * argument or not — because this output carries exactly the target's
 * attribute count. Same policy and shape as the Rust `remap_attrs_by_name`.
