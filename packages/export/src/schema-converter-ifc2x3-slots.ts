 * Slots IFC2X3 requires a value in, on a downgrade to IFC2X3 (#4714).
 *
 * IFC4 made attributes optional that IFC2X3 declares mandatory, so a valid
 * IFC4 record legitimately carries `$` where the IFC2X3 target requires a
 * value. Two policies settle those slots, and this is the one object an
 * exporter threads through {@link convertStepLine} to apply both:
 *
 * - `IfcRoot.OwnerHistory` is REUSED from an `IfcOwnerHistory` the export
 *   already writes ({@link OwnerHistoryFill}, #4686). Nothing is invented,
 *   because an owner history asserts who made the model, with which
 *   application, when.
 * - Every other required slot is read from the generated
 *   `IFC2X3_REQUIRED_SLOTS` table. An enum with a `NOTDEFINED` member takes
 *   `.NOTDEFINED.` and a BOOLEAN takes `.F.`, the values that claim nothing. A
 *   measure, label, identifier or entity reference has no such value, so the
 *   slot keeps `$` and is COUNTED: the caller learns the file is not valid
 *   IFC2X3 rather than receiving a fabricated dimension.
 *
 * One per export: the exporter settles the owner history before the first
 * record and reads {@link warnings} after the last.
 *
 * Twin of `rust/export/src/schema_ifc2x3_slots.rs`.
