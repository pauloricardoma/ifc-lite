/**
 * The REPORTING half of #4125, at the export's own surface.
 *
 * `by-index-writers-refuse.test.ts` pins that the writers refuse and that
 * `SourceLineMutations.unreadable` says so. That flag is internal: nothing there
 * fails if the export never turns it into something a caller can see. Deleting
 * the `unreadableRecordEditsDroppedWarning` push left the whole suite green,
 * which is the same "silent discard" shape #4125 is about, surviving inside the
 * change that prevents it. So each of the two passes that write a source entity
 * line gets a case here asserting the warning reaches `result.stats.warnings` —
 * the collection an exporter's caller actually reads.
 *
 * The last two cases are the other direction — what the report must NOT claim.
 * A record whose line the export withholds must not also be reported as written,
 * which is why the report is buffered rather than pushed where it is produced;
 * and a cross-schema export must abort before partially converting a record
 * whose positional slots were refused (#4200).

 * between them: quote parity stays even and paren depth returns to zero, so the
 * split produces parts that are not the record's slots. Every phantom below has
 * the same shape.
 *
 * `#10` (the wall) and `#20` (the containment relationship) carry one each;
