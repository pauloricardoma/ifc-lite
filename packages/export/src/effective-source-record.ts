 * AFTER the create applied on top. Extracted from `effectiveAppearanceRecord`
 * (#4857 PR A) so a reader that wants an overlay-created entity to read
 * exactly as the exported file will state it — the cost read model
 * (`CostMutationOverlay.created()`), so an authored `IfcCostItem` is visible
 * to `bim.cost` before the model is ever exported — goes through the same one
 * writer `effectiveAppearanceRecord` already used, rather than a second
 * re-implementation of retype + override layering.
 *
 * Returns `null` when `expressId` names no overlay-created entity (nothing to
 * report — the caller falls back to the source-record path). Throws when the
 * created entity's authored argument list does not scan for a pending retype:
 * the same condition `effectiveAppearanceRecord` throws on, since neither
 * caller can hand back a well-formed record. A `created()` caller in a read
 * model (as opposed to export, which must fail loudly) should catch this and
 * report a diagnostic instead of propagating it.
