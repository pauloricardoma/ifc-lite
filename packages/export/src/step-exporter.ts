     * type-owned passes below are built from unfiltered mutation history, and
     * what each of them needs to know before emitting an
     * `IFCRELDEFINESBYPROPERTIES` is not "was this deleted" or "is this hidden"
     * but the general question those are two answers to. A relation naming an
     * expressId that never gets written is a dangling reference and an invalid
     * file, whichever route dropped the line.
     *
     * #2030 had to reach for four things to answer it — a tombstone probe, a
     * visibility set, a byte-range test on `completeIndex`, and a `getNewEntity`
     * fallback whose stated purpose was that `deleteEntity` FORGOT an
     * overlay-created entity instead of tombstoning it, so `isDeleted` could not
     * answer for one. That fallback was documented on main as a workaround for
     * exactly the model-level defect this branch fixes: `deleteEntity` now
     * tombstones as well as forgets, so the effective index answers existence
     * for source and overlay ids alike and the workaround collapses into it.
     *
     * The overlay branch does NOT disappear with it, and the distinction matters:
     * `isOverlayCreated` is still load-bearing here, because a live
     * overlay-created entity has no source bytes and would fail the byte-range
     * test that a source record passes. What the tombstone fix removed is the
     * need for that branch to double as a deletion detector.
     *
     * Deliberately unchanged from #2030 for source records under `deltaOnly` /
     * `exportPropertiesOnly`: the source-iteration pass is skipped wholesale in
     * those modes, yet a source entity still answers true here. A delta is a
     * patch against a file that already has the line, not a standalone model.

   * REPLACES it (`rewrittenEntityIds` makes the source pass skip those ids).
   * The rewrite used to do its own thing (replace slot 5, nothing else), so

   * in silence: first the renames (#2462 follow-up), and after those were
   * special-cased here, still the retypes and the positional edits. Whatever
   * the source pass applies, the rewrite has to apply too, or the next edit
   * kind added to one site goes missing at the other.
   *
   * The order is load-bearing:
   *
   *   - the retype runs FIRST so named attribute edits resolve against the
   *     TARGET class's attribute names, and so positional slots are indexed
   *     into the retyped argument list;

   * All three flags report EFFECT, not intent — each is the answer to "did this
   * operation change the line", measured across that operation alone. The count
   * and the ledger are claims about the FILE, so an edit that resolves to the

   * an entity to the class it already is, or writing a positional slot the token
   * it already holds, used to count as a modification and reach the ledger as a
   * landed edit, over a byte-identical line. Discarded edits read the same way:
   * `applyAttributeMutations` drops a name its class has no slot for and
   * `retypeStepLine` returns an unparseable line untouched, and neither is a
   * modification of anything.
   *
   * `retyped` / `positional` matter most in a FULL export, which is where the
   * two are nominated (their edits have no earlier nomination site); named
   * attribute edits are nominated by the collection pass and `attributed` only
   * settles their delivery.

   * clamps the range it cannot address, and the clamped window is still a
   * window over real file bytes — so these readers answer from somebody
   * ELSE's record. `source-ref-bounds.ts` (#2491) carries the measured
   * account of both shapes and of why "a clamped, empty decode already yields
   * no match" is false; it is not restated here, because an argument kept in
   * two files is an argument that has to stay true in two files.
   *
   * The consequence specific to THIS site is that the wrong answer is acted
   * on. `retainSharedAtoms` un-skips every id `getPropertyIdsInSet` returns,
   * so a member list read out of the wrong record un-skips the wrong atoms;
   * and the source-iteration pass already refuses to emit a record whose ref
   * fails `isReadableSourceRef` (see the `continue` in `export`), so before
   * this gate these readers were making decisions on behalf of a container
   * that the same export had decided not to write. Gating them on the same
   * predicate is what makes the two passes agree.
   *
   * The degradation is the one the exporter already handles: a record with no
   * emittable bytes, generating nothing and named by nothing. It costs one
   * answer that used to be right by luck — an overrunning ref on the file's
   * LAST record clamps back to exactly that record's text — but that record
   * is one the emission pass drops anyway, so keeping the answer only kept
   * the disagreement.
