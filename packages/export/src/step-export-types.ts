/**
 * The vocabulary of a STEP export: what a caller asks for, what it gets back,
 * and the state one `export()` call threads through its phases.
 *
 * Split out of `step-exporter.ts` for #2475. These are declarations only -- no
 * behaviour lives here beyond one message builder -- which is why they could
 * move without touching a single guard.
 *
 * Two ways in, deliberately. The seven sibling modules that already imported
 * `ExportPass` / `SourceLineMutations` still import them from
 * `step-exporter.js`, which re-exports this file, so no existing call site
 * moved and the package's public entry point is untouched. Code written since
 * the split imports straight from here instead -- `step-pass-builder.ts` does
 * -- because the re-export exists to avoid churning callers, not as a channel
 * anything new should be routed through.

/**
 * The edits queued for a source record were dropped because its own argument

 * Said out loud, because the alternative was worse in both directions. Writing

 * attribute and deletes what was there, while reporting success; refusing
 * without saying so leaves an export that looks like it carried the edit. The
 * usual cause is an undoubled apostrophe inside a string-typed attribute, which
 * an authoring tool emits when it forgets to double one — two of those leave
 * quote parity even and paren depth at zero, so nothing structural notices
 * (#4125).
 *
 * It says what was DROPPED and nothing about what was written. It used to open
 * "was written exactly as the source file has it", which is a claim this
 * sentence is in no position to make: the pipeline that produces it runs before
 * `writeSourceEntityLines` hands the record to `convertStepLine`, and a
 * cross-schema export can rename the record's type, trim or pad its attribute
 * list, replace it with an `IFCPROXY`, or drop it from the output entirely. So
 * on exactly the path where a caller most needs to know what became of a
 * dropped edit, the diagnostic was false (#4213).
 *
 * Buffering the report until the line's fate is known — the treatment
 * `step-source-iteration.ts` already applies to the withholding branches — does
 * not fit here. The refusal is produced one layer below the two writers, and
 * the other of them (`step-property-sets.ts`'s type-object rewrite) never
 * converts at all, so a message about the output would have to be assembled
 * differently per caller for a fact neither caller is reporting. A sentence
 * about the refusal is true on every path, which is what a shared message needs
 * to be. It does not replace the dropped clause with a weaker one either — "the
 * record keeps the values the source gave it" is false on the same conversion
 * path, for the same reason.
 *
 * `type` is the class the SOURCE record carries, which is the class the dropped
 * edits were queued against; it is not a claim about the class the export
 * writes, which on that same conversion path can differ.

/**
 * The state one `export()` call shares across its seven phases.
 *
 * Introduced by step 1 of #2475: `export()` is ~1267 lines and the phases a
 * split would separate are held together by ~30 local bindings, most of which
 * are read in three or more phases. Naming that set once — as an interface
 * with a single construction site at the top of `export()` — is what lets a
 * later phase extraction take one parameter instead of fifteen.
 *
 * Two properties of this object are load-bearing and must survive every later
 * move:
 *
 * 1. **The predicates are members, not duplicated expressions.** Six of them
 *    (`isOverlayCreated`, `isReadableSourceRef`, `isGeometryExcluded`,
 *    `hasEmittableHostBytes`, `willBeEmitted`,
 *    `isRefExcludedDuringClosureWalk`) exist precisely so two phases cannot
 *    disagree about a gate — see the comments at their construction sites for
 *    the corrupt files the earlier, per-phase versions let through (#2491,
 *    #2414, #2398, #2637). A phase that reimplements one of these instead of
 *    reading it off the pass reintroduces exactly that class of defect.
 * 2. **`allowedEntityIds` and `hiddenProductIds` are mutable, and the
 *    predicates close over the pass rather than over a snapshot.** Both are
 *    assigned AFTER construction, in `step-collection.ts`, and the order there
 *    matters more than it looks: `hiddenProductIds` is set first, and
 *    `allowedEntityIds` is the value the closure walk on the next line is
 *    computing — so `isRefExcludedDuringClosureWalk` is handed to that walk
 *    as one of that call's own arguments — while `allowedEntityIds`, and only
 *    it, is still null. The
 *    output-line filter reads both later, through `isOmittedFromOutput` ->
 *    `willBeEmitted`, so neither can be a snapshot taken before the walk ran —
 *    that is the invariant the #2637 regression broke.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT on the pass, and why: `isOmittedFromOutput`,
 * `mayNameOmittedRefs` and
 * `overlayNewEntityCount` are eagerly-computed values whose value is only
 * defined after work that runs past this construction site, so hoisting them
 * would change what they compute rather than where they are named;
 * `generatedTypeOwnedPsetIds` is read in one phase only — a local inside
 * `step-property-sets.ts:generatePropertyAndQuantitySetEntities`, which holds
 * both the loop that writes it and the loop that reads it (#2475).
