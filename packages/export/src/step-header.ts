/**
 * The header/assembly tail of `StepExporter.export()` (#2475, the last seam
 * this issue names): building the FILE_DESCRIPTION/HEADER text and turning
 * the finished `ExportPass.entities` into the returned `StepExportResult`.
 *
 * Both functions here are pure — neither reads `this.dataStore`,
 * `this.mutationView`, nor any of `ExportPass`'s three adversarial-review
 * predicates (`isOmittedFromOutput`, `mayNameOmittedRefs`,
 * `hasAnyUnreadableSourceRef`). Those stay in `step-exporter.ts`: their last
 * reader is `writeOverlayCreatedEntities`, several statements before this
 * tail begins, and nothing here reads them back. That is the same test
 * `step-collection.ts` applied when it left them in place (#2475 collection
 * step) — moving them here would relocate a dependency, not remove one.
 *
 * `buildStepHeader` is `pass.buildHeader`'s body, unchanged: `export()`
 * still builds the closure (it needs to close over the per-call `options`
 * and the two call sites still read `pass.buildHeader`), but the closure
 * now just forwards here instead of carrying the logic itself.
 *
 * `assembleExportResult` is the true final phase from the original
 * decomposition table (settle the ledger, build the header, assemble): it is
 * NOT used by the earlier `deltaOnly`-empty-export early return, which
 * hand-builds its own (shorter) `StepExportResult` because it skips
 * `assembleStepBytes` entirely — see the comment at that call site in
 * `step-exporter.ts`.

 * field — to spell out a value this function never consults. Spelled-out
 * values are how two implementations' defaults drift apart unnoticed.
