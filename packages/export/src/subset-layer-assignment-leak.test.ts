/**
 * #3875, the `subsetEntityIds` half: a shared `IfcPresentationLayerAssignment`
 * must not carry an EXCLUDED product's geometry into a subset export, and the
 * layer itself must still be rescued rather than silently dropped.
 *
 * `step-exporter.test.ts` pins this for `visibleOnly` (one CAD layer naming a
 * visible and a hidden wall's shape representation) against a mock store. The
 * issue names FOUR export paths, and `subsetEntityIds` is the one the
 * anonymize export ultimately writes through, so it gets its own pin — through
 * a REAL parsed fixture, per this package's "assert behaviour through a real
 * fixture" rule, which also exercises the real `byType` index
 * `collectStyleEntities` reverse-scans rather than a hand-built one.
 *
 * Scope, precisely: the subset id set is handed to `StepExporter.export`
 * directly, so what is pinned here is the EXPORT's treatment of a subset, not
 * `getSubsetEntityIds`'s choice of roots. `subset-roots.test.ts` owns the
 * latter; a regression that widened the root selection would not show up in
 * this file.
 *
 * Both defects in one fixture, because they pull in opposite directions and a
 * fix for either alone would still pass half of this file:
 *
 *  - the LEAK (confidentiality): the excluded wall's own shape representation
 *    and solid, reachable from no included root except through the shared
 *    layer, must not appear;
 *  - the DROP (silent data loss): the layer assignment itself, which nothing
 *    in the file points back at, must still be rescued for the wall that IS
 *    in the subset, and its `AssignedItems` narrowed to the surviving member
 *    rather than shipped naming a line the export never wrote.
