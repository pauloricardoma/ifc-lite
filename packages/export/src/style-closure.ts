/**
 * Collect style and presentation-layer entities (IFCSTYLEDITEM,
 * IFCSTYLEDREPRESENTATION, IFCPRESENTATIONLAYERASSIGNMENT,
 * IFCPRESENTATIONLAYERWITHSTYLE) that reference geometry already in the
 * closure, then transitively follow their own references.
 *
 * In IFC STEP, IFCSTYLEDITEM references a geometry RepresentationItem, but
 * nothing references the StyledItem back — and IFCPRESENTATIONLAYERASSIGNMENT
 * is the same shape: it names the representation/items assigned to a layer
 * (`AssignedItems`) but nothing points back at the assignment itself. So the
 * forward closure walk misses both entirely. This function does one reverse
 * pass using the byType index: for each candidate, check if any referenced ID
 * is in the closure. If yes, add it and walk its own reference chain in.
 *
 * ## Why the forward walk needs more than `excludeIds`
 *
 * `excludeIds` (`hiddenProductIds`) only ever holds PRODUCT ids, never the
 * geometry those products exclusively own. `IfcPresentationLayerAssignment.
 * AssignedItems` routinely names REPRESENTATION-level ids directly (one CAD
 * layer naming every wall's `IfcShapeRepresentation`), so a shared layer
 * assignment can legitimately be rescued by a VISIBLE wall's representation
 * while also naming a HIDDEN wall's — an id nowhere in `excludeIds`. A plain
 * `excludeIds.has(id)` check (the shape `collectGeoreferencingEntities` uses)
 * would miss that id entirely and resurrect the hidden wall's geometry.
 *
 * The fix relies on an invariant this function's own contract already
 * guarantees: it runs strictly AFTER `collectReferencedEntityIds`, which has
 * already walked the FULL forward closure from every visible root. So any
 * geometry/representation-classified entity (`isGeometryEntity`) that is
 * NOT already in `closure` by the time this pass starts has no other path to
 * visibility — it is either exclusively owned by an excluded product, or
 * genuinely unreferenced by any visible root — and must not be resurrected
 * just because it happens to sit in the same `AssignedItems`/`Item` list as
 * something that IS visible. Presentation RESOURCE types (colours, surface
 * styles — see `STYLE_RESOURCE_EXEMPT_TYPES`) are the one exception: they are
 * shared data, never product-exclusive, so the pre-existing "pull in the
 * style chain" behaviour for them is preserved unconditionally.
 *
 * `excludeIds` is still threaded through and checked directly (matching
 * `collectGeoreferencingEntities`'s shape) as a second, cheap guard — e.g. if
 * a future entity ever names an excluded id that is not geometry-classified.
 *
 * Uses byType for O(candidates) instead of O(allEntities), and byte-level
 * scanning for #ID extraction.
 *
 * Must be called AFTER collectReferencedEntityIds so the closure is complete.
 *
 * @param closure - The existing closure set (mutated in place)
 * @param source - The original STEP file source buffer
 * @param entityIndex - Full entity index with type info and byType lookup
 * @param excludeIds - Entity IDs to never add, even if they reference the
 *   closure (e.g. `pass.hiddenProductIds` / a subset export's `excludedIds`)
