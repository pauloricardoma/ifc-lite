/**
 * Split a STEP argument list on top-level commas while preserving nested syntax,
 * or null when the text is not a well-formed argument list.
 *
 * Similar to `splitTopLevelListItems` but uses a slightly different accumulation style
 * suited for the {@link replaceStepArgument} call-site.
 *
 * ## Why it validates
 *
 * The scan already tracks quote state and paren depth to know where a top-level
 * comma is. It used to ignore the final state, so text that never left a string
 * or never closed a list still produced parts — parts whose boundaries are
 * wherever the scanner happened to be, not the record's slots. Both callers then
 * acted on them: `replaceStepArgument` wrote a slot by index and reported
 * success, and the unit rescale multiplied numbers in whatever argument the
 * mis-split had put them in. Neither could tell, because a broken split looks
 * exactly like a good one.
 *
 * Rejected, because after either of these the parts are no longer the record's
 * arguments — commas were swallowed and everything past them shifted:
 *   - a quote left open at the end (unterminated string);
 *   - a paren depth that does not return to zero, or that ever goes below it
 *     (unbalanced or stray-closing nested list). Both ends matter: a depth that
 *     dips negative and climbs back looks balanced at the end while every comma
 *     in between was read as nested.
 *
 * A part whose parentheses nest deeper than the per-slot grammar's bound is
 * refused the same way — see `MAX_SLOT_NESTING_DEPTH` in `step-slot-grammar.ts`
 * for why that bound exists and how the number was chosen. It is the one
 * rejection here that is not about the record's text being wrong; it is what
 * keeps this function's answer to "parts, or null" total, instead of letting a
 * deeply nested list reach the caller as a thrown `RangeError` nothing handles.
 *
 * An EMPTY top-level slot (`a,,b`, or a trailing comma) is deliberately NOT
 * rejected, though it is invalid STEP. It costs no alignment: an empty argument
 * is ONE part, exactly as the entity parser counts it, so every index still
 * names the attribute it is meant to and the replacement lands where it should.
 * Rejecting it made things strictly worse, and measurably: the parser resolves
 * `HasPropertySets` on such a line, so a session deleting that type object's
 * property set has already had the pset's lines WITHHELD by the time the repoint
 * runs — refuse the repoint and the record keeps a `#id` pointing at a property
 * set the export just dropped. A dangling reference is worse than a
 * still-invalid-but-unchanged empty slot.
 *
 * An empty INPUT is not an empty slot: `#1=IFCFOO();` is a record with no
 * arguments, so it splits to `[]` and any slot request then fails the bounds
 * check in {@link replaceStepArgument} — which is the right answer for a record
 * that has no slots.
