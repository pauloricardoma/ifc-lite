/**
 * Reference collector for IFC STEP export filtering.
 *
 * Walks #ID references transitively from a set of root entities to build
 * the complete closure of all entities that must be included for a valid
 * STEP file. Used for visible-only export and merged export.
 *
 * KEY DESIGN: In IFC STEP files, the reference graph is:
 *   - Products reference geometry (Product → Placement → CartesianPoint)
 *   - Relationships reference products (Rel → Product, NOT Product → Rel)
 *   - Properties are reached via relationships (Rel → PropertySet → Property)
 *
 * For visible-only export, we need:
 *   1. Infrastructure + spatial structure (always included)
 *   2. Visible product entities (checked against hidden/isolated)
 *   3. Relationship entities (always included as roots — they reference products)
 *   4. Forward closure from the above roots pulls in geometry, properties, etc.
 *   5. Hidden product IDs are BLOCKED during the closure walk so their
 *      exclusively-referenced geometry doesn't get pulled in.
 *   6. IfcStyledItem entities are collected in a reverse pass after the closure
 *      because they reference geometry but nothing references them back.
 *   7. Openings whose parent element is hidden are also excluded
 *      (via IfcRelVoidsElement propagation).

/**
 * Collect all entity IDs transitively referenced from a set of root entities.
 *
 * Starting from `rootIds`, reads each entity's raw bytes from the source buffer
 * and extracts all `#ID` references via byte-level scanning (no string
 * allocation). Recursively follows references to build a complete closure
 * that guarantees referential integrity.
 *
 * @param rootIds - Seed entity IDs to start the walk from
 * @param source - The original STEP file source buffer
 * @param entityIndex - Map of expressId → byte position in source. An index
 *   that also answers `refsOf` (see `EffectiveEntityIndex`) contributes
 *   overlay-created records, whose references live in an authored attribute
 *   list rather than in the source buffer — without that hook the walk stops
 *   dead at a created entity and everything reachable only through it is
 *   silently dropped from the export (#2012).
 * @param excludeIds - Entity IDs to NEVER follow during the walk. Also gates
 *   whether an `IFCREL*` entity may act as a BRIDGE into what it references:
 *   when every id it names would be filtered out by
 *   {@link filterHiddenRefsFromRelationshipLine} (same predicate — the
 *   relationship's own line would be withheld entirely), the walk does not
 *   follow ANY of its references. Without this, a relationship whose sole
 *   subject is excluded still pulled its pset/material/type/classification
 *   target into the closure — those are never themselves in `excludeIds` (not
 *   products) — so the target shipped as an orphan line nothing in the output
 *   names (#2548).
 * @param isRefExcluded - The caller's own "is this id excluded from what a
 *   relationship names" predicate for the BRIDGE decision. When supplied, the
 *   bridge uses THIS predicate instead of inventing
 *   `excludeIds.has(id) || !entityIndex.has(id)` as a proxy for it. The proxy
 *   and a caller's real predicate can disagree on an id that never existed in
 *   the file at all (not hidden, not deleted — just absent, e.g. a
 *   pre-existing dangling ref in a truncated source): the proxy treats "not in
 *   the index" as excluded, blocking the bridge, while a caller whose
 *   predicate only excludes a hidden PRODUCT or a TOMBSTONED id does not, and
 *   still emits the relationship's line naming it. Left to disagree, that
 *   combination drops a VISIBLE sibling's pset from the closure while the
 *   unfiltered output line still names it — a dangling ref the emission pass
 *   did not intend to create. Callers with no caller-side predicate to share
 *   (`demesh-prune.ts`, `merged-exporter.ts`, whose own `IFCREL*` output-line
 *   filter already reduces to the same `!entityIndex.has` proxy) omit this and
 *   keep the previous behaviour.
 *
 *   NOT NECESSARILY THE CALLER'S OUTPUT PREDICATE. #2637's remedy was worded
 *   as "the same function call, not two expressions that happened to agree",
 *   and `StepExporter` did pass its single output predicate here. It no longer
 *   can: its output filter is now `isOmittedFromOutput`, built on
 *   `willBeEmitted`, whose first
 *   act is to consult the very `allowedEntityIds` set THIS call produces, so
 *   wiring it in is circular (measured: `ReferenceError: Cannot access
 *   'willBeEmitted' before initialization`; hoisting past the TDZ only trades
 *   the throw for a predicate whose answer changes as the set fills).
 *   `StepExporter` therefore passes the narrower
 *   `isRefExcludedDuringClosureWalk` — hidden product or tombstone — while its
 *   output filter also answers for the closure, an unreadable source ref and a
 *   geometry exclusion.
 *
 *   The two are ORDERED, not merely different: every id the walk predicate
 *   excludes, the output predicate excludes too. So a relationship the walk
 *   refuses to bridge is also one the output withholds, and the #2548 orphan
 *   this parameter exists to prevent cannot come back that way. The reverse
 *   gap is open and observable: for an id the walk admits and the output
 *   omits, the walk bridges through a relationship the output then withholds,
 *   leaving its target in the closure with nothing naming it. Pinned by
 *   `unreadable-ref-dangling.test.ts` ("walk and output predicates diverge"),
 *   and an open design question rather than a settled contract.
 *
 * Performance: O(total bytes of included entities). Each entity visited once.
 * Uses byte-level scanning — no TextDecoder, no regex, no string allocation —
 * except for a SOURCE-BACKED `IFCREL*` entity when `excludeIds` was passed at
 * all, which decodes and parses its line once, for BOTH the bridge decision
 * and the refs enqueued (the same parsed groups feed both — see
 * `sourceRelGroups` below), rather than once per purpose.

 * exact gap).
 *
 * Fixed here rather than by teaching the closure to special-case every
 * `IFCREL*` subtype: the two shapes below are SYNTACTIC, not semantic, so one
 * function covers every relationship class without a table of which attribute
 * index means what per type.
 *
 *  - A `#N` inside a NESTED parenthesised list (`RelatedObjects`,
 *    `RelatedElements`, …): drop just that member. If every member of the
 *    list was hidden, the list is empty — a SET attribute of a real IFC schema
 *    is never empty, so an empty list is not "no forward reference", it is a
 *    second, different kind of invalid file. Withhold the whole line instead.
 *  - A bare top-level `#N` (`RelatingSpace`, `RelatedOpeningElement`, …): a
 *    single-valued STEP attribute has no spelling for "omitted but this one
 *    was mandatory", so a hidden reference here withholds the whole line —
 *    the same choice `propagateOpeningExclusions` already makes for the one
 *    case (`IfcRelVoidsElement`, relating side hidden) it special-cased before
 *    this function existed.
 *
 * Returns the line unchanged when it names nothing excluded, a rewritten line
 * when a list member was dropped, or `null` to mean "do not emit this
 * relationship at all". A line this cannot parse as a single `#N=TYPE(...);`
 * record is returned unchanged — the source-iteration pass's own byte-range
 * and mutation passes are what validate that shape; this function only ever
 * narrows what a well-formed one contains.
 *
 * `isExcluded` is a predicate rather than a fixed `Set` because "excluded"
 * has two independent sources that a caller may need to combine: a
 * `visibleOnly` hidden PRODUCT id (`hiddenProductIds`, a plain membership
 * test) and a TOMBSTONED id (`effective.isDeleted`, answered by the overlay
 * for every id, not just a precomputed set) — the DELETION-path instance of
 * this exact dangling-ref shape (#2398): a relationship that still names an
 * entity the session deleted ships the same `#N` with no `#N=` line, on a
 * path with no `visibleOnly` involved at all.

 * scan that justifies it is exact for the schemas this repo ships (IFC2X3,
 * IFC4, IFC4X3) and covers a single position of a single entity type, so a
 * position-indexed special case is bounded and checkable; a general table
 * would need every `IFCREL*` attribute's optionality across three schemas

 * 10, so `IFCRELCONNECTSWITHECCENTRICITY` — the one subtype, which appends
 * `ConnectionConstraint` as an 11th, MANDATORY attribute and pushes
 * `ConditionCoordinateSystem` to position 9 of 11 — is excluded from this
