- [#5257](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5257) [`8d45322`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8d45322f544ba1c3a6352303dfb048cc5d3836a6) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix model bounds staying poisoned for the rest of a load after one corrupted vertex ([#5210](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5210)). The sampling bounds path (the default for WASM-streamed models) skipped the per-vertex validity filter, so a single garbage vertex widened the accumulated bounds permanently. Each sampled batch result is now checked once; a batch with a bound beyond the 10,000 km sanity limit is recomputed through the filtered path, which drops only the garbage vertex. The recovery is counted in the new optional `CoordinateInfo.boundsRecoveryFallbackCount`, reported by `getCurrentCoordinateInfo()` and `getFinalCoordinateInfo()`.

A silent `scan-shard` reply now falls back to the serial pre-pass; a silent `resolve-styles-shard` slice is treated as empty and the load proceeds with the slices that answered; a silent `finalize-styles` reply drains every held chunk with default colours. Each bound scales with file size and records a typed `failuresByReason` entry (`shard-scan-timeout` / `style-slice-timeout` / `styles-finalize-timeout`) in `GeometryDiagnostics` — the happy path where nothing hangs is byte-identical and emits none of them ([#4902](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4902)).

### Minor Changes

- [#4906](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4906) [`8ccfa05`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8ccfa0573331dc2ecc602b74945f8cc54229829b) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - A federation no longer renders a different scene depending on which model loaded first. Previously, loading a small-coordinate model (no RTC offset) before a large-coordinate one left the small model in the raw frame while the large model used its own anchor, and `federationFrameInfo` reported a frame the large model was not drawn in. Now, after every federated load settles, the viewer converges every loaded model onto one anchor: the earliest-loaded model with a `wasmRtcOffset`. It reads the final set of loaded models, so loads that overlap and finish in either order end in the same scene. `federationFrameInfo` applies the same rule, so a near-origin model or a raw point cloud loaded first no longer defines the reported frame.
  
  The new `@ifc-lite/geometry/rtc-rebase` module (`convergeGeometryOntoRtcAnchor`) moves a model by translating each mesh's double-precision `origin` and its `coordinateInfo` (`wasmRtcOffset`, `wasmRtcFrame`, `originalBounds`, `shiftedBounds`). The float32 vertex `positions` never change, so millimetre detail survives map-coordinate anchors, where one float32 step is 0.25 to 0.5 m. The absolute-world `geometryAabb` and `localToWorld` fields are RTC-invariant and are left alone. The viewer withdraws a moved model's spatial index before rebuilding it.
  
  Point clouds are never moved, because they never join the RTC frame. A model with GPU-instanced geometry cannot be moved after load: the viewer names it in a warning and still converges every other model.

- [#4888](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4888) [`6a9fc13`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6a9fc132731132bbbec2d9241242ae99e063a27e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - A single element whose geometry never finishes no longer has to fail the whole load with "Geometry stream stalled". `processAdaptive` and `processParallel` accept a new opt-in `hungJobTimeoutMs` (use `DEFAULT_HUNG_JOB_TIMEOUT_MS`, 45 s). With it, the parallel pool replaces a worker stuck inside one geometry call, re-runs that call one element at a time, and skips only an element that stays silent for twice the budget. It reports those elements on `complete.skippedHungElements` (express ids and counts by IFC type) and keeps the replaced worker's diagnostics. Recovery is off unless requested, so a consumer that does not read `skippedHungElements` never receives a partial model. A new `signal` option terminates the worker pool when a consumer abandons the stream, which `return()` alone could not do while the stream waited on a silent worker. The viewer opts in, tells the user which element types were left out, never caches a partial model, and aborts the pool when it closes a stream.

### Patch Changes

- [#4920](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4920) [`603d987`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/603d9872bef5d340cccfc76fe0708f2feaafad49) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Correct the `hasLargeCoordinates` docstring on `CoordinateInfo`: it only
  tracks whether the JS-side `originShift` fired, and stays `false` when the
  WASM mesh pass already re-based the model onto `wasmRtcOffset` instead.
  Neither field alone is a general "was this model shifted?" flag; use
  `hasLargeCoordinates || wasmRtcOffset !== undefined`. No behaviour change.

A new `@ifc-lite/geometry/world-frame` entry point holds the one render frame <-> world conversion (`renderFrameWorldOffset`, `totalYupOffset`, `ifcToViewerAxes`, `viewerToIfcAxes`, `federationFrameInfo`), which the viewer, CLI, playground and SDK all use. `@ifc-lite/bcf` adds `viewpointFromWorld`, the inverse of `translateViewpoint` that keeps viewpoints written by ifc-lite before [#4806](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4806) in place. In the SDK, `ViewerBackendMethods` gains an optional `getRenderFrameOffset()`; when a backend provides it (the viewer does), `bim.bcf.createViewpoint()` adds it and `bim.bcf.extractViewpointState()` subtracts it, so viewpoints are world coordinates and extracted cameras are ready for `bim.viewer.setCamera()`. Backends without it, and `new BCFNamespace()` with no backend, behave as before.

No behaviour change: every copy held the same rule, which is what made the drift invisible. The viewer's map-absolute detection radius now imports that same constant instead of repeating its value; the radius is unchanged at 10 km.

Use `exportKmzFromMeshes`, which embeds the supported COLLADA model format.

- [#4642](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4642) [`be2fed0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/be2fed0945e7dff83e3fb5d9ba810f0b5a6339a7) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `setEntityIndex`, `finalizePrepassStyles` and `buildPrePassStreamingSharded` now throw when their parallel column arguments disagree in length, instead of trapping the worker instance (`panic=abort`) or silently doing nothing. A rejected `setEntityIndex` also drops the previous file's index, content caches and pipeline diagnostics before it throws, so a worker reused across loads no longer resolves the next file's references through the previous file's byte offsets. Calling `setEntityIndex` with empty columns now clears the index, and the next batch scans its bytes. The geometry worker no longer replays a rejected entity index when it re-initialises its IfcAPI.
  
  **Migration:** callers must be ready for `setEntityIndex`, `finalizePrepassStyles` and `buildPrePassStreamingSharded` to throw on columns of unequal length (`finalizePrepassStyles` needs exactly four colour floats per id). A caller that used `setEntityIndex` with empty columns as a no-op that kept the current index must stop doing so: it now clears the index.

### Patch Changes

- [#4664](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4664) [`b4bc7df`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b4bc7df25e9cdcd6c46f4affd289c0b3da7829fa) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix JSON-LD and STEP export silently exporting the whole model when an active isolation filter matches zero entities — the last two formats still carrying the null-vs-empty collapse that [#4364](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4364) removed for GLB and [#4386](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4386) for OBJ.
  
  Measured on `hello-wall.ifc` before the fix: a zero-match `jsonld` export was byte-identical to a whole-model one (1491 bytes, 9 `@graph` nodes both ways), as was `step` (79580 bytes, 1045 entities both ways), while a real `IfcWall` filter narrowed correctly to 1 node / 46 entities. The two calls were in fact indistinguishable, because the signature could not express the difference.
  
  The `exportJsonld` / `exportStep` wasm bindings took a bare slice and mapped an empty one back to "no filter." Both bindings now use `Option<Vec<u32>>` (`None` = no filter, `Some(ids)` = an active allowlist, empty or not), exposed as `Uint32Array | undefined` in `GeometryProcessor` and `IfcLiteBridge`. JSON-LD's stable Rust `JsonLdOptions::included: Vec<u32>` field keeps its existing shape and behavior for downstream callers; the additive `export_jsonld_with_filter` entry point carries the explicit optional filter used by wasm. An active-but-empty filter now yields an empty `@graph` and a header-only STEP file instead of the whole model. `ifc_lite_export::export_step_json` already took an `Option` and needed no change; only the binding above it did.
  
  Mirroring the same-PR follow-up [#4364](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4364) and [#4386](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4386) each needed: `ifc-lite export --format jsonld|step` (`packages/cli/src/commands/export-rust-formats.ts`) used to pass an explicit empty `Uint32Array` whenever no `--type`/`--storey`/`--where`/`--limit` filter was requested, which under the new convention would read as "isolation active, matches nothing" and fail-close every unfiltered export. Both branches now pass `undefined` when their filter is inactive. There is no MCP or viewer caller to update: the MCP server exposes no JSON-LD or STEP export tool, and the viewer's STEP path is the TypeScript `StepExporter`, not this binding.
  
  Also closes the guard asymmetry these two formats had with their siblings. `obj` and `gltf`/`glb` each carry a second, independent check on the produced artifact, so neutering the CLI's shared zero-match guard still leaves them failing closed; `jsonld` and `step` had that guard and nothing else. `@ifc-lite/export` gains `countJsonldNodes` and `countStepEntities` (`packages/export/src/zero-content.ts`) — both writers emit a valid, non-zero-byte document even when every entity is filtered out (JSON-LD keeps its `@context`, the STEP writer regenerates its ISO-10303-21 header), so a byte-length check cannot see an empty export and node/entity count is the content signal. The CLI's `jsonld` and `step` branches now `fatal()` when either comes back 0.
  
  That second check is reachable on its own, not only behind the zero-match guard: `ifc-lite export --format jsonld --type IfcProject` matches an entity but produces no `@graph` node, and used to write that empty document as a reported success.

### Major Changes

- [#4628](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4628) [`5583362`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/5583362ea8d7c988c84d44bf3b27c6c72fb6b798) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Keep the public geometry bridge and downloadable server binary aligned with the implementations they expose.
  
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: `GeometryProcessor.getApi()` and `IfcLiteBridge.getApi()` expose the concrete `@ifc-lite/wasm` `IfcAPI`, so the breaking PDF-fidelity and scan-transfer JSON migrations in WASM 8 are also breaking for callers that obtain the API through Geometry. Geometry therefore advances to 6.0.0 instead of accepting only a dependency patch.
  - `@ifc-lite/server-bin`: publish fresh binaries containing the server-release unwinding profile, the bounded stalled-stream permit timeout, and bounded cache-invalidation walks. The previous 1.17.0 package resolves the older September 4 binary release and cannot contain those fixes.

### Major Changes

- [#4364](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4364) [`c952d49`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/c952d497c424ec15b972d87b878b41bf0573460b) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix GLB export silently exporting the whole model when an active isolation filter matches zero elements (reachable through "Export Visible Only" after filtering the hierarchy panel's Class tab to a type present only in a federated model's other member — the [#4328](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4328) scenario, for the GLB exporter specifically).
  
  `GltfOptions::isolated` (Rust) and `GeometryProcessor.exportGlb`'s `isolated` parameter (TS, across the wasm boundary) collapsed "no isolation filter" and "isolation active, zero matches" into the same empty value, so both read as "export everything". They now distinguish the two the way `packages/export/src/reference-collector.ts` and `packages/renderer/src/entity-visibility.ts` already do: `isolated: Option<Vec<u32>>` on the Rust side (`None` = no filter, `Some(ids)` = an active allowlist, empty or not), `Uint32Array | undefined` on the TS side (`undefined` = no filter, an empty array = active but matching nothing). `GLBExportDialog.tsx`'s two assemblers (from-meshes and the from-bytes/wasm fast path) both preserve this distinction end to end instead of collapsing it back to a boolean.
  
  Same-PR follow-up: `ifc-lite export --format glb`/`gltf` (`packages/cli/src/commands/export-rust-formats.ts`) and the MCP `export_glb` tool (`packages/mcp/src/tools/export.ts`) both pass an explicit empty `Uint32Array` to `exportGlb` whenever no `--type`/`type` filter is requested — under the new convention that reads as "isolation active, matches nothing" and made every unfiltered GLB export fail closed with a misleading "0 meshes" error. Both now pass `undefined` when their filter is inactive.

  `ObjOptions::isolated` (Rust, `rust/export/src/obj.rs`) and the wasm `exportObj` binding (`rust/wasm-bindings/src/api/export_obj.rs`) collapsed "no isolation filter" and "isolation active, zero matches" into the same empty value via `Vec::is_empty()`, so both read as "export everything". They now distinguish the two the same way `GltfOptions::isolated` does after [#4364](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4364): `isolated: Option<Vec<u32>>` on the Rust side (`None` = no filter, `Some(ids)` = an active allowlist, empty or not), `Uint32Array | undefined` on the TS side (`undefined` = no filter, an empty array = active but matching nothing) — `GeometryProcessor.exportObj` / `IfcLiteBridge.exportObj` in `packages/geometry/src`.
  
  Same-PR follow-up, mirroring the one [#4364](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4364) needed for GLB: `ifc-lite export --format obj` (`packages/cli/src/commands/export-rust-formats.ts`) and the MCP `export_obj` tool (`packages/mcp/src/tools/export.ts`) both used to pass an explicit empty `Uint32Array` to `exportObj` whenever no `--type`/`type` filter was requested — under the new convention that reads as "isolation active, matches nothing" and would have made every unfiltered OBJ export fail closed with a misleading "0 meshes" error. Both now pass `undefined` when their filter is inactive.
  
  Also adds a zero-output guard to the CLI's OBJ export path, closing the asymmetry with GLB's `countGlbMeshes` defense-in-depth check: unlike `exportGlb`, the Rust OBJ exporter has no "no render geometry" error signal — it always returns a string, even a header-only one with zero vertices. `@ifc-lite/export` gains `countObjVertices` (`packages/export/src/obj.ts`), and `export-rust-formats.ts`'s OBJ branch now `fatal()`s when it comes back 0 rather than writing that small-but-non-zero-byte file as a reported success.
  
  `packages/geometry/src/index.ts`'s two isolation-semantics doc comments (added for `exportObj`, already present for `exportGlb`-adjacent code) are folded into the existing exporter docblock rather than left as a second block, to stay under `check-module-size.mjs`'s ratchet once `main`'s current budget for this file applies — no information lost, just consolidated.

### Patch Changes

  `packages/renderer/src/{bvh,raycaster,snap-detector}.ts`, `packages/geometry/src/huge-file-error.ts` and three test files carried no license notice at all. `scripts/add-license-headers.mjs --check` now runs in CI, so the omission cannot recur.

- [#4306](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4306) [`a6976b9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a6976b9da44d13157533372a8def23995fcfb93f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - New `@ifc-lite/wasm-lifecycle` package: extracts the WASM engine load-retry classification (`initWasmWithRetry`, `isTransientWasmLoadError`) and the cross-realm panic-location forwarder (`takeWasmPanicStash`, `restashWasmPanicLocation`) that `@ifc-lite/geometry` and `@ifc-lite/parser` each carried as an independently-editable "twin" copy, with nothing enforcing the two stayed in sync ([#4247](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4247)).
  
  `@ifc-lite/wasm` — the one package both consumers already depend on — was deliberately not used as the shared home: it ships only the wasm-pack build output with no TypeScript build step, so a hand-written module there would gate every geometry/parser test run on a full Rust→wasm rebuild. `@ifc-lite/wasm-lifecycle` is a plain TypeScript package (its own `tsc` build, same shape as `@ifc-lite/regex-guard`) with no wasm dependency of its own, so it avoids that cost.
  
  `@ifc-lite/geometry` and `@ifc-lite/parser` now each re-export the shared module from their own `wasm-init-retry.ts` / `wasm-panic-forward.ts`, so existing imports are unchanged. No behavior change in either package.

The Rust exporter already computed the coverage stats (`spaces` seen, `rooms` emitted, `skipped`) but they never crossed the wasm boundary — `GeometryProcessor.exportHbjson` / `IfcLiteBridge.exportHbjson` only ever returned the raw bytes.
  
  Added `GeometryProcessor.exportHbjsonWithStats(buffer, name)` and `IfcLiteBridge.exportHbjsonWithStats(content, name)`, returning `{ content: Uint8Array; stats: HbjsonStats }` alongside the existing byte-only methods (unchanged, still supported). `HbjsonStats` (also exported) carries `spaces`, `rooms`, `skipped`, `apertures`, `doors`, `shades`, `constructions`, and `interiorAdjacencies`, mirroring the Rust `ifc_lite_export::HbjsonStats` contract.

  The instancing path has always been per representation item — `collect_submeshes_from_item_inner` emits one sub-mesh per item and tags it with that item's express id, which is why a two-solid `IfcRepresentationMap` instanced N times produces two templates rather than one. The id was computed at every step and then dropped: `RawInstanceOccurrence` had no field for it even though the colour lookup one line up already read `sub.geometry_id`, and the `InstanceMeshRef` the browser batch hands the encoder had none either, which lost it for the template as well as for its occurrences. A flat mesh reported `geometryItemId`; the same geometry, instanced, reported nothing — and "no item id" is indistinguishable from "this geometry has no item", so the loss was silent.
  
  The IFNS wire format goes to version 2 to carry it. Header word 7, written as a literal `0` and read by nobody in v1, becomes the instance record STRIDE IN BYTES: 88 for the base record (templateIndex, entityId, colour, transform), 92 when it also carries the trailing `itemId` u32. The stride is now DERIVED from that word in one place per language rather than repeated as a literal in four, and the encoder derives it from the DATA — a model whose producer names no representation item writes 88-byte records rather than 4 bytes of zeros per occurrence (~800 KB on a 200k-occurrence model, written, cached verbatim and re-read on every load).
  
  A stride rather than a flags word, because per-instance fields are APPEND-ONLY in a fixed canonical order and the stride is what tells a reader how many trailing fields are present. A decoder must REJECT a flag bit it does not know — an unknown bit changes the stride unknowably — so flags buy no forward compatibility over the version word they duplicate. A stride the decoder READS buys exactly that, and both suites prove it against bytes rather than prose: a synthesised version-3 shard at stride 96 (base + itemId + 4 bytes of a field that does not exist yet) decodes here with every known field intact and the unknown tail stepped over.
  
  Both decoders became PERMISSIVE on version: v1 (stride 88, no trailing fields) and any version at or above 2 whose declared stride is readable and valid. So the v1 shards already sitting in browser caches still load, reporting no item id rather than failing. The strictness moved to where it belongs — the stride: below the 88-byte base record, not a multiple of 4, or too large for the instance table it implies to fit the buffer, is refused, because a mis-strided read yields plausible garbage instead of an error. Version 0 is refused. The claim is tested against bytes rather than asserted: a real v1 shard, frozen in both the Rust and the TypeScript suite and never regenerated, is decoded by the current decoders and round-tripped through the cache section.
  
  The alignment rule is there because the two statements of the format have to refuse the same shards. The TypeScript decoder views the pooled data as `Float32Array` over the shard buffer, so an odd stride pushes that offset off a 4-byte multiple (stride 90 with one template and one instance lands on 170) and the view constructor throws an opaque `RangeError`; Rust reads the identical bytes through byte slices and decoded every base field happily. On a shard the permissive-version rule promises to read, one side used to succeed and the other to fail with the wrong error.
  
  **ONE CACHE INVALIDATION, DELIBERATELY.** `@ifc-lite/cache`'s `FORMAT_VERSION` moves 15 → 16, so the viewer's cache key (`ifc-<bytes>-<fingerprint>-v<FORMAT_VERSION>…`) moves with it and every existing entry misses once and re-meshes. That cost buys a closed deploy-skew window. The InstancedShards section stores shard bytes VERBATIM and never re-encodes, so a v2 shard this build writes into IndexedDB would otherwise sit under a key an OLDER bundle also matches — a tab opened before the deploy, an edge still serving the previous build, a rollback. That bundle's decoder is a strict `version !== 1` throw, and `useGeometryStreaming` swallows it with a `console.warn`: every instanced occurrence disappears while the flat geometry keeps drawing, so it reads as missing geometry rather than as a version error. The bump splits the keyspace instead — the old bundle looks for v15, misses, re-parses, and writes v1 shards it can read; this build looks for v16. No shared key.
  
  Belt and braces beside that key, because shard bytes travel by more routes than one key: the encoder writes **version 1** whenever the derived stride is the bare 88-byte base record, with header word 7 at the literal `0` v1 wrote there. Such a shard carries no trailing field, so it IS a v1 shard byte for byte and a pre-[#2985](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2985) decoder reads it. Only a widened 92-byte record claims v2.
  
  The stride predicate is read off the occurrences the encoder actually WRITES — the collated template occurrences plus the flat singletons — not off the input mesh slice. `collate_refs` drops members (an empty non-instanceable mesh, an all-empty representation group), so a batch whose only id-bearing entry was a dropped one used to declare 92 and then write `0` into every record it emitted: the zero-filled widened record the data-derived stride exists to prevent, and a `carriesItemIds: true` that lied to the consumer.
  
  Two smaller gaps on the same terrain close with it, neither needing a wire change. A sub-threshold occurrence that recovers FLAT (`recover_flat` in the browser batch, `recover_orphan_occurrences` in the native finalize) never reaches the shard at all, so its id rides the recovered `MeshData` through `with_style_metadata` instead. And `Scene.getInstancedMeshDataPieces` now stamps `geometryItemId` on each materialized piece, so an exporter or a source-navigation consumer reading instanced geometry is not worse off than one reading flat geometry.
  
  The id stays CPU-side. It is deliberately absent from the GPU per-instance vertex buffer, whose 88-byte layout is packed identically by the instanced pipeline, the shadow pass and the picker: this is host-query data ("which entity produced this piece"), not shading data.
  
  New surface: `DecodedInstance.itemId?` and `DecodedInstancedShard.carriesItemIds` (`@ifc-lite/geometry`), `InstancedRenderTemplate.itemIds?` (`@ifc-lite/renderer`), `item_id` fields on `InstanceMeshRef` / `DecodedInstance` / `RawInstanceOccurrence` / `InstanceRecord` and `MeshData::style_geometry_item_id` / `recover_occurrences_flat` in the Rust crates. Minor rather than patch: the wire version moved and every one of those is an addition to a public surface. `carriesItemIds` is REQUIRED, not optional, and that is the one thing here breaking for a TypeScript consumer who constructs a `DecodedInstancedShard` by hand rather than receiving it from `decodeInstancedShard` (only tests in this repo do). It is required on purpose: it is what a consumer keys the per-occurrence id column off, so an omitted flag would read as "no ids" and drop them silently — absence looking exactly like success, which is the defect this whole change is about.
  
  BREAKING FOR THE RUST CRATES, and this changeset cannot express it. `ifc-lite-geometry` and `ifc-lite-processing` are published to crates.io, and four `pub` structs that callers construct literally gain a `pub` field: `InstanceMeshRef.item_id` and `DecodedInstance.item_id` in geometry, `RawInstanceOccurrence.geometry_item_id` and `InstanceRecord.geometry_item_id` in processing. None is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so any downstream exhaustive struct literal stops compiling — and both breaks are demonstrated in-repo, since the field additions broke the literals in `rust/export/src/gltf.rs`, `rust/export/src/usd/tests.rs` and three `rust/processing/tests/` files. Measured against the published 7.1.1 with `cargo +stable semver-checks check-release -p <crate> --baseline-version 7.1.1 --release-type minor`: both report `constructible_struct_adds_field` and "semver requires new major version" (196 checks, 195 pass, 1 fail). `scripts/sync-versions.js` derives the Cargo version from the highest npm package version, so a `minor` here would ship 7.1.1 → 7.2.0 and break anyone pinned to `ifc-lite-geometry = "7"` on an ordinary `cargo update`. The remedy this repo provides is `rust-major-offset.json`, and this PR APPLIES it: `majorOffset` goes from 1 to 2, in its own commit, with the re-synced Cargo manifests and `Cargo.lock` beside it — the shape [#3326](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3326) established for the 0 → 1 move. `[workspace.package] version` moves 7.1.1 → 8.1.1 as a result, so the crates publish as a major while the npm packages stay on a minor. `node scripts/check-rust-major-offset.mjs` is green on the branch: "Rust crate version 8.1.1: crates run 2 major(s) ahead of npm 6.1.1. 14 internal dependency literal(s) across 8 manifest(s) agree, over 48 workspace package(s) scanned." `scripts/check-rust-semver.mjs` stays the backstop, and it now has something to compare: its "nothing to gate" line appears only when every crate is already on crates.io at the workspace version, and 8.1.1 is not published.

- [#3420](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3420) [`4475e58`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/4475e583ea35def444fb6d7ba92410629bd89096) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Report a refused oversized express id on every load path, not just one ([#3395](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3395)).
  
  Refusing a record whose instance name does not fit `u32` is only half a guard; the other half is saying so. The first version of this fix wired the report into one TypeScript path and one wasm entry point, which left every other consumer returning a model that was quietly short — a missing bound corrupts, a missing report returns a truncated success, and the second failure is the harder one to notice because a load with nothing to refuse looks identical.
  
  **The canonical viewer path.** For a file at or above 2 MB the geometry pre-pass has already scanned it and hands the parser worker its entity-index columns, so `scanIfcEntities` never scans at all. A refused record is absent from those columns by construction, so nothing downstream can recount it. The refusal now travels with them: the pre-pass `entity-index` event carries `oversizedIdCount`, `processParallel`'s `onEntityIndex` callback receives it as a fourth argument, `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex` takes it as an optional fourth parameter, and `PreScannedEntityIndex.oversizedIdCount` feeds it into the existing `console.warn` + `onDiagnostic` report. `EntityScanResult.oversizedIdCount` is therefore trustworthy on the `pre-scanned` path now, where its own documentation previously had to warn that a zero proved nothing.
  
  **A shard hands back offsets, not a count, and does not report.** `scanEntityIndexShard` returns `oversizedIdStarts`, the global start byte of each record that shard refused. A shard begins at an arbitrary byte, so it can start inside a quoted value, and `EntityScanner` has no quote context — its only guard is the shape `#<digits>[ws]*=`, which a string literal containing `[#4294967297](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4294967297)=IFCWALL(` satisfies. A shard therefore refuses records the file never declared, arbitrarily many of them, and a per-shard report would warn "skipped N records" about a file that is fine. The main-thread stitch keeps only the offsets at or after the boundary it validated for that shard — the same boundary its records are cut at — and reports once per load. Native does the same: `build_entity_index_parallel` reports after its stitch, and `ifc_lite_processing::scan_shard_with_refusals` / `scan_shard_classified_with_refusals` hand the offsets to whoever stitches them.
  
  **The native and second-wasm paths.** `ifc_lite_core::report_oversized_ids` is the one place Rust words this report; `build_entity_index`, `ColumnarEntityIndex::from_scan`, `build_entity_index_parallel`, the streaming processor scan and both wasm scan entry points call it, so the CLI, server and Python wheel no longer return a model silently missing the record. It goes to stderr by default, and the wasm bindings point it at the browser console from `#[wasm_bindgen(start)] init()`, which runs when the module loads, because `wasm32` has no stderr to write to.
  
  A refusal stays a **diagnostic, not an error**: `[#4294967297](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4294967297)` is a legal ISO 10303-21 instance name, so failing the load would turn one lost record into a lost file that is otherwise fine, and would make native refuse a file the browser still opens.
  
  The `@ifc-lite/geometry` and `@ifc-lite/wasm` additions are optional or additive, so their
  callers compile and behave unchanged. `@ifc-lite/parser` is NOT: `EntityScanResult` gains a
  REQUIRED `oversizedIdCount`, so anything constructing that shape must supply it. See the
  `parser-express-id-u32-bound` entry for the breaking notice and migration.

- [#3442](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3442) [`2edd144`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/2edd14432999ceeed4c0bb0baf6b2000c1c5b041) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Step 1 of [#3440](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3440): report the boolean results that come back torn.
  
  Every boolean op's accept path validated its kernel output through `validate_mesh`, which checks position/normal finiteness and index bounds and nothing else, so a result with a hole in it was accepted silently and left no trace anywhere. The kernel's boolean entry points (`subtract_mesh`, `subtract_mesh_many`, `union_mesh`, `union_meshes`, `intersection_mesh`) now also run the closure audit the analytic prism-cut path rejects on — `directed_closed`, or failing that the hairline tolerance `closed_or_hairline` — over the mesh each op is about to return, and record a failure through the same channel the CSG diagnostics already report through. The hairline half is not decoration: without it every T-junction subdivision mismatch would be recorded, and tessellated hosts routinely carry those; the analytic path accepts them at every one of its own gates, so a census that counted them could not be read.
  
  This records, it does not gate. `validate_mesh` returns exactly what it returned before, and every op still returns the mesh it returned before. A hard gate here would silently reroute every currently-torn host onto its fallback path across difference, union and intersection at once, and nothing today can say whether those hosts would land better or worse. That measurement is what this diagnostic exists to produce, not something to assume in the same change that adds the check.
  
  Each op audits the mesh it hands back, once. `subtract_mesh_many` audits after the last chunk rather than per chunk, and `union_meshes` audits the union it returns rather than each pairwise intermediate the caller never sees — a record about a mesh nobody receives is noise the per-host count cannot correct for. A group the batched path rejects returns the host un-cut before the audit runs, so it still records nothing, as its contract says.
  
  What changes for you: hosts that previously loaded with no CSG failure recorded can now report one, which moves `totalCsgFailures`, `failuresByReason`, `worstHosts` and `silentNoOps` on the `complete` event's `diagnostics`, and trips the "N CSG failure(s)" console warning. No export is added, removed or renamed and the geometry handed to callers is unchanged, so nothing here forces a code change on your side. The level is `minor` rather than `patch` as a judgement call: a package that starts reporting a new class of diagnostic is doing something new, not correcting what it already reported.
  
  That console warning's wording is corrected in the same change. It claimed "some openings/voids may be left uncut", which was never true of every reason it counted — `CutterUnionUnavailable` and `PolygonalBoundedHalfSpaceFallback` both leave the cut applied — and is not true of the new record at all, where the cut is applied and only the tessellation is not closed. It now points at `diagnostics.failuresByReason` for which reason it actually is.
  
  Cost: one hash sweep over the returned triangles per accepted boolean op, plus the hairline sweep only when the strict audit fails. Measured base (`140a6d854`) versus this branch with `scripts/perf/probe.sh --iters 5`: FZK-Haus stayed at 9 ms best total (geometry 5 -> 4 ms), and the CSG-heavy ISSUE_129 stayed effectively flat at 605 -> 604 ms best total (geometry 586 -> 586 ms). Mesh, vertex and triangle counts were byte-for-byte identical in both runs; ISSUE_129's diagnostic count rose 1 -> 9, which is the intentional new observation rather than a geometry change.

Previously two of these drop sites logged only behind a debug/observability build flag and the other three logged nothing at all, so no build had a signal an element's geometry was missing or incomplete. The viewer now warns in the console when a load drops items; `ifc-lite diagnose-geometry` and `export --diagnostics` print a "Dropped representation items" section.
  
  Only items under a Body representation count. A 2D 'FootPrint' or 'Annotation' representation map, which Revit and ArchiCAD routinely attach to a type, carries `IfcAnnotationFillArea` / `IfcGeometricCurveSet` items that have no processor and are correctly absent from a 3D view; counting those would make a clean model report hundreds of dropped items. A clean model produces no warning.
  
  The count is a lower bound on affected types, not a count of sources or elements: a representation map's dropped item is counted once per walking router, and the native pass builds one router per element while the browser builds one per batch.

Every other pre-pass/worker failure is still captured unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#3431](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3431) [`3efe762`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3efe762a993897fc3ddc029a8de1e5914e27df3f) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Stop widening every window when the authoring tool already cut the hole into the wall.
  
  `extend_opening_mesh_through_host` pushes an opening cutter's cap past a coincident host facet so a flush interface becomes a clean transversal crossing rather than a coplanar graze (issue [#1007](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1007), host [#1112](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1112)). It qualified a cap on coincidence alone. On a host whose Brep already carries the hole, an Archicad wall exported with "Material Preservation: Explode where necessary", where the wall body lives on aggregated `IfcBuildingElementPart` layers and every layer's Brep has its own window, the cutter's side planes coincide with the hole's jambs, so both jambs read as caps and each was pushed 30% of the opening's span into the pier beside it. Every window came out scaled by exactly 1.600 with its centre unmoved, and the piers between them were eaten; on issue [#3219](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3219)'s model that removed 19% to 27% of each wall layer that no authored opening ever occupied.
  
  A cap now has three states rather than two, and the third is the one that makes this shippable. `Free` means no host facet is coincident, so the cutter already crosses cleanly and is left exactly as authored. `Exit` means the opening genuinely leaves the host there, and keeps the identical clearance push [#1007](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1007) depends on. `Jamb` means the host continues past the cap, so pushing would eat the pier.
  
  A jamb is not merely left alone. Leaving it exactly coplanar with the jamb face is a touching-operand graze, and that tears: measured on the corpus, declining the push without moving the cap cost one host 488 additional open edges on its own. On a host that already carries the hole the cutter is redundant, because the correct subtraction removes nothing, so a jamb cap is pulled one coincidence band INTO the existing void. The subtraction then removes nothing by construction rather than by cancellation, and no host face is touched. That pull is bounded by a quarter of the cutter's own span, not only by the coincidence band: the band is floored at 1 mm so a sub-metre opening keeps a usable tolerance, and reusing a tolerance floor as a move distance collapsed a 2 mm cutter to zero width. A quarter is the same fraction that selects which vertices move with a cap, so the move and the selection stay on one scale and cannot be tuned apart. That is a scale bound rather than an ordering guarantee, and the code says so where the constant is defined.
  
  Qualification is unchanged from before this fix: parallel to the cap and lying on its plane, with no footprint filter and an unfiltered record of where the host surface sits. That is deliberate and was verified by construction: with the veto disabled the whole 1170-host census reproduces the previous golden byte for byte, so every difference this change makes is a positive "the push would remove host material" verdict that can be audited one call at a time.
  
  Whether the host continues past a cap is decided by ray parity, not by facet winding. IFC winding is not reliably outward and the host is not oriented until after the cut, so a signed-normal test mis-reads real bodies; an area-weighted winding vote was measured cancelling to exactly zero on the doubled skin an exploded-layer host produces, which silently declined the push. Parity is read from two independent ray directions and believed only when they agree, because a torn shell answers differently depending on where the ray goes.
  
  The veto is suppressed entirely at georeferenced magnitudes. `Mesh` stores positions as f32, so representable positions thin out with magnitude (half a metre apart at 8.2e6) until parity is answering about a shape quantized past recognition, where two ray directions can agree and both be wrong. The existing large-coordinate threshold sits well below where that bites, which is the right side to err on: suppressing the veto falls back to the previous behaviour, which the corpus is already blessed against. The same guard on qualification would be unsound, because declining to qualify cannot restore a push, only withhold one.
  
  Verified against ifcopenshell 0.8.2 and manifold3d on the reporter's model, where the correct subtraction removes zero volume because the holes are already present: the four affected wall layers go from -18.8%, -18.6%, -27.0% and -8.3% volume error to within 0.1%. On the 1170-host watertightness census the change is a net improvement rather than a trade, 20348 unmatched edges against 20453 before, with the two over-cut hosts on the reporter-class model recovering 48 and 94 triangles of material.
  
  The golden moves on 15 hosts, each inspected before blessing: five improve, three are re-tessellations that are smaller and less torn, and seven are flagged regressed. Five of those seven are `Tessellation` open shells where the census will not credit a falling boundary count as repair because a shell's boundary edges are structural. Of the remaining two, one gains two open edges while recovering 90 triangles, and one halves its open edges (104 to 55) while gaining a single snap-collapsed triangle, which is the one place this change is not strictly better.
  
  Two thin `IfcCovering` layers on the same model stay wrong for an unrelated reason (multi-opening cuts tear thin shells open, independent of this pad and unchanged by it) and are tracked separately.

- [#3462](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3462) [`5297514`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/52975142846390bb1eb12b723d53c0e275289a90) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - The synchronous WASM mesh path (`processAdaptive`'s <2MB branch, via `collectMeshesViaPrePass`) now honours a caller-supplied `sharedRtcOffset` for federation alignment, matching the parallel and streaming paths (`geometry-parallel.ts`'s `useSharedRtc`).
  
  Previously only the parallel and streaming WASM paths threaded a caller-supplied `sharedRtcOffset` through to the mesh pass; the sync path silently ignored it and always used the model's own detected RTC offset, so a small (<2MB) federated model rendered at its own origin instead of the shared federation origin its siblings use. `applyPrePassMetadata` and `collectMeshesViaPrePass` now accept an optional `sharedRtcOffset` and, when present, use it (with `needsShift` forced `true`) in place of the pre-pass's own detected offset — the same rule already applied by the parallel/streaming paths.
  
  With [#3455](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3455) having done the same for the single-threaded streaming fallback, all three WASM branches of `processAdaptive` now honour the federation origin; the native/Tauri path (`geometry-native.ts`) still does not.
  
  No performance impact: same code path runs either way, only which RTC offset value is selected changes.

- [#3716](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3716) [`ea81645`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ea81645f7cd47d9e62718a6687f9e780794c2aa2) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `collate_refs` (GPU-instancing collation) trusted a shared `rep_identity` outright: every occurrence in a group was assumed to bake from the same canonical geometry, so its per-instance transform was computed from placement metadata alone, with no check that the assumption actually held. A run over a large multi-model merge measured a `rep_identity` collision between two unrelated occurrences from different source models (same vertex/index counts, genuinely different geometry) that reconstructed up to 2m away from where it actually was, with nothing erroring or warning anywhere on the path. The occurrence still rendered; it was simply in the wrong place ([#3666](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3666)).
  
  `collate_refs` now reconstructs each exact-tier occurrence from `(template, rel)` and verifies it against that occurrence's OWN baked vertices before trusting the pairing, at a tolerance scaled to the vertex's own coordinate magnitude (an f32-ULP-scale relative term, floored at a micrometre near the origin; a fixed epsilon is meaningless at survey-scale coordinates, and a genuine collision's residual clears it by orders of magnitude regardless of scale). A group with any member that fails reconstruction falls back to the flat (unshared) path in its ENTIRETY, not just the failing member: once one pairing is wrong the template itself is in doubt, so keeping members that happen to agree would leave the rest silently exposed to the same failure mode. The RIGID tier (congruent-but-not-bit-identical occurrences, `InstanceMeta::canonical_transform`) is unaffected: its members can legitimately carry a different raw vertex count than the template by design, and its congruence is established upstream of collation.
  
  This trades a small amount of instancing (a colliding or malformed group now renders flat instead of sharing a template) for the guarantee that a consumer of `collate_refs` (the in-memory GLB exporter, the WASM viewer, the Parquet routes) does not ship a mis-grouped occurrence. **Scope:** the BOUNDED GLB export (`export_glb_streaming_bounded`, the path for models too large to hold resident) does not call `collate_refs`: it reimplements the same rep-identity grouping over a plan that deliberately keeps no vertex data, so it cannot run this reconstruction check and is NOT covered by it. Its own guard remains vertex/index counts only, exactly as before this change. On an ordinary model with no collisions the reuse ratio is unchanged. The bounded path's gap is now reported at its own seam rather than only in a source comment: `GltfStats` carries `unverified_instance_groups`, the number of distinct rep identities instanced on the count guard alone (always 0 from the in-memory assembler, non-zero from the bounded one), and `export_glb_streaming_bounded`'s doc says so.
  
  **Fix (this update):** the GLB exporter's in-memory assembler converts every visible mesh's baked vertices from IFC's native Z-up to glTF's Y-up BEFORE calling into `collate_refs`, while `InstanceMeta.transform` (and the `rel` derived from it) stays Z-up throughout; the per-occurrence node matrix is independently recomposed and Y-up-conjugated further downstream, never reading `collate_refs`'s own `rel` back. The reconstruction check above compared that Z-up `rel` directly against the already-Y-up baked vertices, which reads as a `rep_identity` collision for nearly every rotated group on a real model (a wrong-axis reconstruction lands many orders of magnitude outside tolerance, at any coordinate scale), collapsing GLB instancing from most repeated geometry down to a handful of translation-only groups. `collate_refs` gained `collate_refs_verified_in`, an opt-in variant that conjugates `rel` into a caller-supplied basis before the reconstruction check only (the `rel` returned per occurrence, and every other caller of plain `collate_refs`, is unaffected); the GLB exporter passes its Z-up to Y-up basis. A genuine `rep_identity` collision ([#3666](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3666)) still falls back to flat under the conjugated check: its residual clears the tolerance by the same orders of magnitude regardless of basis.
  
  **Review fixes (this update):** the GLB exporter's basis is `S_YUP . T(-rtc_zup)`, not `S_YUP` alone. It hands the collator `rtc = [0,0,0]` (it applies its own RTC conjugation downstream), so the `rel` the check sees is pre-RTC while the baked vertices are post-RTC, leaving a residual of `(R_rel - I) . rtc`. That is zero for a translated-only sibling and hundreds of kilometres for a rotated one on a georeferenced model, so rotated groups on such models were still falling back to flat. The check now also fails closed on a non-finite transform or position (NaN loses every comparison, so `err > tolerance` was false and a NaN passed unexamined) and on a singular `verify_basis` (which used to degrade to comparing an unconjugated `rel`, the one comparison the parameter exists to prevent). The rigid-tier exemption from both checks is decided per member rather than per group, where one rigid member switched them off for every exact-tier sibling; the GLB exporter's own instanced/flat partition is now per member too, so a MIXED group (exact-tier members alongside a rigid one) instances its exact members, verified, and flattens only the rigid ones instead of losing the shared mesh for the whole group. A refused group is also counted (`Collated::verification_rejections`) and routed differently by the WASM batch partition: the IFNS encoder emits every `flat_indices` entry as a ONE-INSTANCE template, so a refused group of N would have arrived in the shard as N singleton templates, which is the orbit-FPS regression `INSTANCE_MIN_OCCURRENCES` exists to prevent; the partition now takes those members back into its flat MeshCollection, where they are consolidated and frustum-culled as before. Finally, a failing group keeps its [#1623](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1623) don't-bake placeholders instanced against the template instead of dropping them: they carry no geometry of their own, so the flat path is not somewhere they can go, and they were vanishing from the output entirely.

- [#3446](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3446) [`c6ffda4`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/c6ffda4789099a45fafdb5fe237c33c6edd9884c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Stop a wall layer's cut geometry collapsing when the wall sits far from the project origin.
  
  `try_cut_wall_local_frame` rotates a wall into its own frame so the boolean runs at small coordinates, which is the entire reason that path exists. It then returned through `mesh_from_frame`, which computed `center + axes * local` in f64 and cast it into **absolute world f32** while leaving `Mesh::origin` at zero. The translation the frame existed to avoid was baked straight back into the coordinates, and the precision the local frame bought was spent at the last step.
  
  The damage lands on thin geometry far from the origin. On the reporter's Archicad model an `IfcBuildingElementPart` 3.3 mm thick, centred at (199, 213, 77), cut correctly to **+3.650545 m3** in its own frame and came back measuring **-94.58 m3** once the centre was folded into f32: one f32 ULP there is ~15 µm, so the cut's sliver triangles cross. The uncut mesh survives the same round trip because its triangles are coarse, which is why the defect only ever showed on cut walls and why comparing the cut against the uncut solid looked clean.
  
  `mesh_from_frame` is deleted. The behaviour it should have had already existed beside it as `rotate_mesh_from_frame`, which returns rotation-only positions with the frame centre in `Mesh::origin` and whose doc already gave the reason ("keeping positions small is what makes the cut survive f32 storage at building/national-grid magnitude"). The local-frame cut now returns through that, so there is one such transform rather than two that disagree. The relativizing branch also **composes** the inner cut's origin instead of assigning over it, which previously discarded any translation the inner cut produced.
  
  Measured on the four `IfcBuildingElementPart` layers of the reporter's wall, against ifcopenshell 0.8.2. It never applies the parent wall's `IfcRelVoidsElement` to its aggregated parts, so its numbers are the authored solids:
  
  | part | before | after | ifcopenshell |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | [#412188](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/412188) | 42.214 | 41.6701 | 41.6703 |
  | [#412196](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/412196) | 60.621 | 60.2801 | 60.2805 |
  | [#412191](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/412191) | -94.582 | 3.6506 | 3.6533 |
  | [#412193](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/412193) | 41.961 | 43.8307 | 43.8307 |
  
  All four land within 0.07%, from errors of +1.3%, +0.56%, -2688% and -4.3%.
  
  Corpus-wide the change is large. Unmatched edges fall **20348 to 17863** (-2485), triangles rise **137757 to 141799** (+4042), and the far-field host count drops **164 to 32**. The golden moves on 132 rows and was audited before blessing: none added, none removed, and every one of the 132 carries the same single cause, the `far` flag flipping 1 to 0 as a host's coordinates stop being world-absolute. 120 rows gain triangles and **none loses any**. 111 rows shed open edges; the 4 that gain them each gained far more geometry first (one goes 174 to 293 triangles), so the extra boundary is material that now survives rather than new tearing.
  
  Two golden-derived corpus ceilings move with it, stated here because a bless loosens them permanently. Closed-but-not-watertight solids go **46 to 105**: that one is the reclassification, since the reading is gated on `!far` and a host leaving far-field joins the population whose tearing is counted at all. Hosts with snap-collapsed triangles go **51 to 66**, and that is NOT a reclassification — `coll` is counted for every host regardless of `far`. All 16 hosts that gained it also gained triangles (55 to 131, 174 to 293, and so on), so the finer geometry that now survives f32 includes triangles below the 1 mm snap. Neither ceiling is new tearing, both are now permitted without a red build, and both should be ratcheted back separately.
  
  Two in-repo guards compared a cut mesh's `bounds()` against a world-absolute host without folding `Mesh::origin`, so they read two different frames once the cut stopped being world-absolute. Both now fold it on each side; both still fail when the centre is double-counted, so the guard is intact and only its frame was corrected.

- [#3863](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3863) [`3b266b9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3b266b99dac5e384c48a410df7074803b01ef20f) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Type-only fix: `ParseResponse.geometry_diagnostics` no longer points at a stale copy of `GeometryDiagnostics`. The copy had missed `schemaVersion`, `worstHosts.bbox`, `worstHosts.triangleCount` and `oversizedRefDrops`, all of which the Rust server serialises, so reading one meant a type error and a cast. A compile-time contract test now compares the client's copy with the canonical type in `@ifc-lite/geometry` field for field, so the two cannot drift again.
  
  `@ifc-lite/server-client` keeps its empty `dependencies` map: no dependency on `@ifc-lite/geometry` was added, and the runtime is untouched.
  
  `@ifc-lite/geometry` gains `GeometryDiagnostics.oversizedRefDrops` (optional) and sums it in `mergeGeometryDiagnostics`. The Rust pass has emitted the counter since [#3752](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3752); no TypeScript consumer could read it, and the merge dropped it on every fold.
  
  The client copy also declares `totalUnsupportedItems` / `unsupportedItemsByType` ahead of the canonical type so that PR [#3691](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3691), which adds those two fields in `@ifc-lite/geometry`, does not collide with this change. The contract test allowlists exactly those names and fails once [#3691](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3691) lands, which is the signal to delete the allowlist entry.
  
  The Rust producer now omits `worstHosts.firstFailureLabel`, `worstHosts.bbox` and `worstHosts.triangleCount` from the JSON when they are `None`, instead of writing an explicit `null`. The TypeScript mirrors declare them as `field?: T`, which means the key is absent; the wasm boundary already matched that because `serde_wasm_bindgen` writes `None` as `undefined`, but the server response goes through `serde_json`, which wrote `null`. A consumer guarding with `!== undefined` typechecked and then threw. Deserialisation is unchanged: a missing key and an explicit `null` both read back as `None`, so older payloads still parse.

  `materialId` was the one source id `applyFederationOffsetToMesh` left unshifted, by explicit exclusion ([#3199](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3199)/[#3525](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3525)): whether to move it depended on which id space its consumers expected, and offsetting a field a consumer indexed by local id would have been a regression rather than a fix.
  
  Census of every TS-side reader of `MeshData.materialId` (`packages/geometry/src/geometry.worker.ts`, `geometry-coordinate.ts`, the binary cache round trip in `packages/cache/src/sections/geometry.ts`, `apps/viewer/src/utils/serverMesh.ts`) found none that index a store by the raw value or otherwise depend on it being model-local — every one only copies the field through. The five style-lookup sites [#3211](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3211) found reading a material id as a representation item (`ctx.geometry_style_index` and siblings in `rust/processing/src/element.rs`) are a same-named but unrelated id: they run inside per-model Rust geometry production, before a federation offset exists at all.
  
  With no settled consumer expecting local space, leaving `materialId` unshifted beside an already-global `expressId` on the same mesh reproduced the exact "resolves to a real entity in the wrong model" defect [#2985](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2985) fixed for `geometryItemId` — worse than a miss, because it looks like an answer. `applyFederationOffsetToMesh` now shifts `materialId` the same way, with the same absence and `0`-is-not-absent guards as the other ids on the mesh.

  `point_inside` decides inside/outside by counting exact ray crossings along a segment from the query point to `p + dir * far_l`. `far_l` came from `operand_extent` of the OTHER operand, sized from that operand's own coordinates, while the query point is a centroid of THIS one. When the query point sat outside the other solid on the low-corner side of the ray direction, the segment ended INSIDE that solid: it counted the entry crossing, never reached the exit, and odd parity reported an outside point as inside. In a difference that drops the triangle, so a whole face of the host disappeared and the result came back as an open shell.
  
  Because the shell is open its signed volume is not a volume, which is how this hid: one reported case read as "1.0 m3 removed" when in truth a single 1.28 m2 face was missing and nothing had been cut at all.
  
  The segment's far endpoint is now guaranteed to clear the target's bounding box, walking out to the first escaping face plus a margin when the default endpoint would land inside. It is lengthened only in that case, which is exactly the state where the old parity was meaningless. A query whose endpoint was already outside the box keeps a byte-identical segment. That is deliberately narrower than "every previously-correct query is untouched", which is false: on a non-convex operand a point can sit inside the bounding box and outside the solid, where the old answer was already right and the segment does change. Both endpoints are outside the solid, so both parities agree. The escape face is chosen per axis by the ray direction's sign rather than assuming the direction is all-positive, and that is pinned by a test: the previous form silently depended on it, and negating one component made the endpoint land back inside the box.
  
  This is not about touching or coplanar operands, which is where the investigation started. A purely disjoint pair fails the same way. Measured against an independent analytic oracle over axis-aligned box operands, the predicate reports 454 wrong verdicts in 120,000 queries before this change and 0 after, with no new false-outside verdicts. That is the committed gate, so the figure is reproducible by reverting the change and running it.
  
  Gated by nine pinned end-to-end cases that each fail on the previous code, and by a differential of the predicate against the analytic oracle, which is the gate for the class rather than for the reported symptom.
  
  Booleans do not stop tearing altogether. A separate pre-existing family survives this fix, concentrated in overlapping and rotated operands, and is tracked on its own.

  `point_inside` (`kernel/arrangement/classify.rs`) computed `tris_aabb(tris)` — an O(N) scan of every triangle — on each call, purely to size its far ray endpoint. Every caller already holds a box that contains the same triangles: `BComponents::inside` its cached, padding-inflated per-component box; `boolean_vids_components`'s regime-2 probe the BVH's already-computed root box; `union_all` each mesh's box, now hoisted out of its per-probe loop instead of being recomputed on every other mesh's boundary triangle. `point_inside` now takes that box as a parameter instead of rescanning.
  
  Passing a box that is a superset of the triangles' true bounds (the exact box, or one padded outward) cannot change the parity verdict: the far endpoint is only ever extended to clear whichever box it is handed, and clearing a bigger box means clearing the real one too, past which there are no more triangles left to cross. All three call sites pass a genuine superset — two are the exact box, one is the exact box padded outward — so this is a pure elimination of redundant scanning, not a behavior change. Pinned by a test that checks both halves: a superset box gives a byte-identical verdict to the exact box, and (so that check is not vacuous) a box shrunk to no longer contain the mesh does flip a verdict for a deliberately constructed query.
  
  This change was not benchmarked; disk constraints in the environment it was made in prevented a reliable release-mode timing run. Treat it as a redundant-computation removal with an unmeasured effect on wall time, not as a measured speedup.

[#3695](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3695) made a malformed-record stop (a quoted string or block comment that opened and never closed) reportable on the paths that do their own scanning, but the pre-scanned path had no field to carry it, and the sharded stitch could not tell a scan that stopped from a scan that reached the end of the entities. Both arrive as `handoff === -1`, the merge loop breaks either way, and every later record is dropped with nothing said. That is the load path a large model takes in a browser.
  
  `ShardColumns` now carries `malformedStart` and `stitchShards` returns `malformedRecordCount`, attributed against the boundary each shard's records are cut at. That is the rule `oversizedIdStarts` already uses, because a shard starting inside a quoted value reports a stop the file does not contain. The flag travels on through `onEntityIndex`, `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex` and `PreScannedEntityIndex.malformedRecordCount` to `EntityScanResult.malformedRecordCount`, where the existing `onDiagnostic` message fires as it does on every other path.
  
  Absence is carried as absence, not as zero. A shard can only report a stop, never "I reached the end cleanly", so `stitchShards` returns `undefined` when no shard reported one and nothing on the way through coerces it to `0`. Otherwise "nothing reported" and "scanned clean" would be the same value to every consumer, which is the shape of the bug this fixes.
  
  No producer sets `malformedStart` yet: the Rust sharded scan has no malformed-stop offset to return until [#3699](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3699) lands, so today the field is always absent. This is the wiring, ready for that offset to arrive.

- [#3455](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3455) [`cb9dad2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/cb9dad2df38f1796ab8cb6eefe881ad795876cc9) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Thread a federated `sharedRtcOffset` through the single-threaded WASM streaming fallback, so it stops misaligning a model that lands there.
  
  `processAdaptive` picks a `sharedRtcOffset` from the earliest-loaded model so every federated model renders in one coordinate space, and threads it correctly through `processParallel` (`sendStreamStartIfReady`'s `useSharedRtc` override). `GeometryProcessor.processStreaming` accepted the same parameter but silently dropped it: `processStreamingBytes` always used the pre-pass's own per-model RTC detection instead, contradicting the very comment beside its call site ("Infrastructure models with large coordinates are always >2MB and use the parallel/streaming paths where shared RTC is properly threaded" — the single-threaded streaming path is one of those "properly threaded" paths in name only).
  
  This path is not a corner case: `processAdaptive` falls back to it for any file at or above the 2MB threshold whenever `useParallel` is false — no `SharedArrayBuffer`/`Worker` support, or `navigator.hardwareConcurrency <= 1` — which includes any deployment missing cross-origin-isolation headers. A federated model that happened to load through that fallback would compute its own RTC origin and render offset from the rest of the federation instead of aligning with it.
  
  `processStreamingBytes` now mirrors `processParallel`'s override exactly: a caller-supplied `sharedRtcOffset` replaces the pre-pass's `rtcX`/`rtcY`/`rtcZ` and forces `needsShift`, in the `processGeometryBatch` calls, the emitted `rtcOffset` event, and the coordinate handler's metadata. The synchronous `<2MB` path (`processAdaptive`'s sync branch, `collectMeshesViaPrePass`) is unaffected — it remains a documented, separate limitation.

  `try_cut_wall_local_frame` rotates a plan-rotated wall into its own axis-aligned frame and recurses into `apply_void_context_inner` to run the exact cut there. Its doc comment claimed the recursion was self-limiting because "in the frame every opening's depth is +Z" — true only when every opening reclassifies as frame-aligned. An opening that stays `NonRectangular` keeps its own depth direction re-expressed in the new frame, and that direction can itself be non-axis-aligned, so `try_cut_wall_local_frame` fires again and seeds a second frame from a different opening. With enough openings disagreeing on rotation axis this recurses without bound: a Rust stack overflow natively, and in WASM (no stack guard page — the overrun runs into linear memory instead) the reported `RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds`, which corrupts the module so every later operation traps too.
  
  `apply_void_context_inner` now takes an explicit `allow_local_frame` flag, `true` only on the outer call and forced `false` on the recursive call `try_cut_wall_local_frame` makes — capping the local-frame rotation at one per host. A later, differently-oriented opening still gets subtracted, just via the same exact/world-path kernel `NonRectangular` openings already use, instead of a second rotation.

### Minor Changes

- [#3210](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3210) [`50895fb`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/50895fb5b3d57c95e00daccc1e560f5b619c535d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Carry representation-item identity across the wasm boundary, and stop delivering material ids in the same field.
  
  `MeshData` gains two DISJOINT fields. `geometryItemId` is always the `IfcRepresentationItem` a mesh was tessellated from, so a host can drill from a rendered piece into an `IfcWindow`'s pane or frame and navigate to that entity in source. `materialId` is always the `IfcMaterial` whose layer a mesh slices. Never both — a consumer that ignores the distinction still cannot read one as the other.
  
  The router already kept each item's STEP id and it already reached the server REST payload; `MeshDataJs::from_mesh_data` did not copy it, so the browser never saw it. And for material-layered walls and slabs the same field carried the layer's `IfcMaterial` id, so following it to source landed on the wrong entity with nothing to warn the caller.
  
  `geometryClass === 3` cannot discriminate the two: it is stamped from a static material-index check made before the geometry runs, while the layered path can bail at runtime and emit representation-item submeshes under that class. The discriminator therefore lives on `SubMeshCollection`, set where the layered slabs are built.
  
  Neither field is ever `0`. `IfcMaterialLayer.Material` is optional, so an air gap reaches the mesher as `material_id 0` — that is the decoder's "no reference" sentinel, not an entity, and STEP instance names start at `[#1](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1)`. Twelve slabs of `duplex.ifc` reported `IfcMaterial #0` before this was filtered at the setter. An air-gap slab is still meshed; it simply reports no material.
  
  Both fields cross the boundary, both wasm converters carry them, the REST wire shape and `convertServerMesh` carry them, and the cache format gains them at v14 — without that, a cache-restored session silently lost the identity.
  
  BREAKING FOR THE RUST CRATE, and this changeset cannot express it. `ifc-lite-processing` is published to crates.io (`scripts/release-crates.mjs`), `MeshData` gains a public field, and `with_style_metadata(self, material_name, geometry_item_id)` becomes `with_style_metadata(self, material_name, source_id, id_is_material)` — two caller-supplied arguments to three. Both break downstream, and both are demonstrated in-repo: the added field broke the `MeshData` struct literal in `rust/export/src/usd/tests.rs`, and the new argument broke the call in `rust/processing/src/element.rs`. `scripts/sync-versions.js` derives the Cargo workspace version from the highest npm package version, so a `minor` here ships 6.0.1 → 6.1.0 and a consumer pinned to `ifc-lite-processing = "6"` breaks on `cargo update`. This was ungated when the paragraph was written and is not any more. `scripts/check-rust-semver.mjs` ([#3216](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3216)) asks `cargo-semver-checks` what bump each crate's API change requires, compares it with the bump the derived version actually carries over the crate's latest crates.io release, and fails when the version is the smaller of the two — and its lint set recognises BOTH breaks named above, a field added to a `pub` struct that callers construct literally and a changed argument count. It runs as the `Rust crate semver` lane on PRs and again before the crates.io publish. The remedy it leaves for a break like this one is `rust-major-offset.json`, which advances the Rust major without inventing an npm major.

### Patch Changes

- [#3247](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3247) [`5e236e2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/5e236e26a33bfc5e41d82ccd742351e743131293) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Quick metadata: stop severing marine facilities and common facility parts from the spatial tree.
  
  `is_quick_spatial_type_ci` in `ifc-lite-processing` decides which scanned entities become nodes of the quick-metadata spatial tree (`MetadataBootstrap.spatialTree`). It was a hand-written list of 14 keywords, and it had drifted from the schema it implements: `IFCMARINEFACILITY`, `IFCMARINEPART` and `IFCFACILITYPARTCOMMON` were absent, while their siblings `IFCBRIDGE`/`IFCBRIDGEPART`, `IFCROAD`/`IFCROADPART` and `IFCRAILWAY`/`IFCRAILWAYPART` were all present.
  
  The cost is not one missing node. Tree assembly skips an `IfcRelAggregates` edge whose parent OR child is not a known spatial node, so an unrecognised facility severs the edge above it and every edge below it: a port, quay or lock model rooted at `IfcMarineFacility` lost its whole subtree — storeys, spaces and the elements contained in them — from the bootstrap hierarchy, and any element contained directly in the facility was dropped rather than reparented.
  
  The predicate now covers exactly the rule it always meant: `IfcProject`, plus the `IfcSpatialElement` branch minus the external-spatial (air volume) sub-branch, which stays excluded. A new test derives that set from the generated `IFC_TYPES` and compares it against the predicate in both directions, with an anti-vacuity floor and a control fixture, so a future schema addition cannot slip past the list again. The predicate is also now a length-keyed dispatch: at most three case-insensitive comparisons per scanned entity instead of up to fourteen.

- [#3057](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3057) [`fdd6121`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/fdd61211e41d3e563a7604ac5e0630a9daae2de1) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Remove two advertised-but-unread option surfaces, and with them the `--quality`
  CLI flag. Both were found by the issue [#2731](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2731) audit; an earlier changeset marked
  the audit's inert *fields* `@deprecated` and deliberately left these two out,
  because each carries a behaviour decision rather than only a doc fix. This is
  that decision, taken as removal.
  
  **`DynamicBatchConfig.initialBatchSize` / `.maxBatchSize` (`geometry`,
  breaking).** The interface promised a ramp-up — small first batches for a fast
  first frame, larger ones later. No ramp-up exists.
  `getStreamingBatchSize` reads `fileSizeMB` alone (falling back to the buffer's
  own length when it is absent or zero) and returns a fixed value off a size
  ladder; the two size fields were never read on any path. `DynamicBatchConfig`
  is now `{ fileSizeMB?: number }`. Streaming behaviour is unchanged for every
  caller — the values were already ignored — but an object literal that still
  sets either field is now an excess-property error. Delete the fields; the
  resulting batch sizes are identical.
  
  **`GeometryProcessorOptions.quality` and the `GeometryQuality` enum
  (`geometry`, breaking).** The constructor discarded the value (`void
  options.quality;`) and nothing downstream consulted it, so `Fast`, `Balanced`
  and `High` selected exactly the same geometry. The field and the exported
  `GeometryQuality` enum are both gone. Callers wanting a real detail-level
  control want `tessellationQuality` (`'lowest' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' |
  'highest'`), which is honoured by the WASM pipeline.
  
  **`GenerateLod1Options.quality` (`export`, breaking).** It existed only to
  forward into the discard above. Removed.
  
  **`ifc-lite lod --quality` (`cli`, user-visible removal).** The flag accepted
  `low | medium | high | fast | balanced`, validated the value, rejected anything
  else with a non-zero exit — and then fed the result into the discarded field.
  Every accepted value produced byte-identical LOD1 output. The flag is removed
  rather than left validating into nothing: a command that still fails on
  `--quality gorgeous` while ignoring `--quality low` misleads more than an
  unknown-flag path does. Scripts passing it need the flag dropped; the generated
  GLB and metadata are unchanged.
  
  `geometry` and `export` take `major` because a public export is removed and
  optional fields disappear from published types — the repo's own API-surface
  guard puts a removed export at `major` for a package at or past 1.0. `cli` is
  `0.x` and takes `minor` for the flag removal.

- [#3161](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3161) [`063a140`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/063a1408e4c54ebc874618f8d68fe298ed3f3a6f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Name the `geometryClass` ordinals once, in a new `@ifc-lite/geometry/geometry-class` entry point.
  
  Every mesh carries a `geometryClass` tag decided in Rust and read here: 0 occurrence, 1 orphan type, 2 instanced type, 3 material-layer slice. It crosses the WASM boundary as a bare `u8`, so nothing in the type system connects the two sides — and until now the TypeScript half compared against bare integers in six files across three packages (`type-view-visibility.ts`, `kmz-exporter.ts`, `GLBExportDialog.tsx`, `ViewportContainer.tsx`, `demesh-session.ts` and `geometry/src/index.ts`). Renumbering a class meant finding all six, and missing one was silent: geometry is reclassified, not rejected, so a layered wall drops out of Model view or a type-library duplicate renders as real building geometry with nothing thrown.
  
  The new module exports the four ordinals, a `geometryClassOf(mesh)` reader carrying the `?? 0` default every call site already applied, and the two predicates the visibility rule is built from. All six call sites now go through it, with no behaviour change — the comparisons are the same, spelled differently.
  
  Both halves of the contract are now pinned. The TypeScript side asserts the ordinals are distinct and that placed / type-library partition them, and `scripts/test-wasm-contract.mjs` asserts what Rust **actually emits** across the WASM boundary — a layered-wall fixture must produce class 3 alongside class 0, so the ordinals cannot be renumbered on the Rust side without a test failing.
  
  That second half matters because the script's existing `geometryClass` read lives inside `meshFingerprint()`, comparing two code paths against each other — satisfied by any value provided both sides agree, which is a self-round-trip rather than a pin. The occurrence-class assertion is there so that a build tagging *everything* 3 would fail too, instead of passing the layer-slice check.

- [#3086](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3086) [`932f043`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/932f0439fc1625419aae3cf2d9f81a614fb2273c) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Make the 10 km "normal coordinate" ceiling one exported constant (`NORMAL_COORD_THRESHOLD_M`) instead of four unlinked copies of the literal. `CoordinateHandler`'s `NORMAL_COORD_THRESHOLD` is the validation threshold once WASM RTC has shifted the model; the viewer keyed three separate `MAX_VALID_COORD = 10000` off the same rule — `localParsingUtils.updateBoundsFromPositions`, `viewportUtils.isValidCoord` and `useGeometryStreaming.computeBounds` — two of them carrying a comment that they "match CoordinateHandler's NORMAL_COORD_THRESHOLD". Nothing enforced that: raising all three viewer copies 25x, to 250 km, left the entire viewer suite (5751 tests) green. The three now import the constant, so a change to the ceiling moves every consumer at once. Behaviour is unchanged — the value is still 10000. One agreement remains unshareable and is now pinned by a test instead: `rust/geometry/tests/issue_859_railway_renders_in_view.rs` declares its own `MAX_VALID_COORD: f32 = 10_000.0` and asserts welded railway geometry lands inside "the JS-side renderer's" threshold, so a new test fails if the TypeScript side moves away from 10 km without that fixture being updated too.

### Patch Changes

- [#2975](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2975) [`8571d70`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8571d70270d072170fc4e204e8b0d11a424d2330) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Seven public option fields that nothing reads are now marked `@deprecated`,
  with JSDoc that says what actually happens instead of what the old comment
  promised. No behaviour changes and no export is removed or renamed — the
  values were already ignored at runtime; only the type-level documentation
  changes, so editors now warn at the point a caller sets one.
  
  - `SVGExportOptions.units` (`drawing-2d`) — `export()` never destructures it;
    the exporter emits no dimension annotations and always sizes the sheet in
    millimetres.
  - `OpeningFilterOptions.keepBoundarySegments` (`drawing-2d`) — merged into the
    filter's options object but never consulted; `tolerance` is the only field
    that governs how segments near an opening edge are treated.
  - `DoorSymbolConfig.showThreshold` (`drawing-2d`) — no threshold-rendering code
    exists, so `true` and `false` produce identical geometry.
  - `SnapOptions.snapRadius` (`renderer`) — documented as a world-units snap
    distance, but every proximity check reads `screenSnapRadius` (pixels).
    Snapping is screen-space and zoom-dependent; set `screenSnapRadius` instead.
  - `SectionPlaneRenderOptions.flipped` (`renderer`) — the gizmo renderer never
    reads it. The GPU clip plane flips correctly through separate state, so
    cutting behaviour is unaffected; only the gizmo option is inert.
  - `RenderOptions.enableDepthTest` (`renderer`) — dead on both ends: nothing
    sets it and nothing reads it. Depth comparison is fixed per pipeline at
    construction time and is not configurable through `RenderOptions`.
  - `StreamingOptions.onMetadataBootstrap` (`geometry`) — an unfinished stub. Its
    siblings `onBatch`, `onColorUpdate`, `onComplete` and `onError` are all
    dispatched by the bridge; this one never is, so a callback passed here is
    never called.
  
  Deprecating rather than deleting is deliberate: removing an optional field an
  embedder already passes converts a silent no-op into a TypeScript compile
  error, which is a worse first contact with the problem than a deprecation
  warning that explains it. Removal is left as a separate, explicitly versioned
  decision. See issue [#2731](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2731) for the full audit; the findings that carry a
  behaviour decision (the streaming batch ramp-up, `GeometryQuality`, and the
  scale-bar / north-arrow renderer divergence) are deliberately untouched here.

- [#2958](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2958) [`74a55a9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/74a55a999117b4e21aa58d0435473073f35c1e81) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - A Boolean/CSG operand cycle no longer aborts the process.
  `IfcCsgSolid.TreeRootExpression` may be an `IfcBooleanResult` whose operands
  may in turn be `IfcCsgSolid`, so the two recurse into each other over
  file-supplied references. The `IfcCsgSolid` arm built a fresh
  `BooleanClippingProcessor`, resetting both the depth counter and the cycle
  guard, so three entities were enough to recurse forever with depth never
  passing 1. The result was `fatal runtime error: stack overflow, aborting` —
  an abort, not a catchable panic, so nothing downstream could report it. Both
  entity types appear in the Body representations of ordinary files, so an
  exporter bug is enough to trigger it.
  
  A path-scoped visited set is now threaded through the whole operand path,
  inserted on the way in and removed on the way out, so an operand legitimately
  reached from two branches of an acyclic tree is still processed both times.
  Its length is the current nesting depth, which also bounds chain length:
  `MAX_OPERAND_PATH_NODES = 64`. That sits well clear of `MAX_BOOLEAN_DEPTH`
  (10), so it cannot make that cap's job harder. The 42-node `DIFFERENCE` chains
  real exporters produce are FirstOperand spine nodes, walked iteratively, and
  never reach this guard.
  
  Unlike the sibling fixes in this series, this one reports: hitting either bound
  returns a catchable geometry error naming the entity — `Cyclic boolean/CSG
  operand reference at #N` or `Boolean/CSG operand chain exceeds 64 nested nodes
  at #N`. The offending element is dropped with that error; the rest of the file
  loads.

- [#2958](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2958) [`74a55a9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/74a55a999117b4e21aa58d0435473073f35c1e81) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Layer slicing no longer aborts the process on a self-referential
  `IfcBooleanResult`. `item_has_identity_position` chased
  `IfcBooleanResult.FirstOperand` recursively, and that reference comes from the
  file, so a single entity referring to itself
  (`[#10](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/10)=IFCBOOLEANRESULT(.DIFFERENCE.,[#10](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/10),[#20](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/20))`) overflowed the stack. A Rust
  stack overflow aborts the process rather than raising a catchable panic, so no
  caller could turn it into a load error — the whole load died on raw uploaded
  bytes.
  
  The chase is now an iterative walk with a visited set that stops at the first
  repeated node. There is deliberately no length cap: Revit exports chains up to
  42 `DIFFERENCE` nodes deep, and a cap would drop layer slicing on files that
  render correctly today.
  
  Note what happens at the guard, because nothing catchable surfaces. On a
  repeat the probe returns `false`, so `element_is_single_unshifted_item` returns
  `false` and the element renders as a single un-sliced mesh with one material
  instead of per-layer sub-meshes. That is a visible loss of layer materials for
  the offending element. It is not unreported: the router records a
  `skip:not-single-unshifted-item` diagnostic, which the viewer's batch path
  drains into a `console.warn` naming the element id and that reason. But a
  console warning is not an error a caller can handle, so no downstream code can
  react to it. The rest of the file loads normally.

- [#2958](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2958) [`74a55a9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/74a55a999117b4e21aa58d0435473073f35c1e81) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - A self-referential `IfcTrimmedCurve` no longer aborts the process.
  `sample_curve_polyline` followed `IfcTrimmedCurve.BasisCurve` recursively, and
  that reference comes from the file, so one entity naming itself as its own
  basis overflowed the stack — an abort rather than a catchable panic, so nothing
  downstream could turn it into a load error. The sampler is reached by any
  `IfcAdvancedBrep` with a composite edge curve and by the surface-of-revolution
  generator profile, so ordinary geometry paths were exposed.
  
  Two guards now, because they bound different things: a visited set stops cycles
  (and any fan-out a later change introduces — the single tail call here has none
  today, but nothing enforces that), and `MAX_BASIS_CURVE_DEPTH = 32` stops a
  long acyclic chain, where every id is distinct so the set never fires and the
  recursion aborts on stack depth alone. Real trimming nests one or two levels.
  
  At either bound the sampler returns an empty polyline rather than an error, so
  the offending curve contributes no points and the edge or face built from it is
  missing from the mesh. Legitimate trimmed-on-trimmed chains ending at a real
  curve are still sampled in full.

- [#2958](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2958) [`74a55a9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/74a55a999117b4e21aa58d0435473073f35c1e81) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Composite-curve profiles on `IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion` produce geometry
  again, and can no longer abort the process.
  
  The silent half: `extract_composite_curve_points` handed each segment's
  `ParentCurve` id to the profile dispatcher, which reads attribute 2 as "the
  profile's curve". An `IfcPolyline` has no attribute 2, so every segment
  errored, the caller swallowed it, and the function returned an empty point set
  as `Ok` — indistinguishable from a legitimately empty profile. Every
  `IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion` with a composite-curve profile lost its geometry
  this way. Curve dispatch is now separate from profile dispatch, so a
  `ParentCurve` is sampled as the curve it is. Two further defects that only
  became observable once points started flowing are fixed with it:
  `IfcCompositeCurveSegment.SameSense = .F.` now reverses the segment as the
  schema requires, and the joint point between segments is dropped only when it
  actually coincides, so a `.DISCONTINUOUS.` joint or a real gap keeps the point
  it used to lose.
  
  The fatal half: a composite curve whose segment's `ParentCurve` is that same
  composite curve re-entered the sampler and overflowed the stack — an abort, not
  a catchable panic. Three bounds now travel together, each blind to what the
  others catch: a path-scoped visited set for cycles, a nesting cap of 32 for a
  long acyclic chain where every insert succeeds, and a budget of 100,000 curve
  visits for an acyclic DAG that doubles its work per level while nothing is
  cyclic and nothing exceeds the depth cap.
  
  The two kinds of bound behave differently, deliberately. A cycle or the depth
  cap yields no points for that nested curve and reports nothing. Budget
  exhaustion returns a catchable error (`Curve traversal exceeded 100000 nested
  curves`) rather than a truncated point list, because a short profile returned
  as if it were complete is a wrong shape; the element is dropped instead.

- [#2990](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2990) [`f76c805`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f76c80511dce5ffc1756365b786042c4bc64808d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix: `exportGlbFromMeshes` (the viewer's from-meshes GLB path, e.g. exporting
  the current selection) now fails closed with `NO_RENDER_GEOMETRY` when the
  visible mesh set is empty, instead of returning a "successful" GLB.
  
  That GLB was structurally invalid per the glTF 2.0 schema: `accessors`,
  `bufferViews`, `meshes` and `nodes` were emitted as empty arrays (the schema
  requires `minItems: 1` on each when present) and the single buffer's
  `byteLength` was `0` (schema `minimum: 1`) — confirmed against the reference
  `gltf-validator`. A consumer that enforces the schema (many glTF tools do)
  rejected the file outright.
  
  `exportGlb` (the from-bytes path) already guarded this case
  (`NO_RENDER_GEOMETRY`, [#1438](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1438)/[#1516](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1516)); `exportGlbFromMeshes` was the one
  sibling entry point that did not, and it is reachable directly from the
  viewer whenever a caller's filtered mesh list — or a filtered list where
  every mesh fails the minimum-geometry check (fewer than 3 vertices, or no
  indices) — comes back empty.

- [#2969](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2969) [`754837b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/754837b066172dad8afcdf1a0104f1a021b5f6e5) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Raise the mesh path's `IfcLocalPlacement.PlacementRelTo` depth cap from 32 to 100, matching the 2D drawing path, and make the two share one constant (`ifc_lite_core::limits::MAX_PLACEMENT_DEPTH`). The two walks follow the same attribute of the same entity and both return the IDENTITY on exceeding their cap, so an element on a 33-to-101-link placement chain was composed in full by the 2D profile extractor and flattened by the router — the same element drawn in two different places, with no error from either side. The cap's stated basis for 32 ("keep low for WASM — each frame uses ~2KB+ of stack") does not hold against the linked stack budget: every wasm bundle is built with `-zstack-size=8388608`, and the walk's frames measure ~1KB in an unoptimised native build, so the deeper cap's worst case is around 1% of the 8MiB stack; `PlacementRelTo` is a single reference, so the walk has fan-out 1 and costs O(depth). Chains beyond the cap are still truncated silently, exactly as before — only the depth at which that happens changes, and it now happens at the same depth on both paths. No file in the `tests/models` corpus has a chain deeper than 7 links, so no fixture's geometry moves. New tests pin each site's cap to the shared constant and require both walks to return the same transform for a chain past it.

- [#3043](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3043) [`2273a73`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/2273a73127d03ec36d667544da6237479737881a) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Stop the placement-transform memo from caching a depth-truncated result. The router's `PlacementRelTo` walk returns the identity for a node above `MAX_PLACEMENT_DEPTH`, so the node sitting AT the cap composed `identity * local` — a partial chain — and wrote it to the per-decoder memo, as did every node above it. A later query for one of those placements was served that partial value instead of walking its own chain, which fits the cap comfortably. On a 120-link chain the node at the cap resolved to X = 21 from a fresh decoder and X = 1 from one that had resolved the leaf first: the same placement, the same file, two positions, decided by traversal order, with the wrong answer sticky. The walk now carries a `truncated` flag that propagates upward through the `IfcLocalPlacement`, `IfcLinearPlacement` and `IfcGridPlacement` branches, and only untruncated results are memoised; the truncated transform is still returned to its caller, exactly as before, so nothing that resolves within the cap changes. Recording the truncation in the entry was the alternative the issue offered: it was not taken because a truncated entry is not servable to anyone — what it composed depends on the depth the walk was entered at, not on the placement id — so a reader would have to recompute anyway, and the memo's value type is hoisted across workers through the public `take/set_placement_transform_cache` API. No corpus file has a chain deeper than 7 links against a cap of 100, so no fixture's geometry moves. The comment claiming a truncated result could never reach a cache write is gone; it was false when written.
  
  The memo lookup now runs BEFORE the depth guard rather than after it. The guard was refusing a node whose complete transform was already in the memo, throwing that value away and handing back a shorter chain in its place: on a 109-placement chain, warming the decoder at the node the walk reaches at `MAX_PLACEMENT_DEPTH + 1` left the leaf still reporting the truncated 101 links, when the cached value was in hand and would have carried it to the full 109. A memo hit returns instead of recursing, so it replaces the rejected frame rather than adding one and costs no stack — an atomic max-depth probe over that chain measures the same maximum recursion depth, 101, cold and warm. This does not make over-cap chains order-independent in general: a warm ancestor lets a walk compose past the cap, so the same leaf can legitimately report 101 or 109 depending on what was resolved first, and both are legal under a cap that stops rather than one that promises an answer. What is excluded is the narrower and worse case — a short answer served from the memo as though it were whole.

### Patch Changes

- [#2923](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2923) [`c688a12`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/c688a1272ec72d575e8ecf78072e0a0084b517ca) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `intersection_solid`'s trust gate now projects each operand's extent onto the same axis the overlap thickness is measured along, instead of sizing the required band from the max coordinate magnitude over all three axes. An operand pair offset far from the origin on an axis the measured thickness never touches no longer inflates the trust band and wrongly withholds a genuine near-origin-scale overlap as `BelowKernelResolution`.

- [#2905](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2905) [`989ee2c`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/989ee2c4e396575529488c17b73e1a884e4e8b9d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered` (lofted extrusion) hole side walls shading with inverted normals. `create_lofted_side_walls` applied a `winding_sign` correction (matching `create_side_walls`'s convention, which already leaves a CW-authored hole's walls facing into the solid, away from the void) and then flipped the normal a second time for `is_hole`, undoing that and pointing hole side walls into the void instead of into the solid — any tapered element with an opening (a tapered wall or column with a window/duct penetration) would shade its opening reveal inside-out. Removed the redundant second flip; a new regression test compares the untapered (`start == end`) lofted case directly against uniform `extrude_profile`'s hole normal and requires them to agree.

- [#2720](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2720) [`1cda2d0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/1cda2d04dc66542892dd0181768c027b3d1b4e6f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Harden three Rust fixtures that could not observe the property they asserted.
  
  Test-only; no production code changed. Each of the three was verified by
  mutating production, confirming the old fixture still passed, and confirming
  the new one fails.
  
  - `rust/processing/src/simplify_session_tests.rs` — the only `y_up: true` test
    passed `origin: [0.0; 3]`, and `yup_to_zup` of zero is zero, so
    `simplify_element`'s `yup_to_zup(rec.origin)` branch was unobservable:
    replacing it with `let origin = rec.origin;` kept the crate green. The
    record now carries a Z-up origin of (1, 2, 3), fed in as the boundary's Y-up
    swap, and both the local and render extents are pinned at min and max.
  
  - `rust/ffi/src/tests.rs` — `normalize_to_site_local`'s guard skips the shift
    only when all three site-translation components are inside
    `LARGE_COORD_THRESHOLD`, but the only fixture exercising it put all three
    past 1 km, so rewriting `&&` as `||` still shifted. The fixture now uses a
    realistic georeferenced placement (large easting and northing, a 2 m
    elevation), and a second test brackets the constant itself, which the
    previous 1.0-vs-123456.0 pair left free anywhere in between.
  
  - `rust/geometry/src/router/voids/bool2d_path_tests.rs` — `hm_inv()` returned
    the identity and was the argument to every `opening_solid_footprint` call in
    the crate, so production's `let to_host = hm_inv * op.m;` was
    indistinguishable from `let to_host = op.m;`. The host is now placed at
    (3, -2, 5) rotated about Z, `hm_inv()` is its real inverse, and opening
    placements are given in world space as `host_m() * (host-local placement)`.
  
  Scope: these three fixtures only. The sweep that found them did not cover most

  leaks: a `Worker` is spawned, a fallible step runs right after it (a
  `postMessage` structured-clone), and the failure path had no handle to the
  worker it had already created.
  
  `packages/geometry/src/geometry-parallel.ts`: the process-worker pool's
  init loop (spawn, then `postMessage({type:'init', ...})` and five more
  `set-*` messages per worker) ran before the function's own try/finally, so
  a `postMessage` throw partway through the loop (a `wasmModule`
  structured-clone failure is the realistic trigger — the same class of
  error `dispatchJobsChunkInternal` already guards against) left every
  worker spawned so far un-terminated; the finally that owns teardown for
  the rest of the pipeline never saw the throw. The loop now has its own
  try/catch that terminates every worker pushed to `workers` so far before
  rethrowing.
  
  `packages/parser/src/scan-worker-inline.ts`: `scanEntitiesInWorker`
  declared its `Worker` with `const` inside the try that also calls
  `postMessage`, so the catch block — which only had `reject(err)` — could
  not reach it if `postMessage` threw after construction (a detached-buffer
  or memory-pressure clone failure). The `worker` binding now lives outside
  the try so the catch can terminate it before rejecting.

  The plane offset used to gate the weld was computed as `n·v` at the facet's raw world-frame vertex. A per-facet normal-direction error of the same tiny scale the weld already exists to correct — independent f32 re-quantisation between adjacent faces — was amplified by the vertex's absolute position magnitude, turning a sub-tolerance offset gap into one that blew through `MAX_OFFSET_JITTER`. Only coordinates beyond 10,000 m trigger recentring upstream, so this left ordinary site coordinates fully exposed: authored-coplanar facets stayed fragmented, reintroducing the far-corner sliver fan the weld was written to remove ([#1007](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1007), host [#1112](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1112)).

  The fix anchors the normal and offset computation to a local frame: subtract a whole-mesh anchor before the plane math and add it back before returning positions, so the dot product multiplies a mesh-extent magnitude instead of the world-frame position. The anchor is the bounding-box MINIMUM CORNER taken over all canonical vertices, which makes it a function of the vertex set rather than of visit order, so a different triangulation cannot change the weld. Anchoring engages only when the mesh's maximum absolute raw coordinate reaches ANCHOR_ENGAGE_METERS (100 m); meshes below that keep the pre-anchor formulation unchanged. Existing tolerances (`MAX_OFFSET_JITTER`, `MAX_VERTEX_MOVE`, `POSITION_DEDUP_GRID`) are unchanged. Near-origin output is bit-identical (verified against `mesh_welding_calibration.rs`'s duplex M_Fixed window fixture, hash-for-hash).

  Two separate, pre-existing limitations at these magnitudes are not addressed here and are reported, not silently patched: `POSITION_DEDUP_GRID` (1e-4 m) becomes finer than `f32`'s own storage ULP beyond roughly 840 m, so Step 1's vertex dedup can miss genuinely-coincident corners; and the anchoring fix bounds the residual offset gap to the anchor-to-cluster distance (mesh scale) rather than fully to zero, for a host whose bounding-box corner sits far from the cluster being welded.

  `ifc_angle_to_kml_heading` (`rust/export/src/kmz.rs`) converted the `IfcMapConversion` X-axis (grid-north) into a KML `<Model><Orientation><heading>` by computing the axis's compass **bearing** (`90 - angle_from_east_ccw`, clockwise from north). KML's `heading` is not a bearing: it's a clockwise **rotation** applied to a model whose local X-axis starts pointing east (heading `0`), so a model whose X-axis should point at true bearing `B` needs `heading = B - 90`, not `B`. Every KMZ export with a rotated `IfcMapConversion` X-axis (i.e. every model whose grid north differs from true north) was placed 90° off in Google Earth.

  Fix: `heading = -angle_from_east_ccw` (mod 360), equivalently `(360 - angle_from_east_ccw) mod 360`, instead of `90 - angle_from_east_ccw`. A negative-zero result (X-axis exactly on east, angle `0`) is folded back to `+0.0` so it doesn't render as `<heading>-0</heading>`.

  No KMZ/KML importer exists anywhere in this repo, so there was no compensating inverse conversion — previously-exported KMZ files with a non-identity grid-north axis are genuinely off by 90° in Google Earth and should be re-exported.

  A follow-up to the wasm-trap source-location attribution: the Rust panic hook stashes
  `{ location, at }` on whichever realm's JS global it runs in, but a panic inside a geometry
  process worker or the parser worker left that stash stranded in the worker's own realm, invisible
  to the main thread's `attachWasmPanicLocation` gate — so "Geometry worker error: unreachable" (and
  the equivalent parser-worker error) still arrived without a location.

  Both workers now read + consume their own realm's stash on the `{type:'error'}` message they post
  back, and the main-thread pools (`geometry-parallel.ts`'s process-worker pool AND its streaming
  pre-pass worker, `worker-parser.ts`) re-plant it on the main realm's global before the load error
  propagates — so the existing consume-once, TTL-guarded attachment gate in the viewer picks a worker
  trap up exactly as it would a main-thread one. The re-plant only happens when the accompanying error
  message itself looks wasm-trap-shaped, so a stash forwarded alongside an ordinary, non-trap worker
  error (the worker always forwards whatever it has, regardless of the error that triggered it) can't
  sit on the main realm's global and mislabel an unrelated later trap. Location only, never the panic
  message, matching the existing privacy contract.

  The boundary chain walk dropped a dead-ended chain (no continuation back to
  its start) and could also fold an unclosed chain into an already-visited
  vertex, treating it as if it were a closed loop. Neither case affected
  `outer_count`/`outer_filled`, the two counters the return value was computed
  from, so an open edge from a dead-ended or merged chain never showed up in
  the verdict.

  On a non-watertight host — a routine input to
  `BooleanClippingProcessor::clip_mesh_with_half_space` — this could report
  `capped: true` with open boundary edges still present, contradicting the
  function's own contract ("a boundary that does not close bails") and the
  per-piece "was the cut closed" signal [#1810](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1810) zone splitting depends on for a
  trustworthy quoted volume.

  The walk now tracks whether any chain failed to close, and that flag is
  ANDed into the returned verdict alongside the existing counters.

  The merge-into-an-already-visited-vertex arm had a second bug beyond the
  verdict: it set the flag and `break`, matching the code comment ("do NOT
  push it as if it were a closed loop"), but never cleared the partial walk
  first, so the un-closed chain was still `>= 3` vertices long and got pushed
  into `loops`, triangulated, and appended to the mesh — garbage cap geometry
  landing in the output even on a call that correctly reported
  `capped: false`. The merge arm now clears the partial walk before breaking,
  matching its sibling dead-end arm.

  Scope note: `capped` only measures whether the ON-PLANE cut section closed.
  A host with pre-existing OPEN boundary edges off the cut plane still reports
  `capped: true` — the boundary walk is filtered to on-plane endpoints by
  design, so it never re-examines unrelated openness elsewhere on the mesh.

  Also adds `kernel::mesh_volume`, a public, closedness-UNGATED divergence-
  theorem volume reading for a `Mesh` (delegates to the crate's one
  divergence-sum implementation, `signed_volume6`). It is a raw primitive, not
  a replacement for `geom_closure::GeometryHasher::volume` — that one stays
  the crate's closedness-gated, per-entity volume and requires the hasher's
  accumulated state; `mesh_volume` is for a bare `Mesh` (e.g. a future
  zone-split piece) that never went through it. Callers of `mesh_volume` must
  establish closedness themselves first; see its doc for the exact
  translation-stability guarantee (stable up to a documented quantization
  noise floor, not exact).

  `CoordinateHandler.processMeshes` — the path behind the synchronous `GeometryProcessor.process()` — returned its `CoordinateInfo` without the wasm metadata that `setWasmMetadata` had recorded, while the incremental/streaming path attached it. For a model whose placement the wasm pre-pass re-based (coordinates >10 km from the origin, e.g. a Vectorworks export with the IfcSite at absolute EPSG:25833 map coordinates, issue [#2526](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2526)), every sync-path consumer then read the re-based bounds as if they were absolute: the site offset — including its elevation — silently vanished from georeferencing math. All `processMeshes` returns (empty, no-shift, and shifted) now attach the same metadata the incremental path reports, via one shared helper.

  - `detect_schema` now scans the whole HEADER section instead of only the first 4096 bytes, so a long earlier header field (e.g. a lengthy `FILE_DESCRIPTION`) no longer pushes `FILE_SCHEMA` out of range and silently defaults the output to IFC4.
  - The `FILE_SCHEMA` search — and the HEADER-section boundary scan that bounds it — are now quote-aware, so a header string value that happens to contain the literal text `FILE_SCHEMA` or `ENDSEC;` is no longer mistaken for the real entry.
  - `detect_schema` un-doubles a `\\` in the detected label before it is re-escaped on write, so a schema label carrying a literal `\` (synthetic, but reachable through the same code path as the labels above) round-trips instead of compounding.
  - `exportMerged`'s `#`-reference rewriter now copies non-`#`-reference bytes through unchanged instead of widening each byte to a `char`, which corrupted every non-ASCII (UTF-8 multi-byte) character in a merged model's string literals.
  - `exportMerged`'s header-string escaping now maps every ASCII control byte (not just `\n`/`\r`/`\t`) to a space, matching the STEP exporter and ISO 10303-21's basic graphic range.

  `merged.rs`'s private forks of `detect_schema` and `escape` are removed; it now shares the hardened primitives in `step_text.rs` with the STEP exporter.

### Minor Changes

- [#1344](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1344) [`63496ec`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/63496ec0ae63c54c3bcbc5ecaec537877dc48831) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add DFJSON (Dragonfly) energy-model export alongside HBJSON. Each `IfcSpace` becomes an extruded `Room2D` (floor polygon + floor-to-ceiling height) grouped into stories — the simpler Ladybug Tools target for mostly-vertical-wall models. Surfaces:

  - `GeometryProcessor.exportDfjson(buffer, name)` (`@ifc-lite/geometry`)
  - `bim.export.dfjson({ name, filename })` + `ExportDfjsonOptions` (`@ifc-lite/sdk`)
  - `ifc-lite export <file> --format dfjson` (`@ifc-lite/cli`)

  The Rust source of truth is `ifc-lite-export::export_dfjson`, reusing the same analytic floor-footprint extraction as HBJSON, so the two exports agree on where a footprint lands.

  They do not cover the same set of spaces, by design: each builder applies its own admissibility rules downstream of that shared extraction. A `Room2D` is a floor polygon swept straight up, so DFJSON reports a space as `skipped` when it cannot be represented that way — a zero-height extrusion, an extrusion that leans more than ~2° off vertical, or a sloped floor ring — where HBJSON still emits a solid. Emitting those as vertical plates anyway would land the floor correctly and every wall wrongly, with nothing in the stats to say so. Conversely DFJSON keeps a space that HBJSON's watertightness gate rejects, since a 2D plate has nothing to fail. On real models that runs in both directions — 19 HBJSON rooms vs 17 DFJSON on one file, 46 vs 47 on another.

  A model carrying duplicated `IfcSpace` geometry (Revit does this) runs the same `dedupe_colliding` pass HBJSON uses, so overlapping plates drop the same copies rather than double-counting floor area.

  The `Building` → `Story` → `Room2D` nesting comes from the file's own `IfcBuilding` / `IfcBuildingStorey` / `IfcSpace` containment, and both carry their IFC `Name` into `display_name` — the point of the format for an IFC-shaped model, and the thing HBJSON's flat `rooms` array drops. Grouping by floor elevation instead would only approximate the partition the file already states: on `Office_A_20110811.ifc` a 1 m elevation band splits the model's two populated storeys into three stories. That heuristic survives as the fallback for spaces the file places nowhere, and for models that declare no spatial structure at all.

  Known v1 limitation: `Room2D.display_name` is still `R{expressId}` rather than the `IfcSpace` `Name` — the same as HBJSON's rooms today, so the two stay in step.

  Both energy exports apply the mutation view, so entities authored in-session (drawn spaces, in particular) are visible to the analytic exporter rather than silently missing — the DFJSON half of [#1908](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1908). Regeneration through `StepExporter` happens only when the overlay actually carries edits (`hasPendingChanges()`), so an unedited model still hands its retained source bytes straight to the exporter. The gate, the byte resolution and the WASM handle lifecycle are shared between the two formats rather than written twice.

### Patch Changes

- [#2391](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2391) [`a8da187`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a8da187054ffb2992974e8592bbdd13a559ff8cd) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix a WASM handle leak in `IfcLiteBridge.init()`: the `IfcAPI` handle is constructed at `new IfcAPI()` and then four cached settings (`applyMergeLayers`, `applyComputeGeometryHashes`, `applyTessellationQuality`, `applySkipSmallCuts`) are replayed onto it before `init()` marks itself ready. If any of those four throws, the `catch` block called `reset()`, which only nulled the JS reference — it never called `free()` on the handle that had just been built, so the wasm-bindgen pointer leaked for the life of the document (no later `dispose()` can reach a `null` handle).

  `init()`'s failure path now best-effort frees the handle before dropping the reference, on both the ordinary-error and the fatal WASM-runtime-trap branches — the same "drop (and free) the handle, propagate the error unchanged" contract every other WASM-calling method in this file already follows via `recordWasmRuntimeTrap`. The free is wrapped so a secondary failure from `free()` itself (the runtime can re-trap while freeing) can never replace or mask the original `init()` error reaching the caller.

  Not changed: what happens when the WASM trap occurs before the handle exists (during module instantiation) — there is nothing to free in that case, and the fatal error/reload-advisory behavior for that path is unchanged.

- [#2391](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2391) [`a8da187`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a8da187054ffb2992974e8592bbdd13a559ff8cd) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `IfcLiteBridge.disposeBestEffort()`'s recovery `catch` — reached when `free()` itself throws or traps while cleaning up after a primary WASM failure — silently dropped the secondary error, unlike every other catch site in `ifc-lite-bridge.ts`, which reports what it recovered from via `log.error`. It now does the same, so a `free()` failure during recovery leaves a trace instead of vanishing.

  This is diagnostics only: `reset()` still runs unconditionally and `disposeBestEffort()` still never throws, so the original error the caller is already unwinding with (including the fatal `isWasmRuntimeError` path in `init()`) is unaffected — the `log.error` call is itself wrapped so a throwing logger cannot defeat that guarantee.

ISO 10303-21 requires both `'` and `\` to be doubled in a string literal; only the apostrophe was, so the FILE_SCHEMA label was written as an under-escaped, non-conformant literal whenever it contained a `\`. `exportMerged`'s `schema` parameter is the only header field the wasm binding exposes to JS callers — the underlying `MergedOptions` also lets `description` and `application` be overridden, but the wasm binding always passes their fixed, special-character-free defaults — so this only changes output for schema labels containing `'` or `\`. Strings with no `'` or `\` are emitted byte-identically, as before.

- [#2405](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2405) [`086e5dd`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/086e5ddab3e72428fd262f0033598df5b714e328) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `exportStep` now doubles a literal reverse solidus (`\`) inside STEP string literals, matching the apostrophe doubling it already did. ISO 10303-21 requires both `'` and `\` to be doubled in a string literal; only the apostrophe was, so a property or pset name containing a Windows path or a regex (e.g. `C:\temp`, `Pset_MyProps\Sub`) was written as an under-escaped, non-conformant literal. Values that are already STEP-serialized (`AttrMutation.value` / `PropMutation.value`) are untouched — only the property/pset name and header fields that flow through this exporter's own `escape()` are affected. Strings with no `'` or `\` are emitted byte-identically, as before.

  Also closes a related gap in the same `escape()` function: it already mapped `\n`, `\r`, and `\t` to a space, but left every other ASCII control character (NUL, vertical tab, unit separator, DEL, etc.) unchanged. ISO 10303-21 restricts a string literal's plain-text bytes to the basic graphic range 32-126, so those bytes were not legal literal content — a property or pset name containing one of them was written as a raw, non-conformant control byte instead of the space every other control character already gets. All ASCII control characters (the C0 range and DEL) now map to a space, consistently.

- [#2405](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2405) [`086e5dd`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/086e5ddab3e72428fd262f0033598df5b714e328) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `exportStep`'s source-schema detection (`detect_schema`) used to scan only the first 4096 bytes of a STEP file looking for `FILE_SCHEMA`. A real HEADER section can push `FILE_SCHEMA` past that fixed cutoff when an earlier header field (e.g. a long `FILE_DESCRIPTION`) carries enough text, silently falling back to the `IFC4` default and applying the wrong schema conversion to the export. Schema detection now scans through the HEADER section's closing `ENDSEC;` instead of a fixed byte budget.

- [#2405](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2405) [`086e5dd`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/086e5ddab3e72428fd262f0033598df5b714e328) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `exportStep`'s source-schema detection (`detect_schema`) located the HEADER section's closing `ENDSEC;` and the `FILE_SCHEMA` entry with a raw byte search that did not know about STEP string literals. A header field whose string value happened to contain the literal text `ENDSEC;` or `FILE_SCHEMA` (e.g. inside a `FILE_DESCRIPTION`) could therefore produce a false match and detect the wrong schema. The scan is now quote-aware, tracking whether it is inside a single-quoted string (including the `''`-doubled-apostrophe escape) so text inside a string value can no longer be mistaken for header structure.

  `decodePackedGeometryCacheShard` (the binary `packed-cache-shard` reader used by the desktop native cache path) and `convertPackedNativeBatch` (the Tauri-native packed-mesh-array conversion) both sliced each mesh's vertex/normal/index data out of a shared pool via `TypedArray.subarray(offset, offset + length)` with no check that `offset + length` stayed inside the pool. `subarray` saturates rather than throwing on an out-of-range end, so a mesh whose declared length ran past its pool silently received truncated data — or, when the overrun reached into a neighbouring mesh's range, silently absorbed that mesh's vertices instead. Either way the result renders as plausible-looking geometry with no error anywhere on the read path. The sibling instanced-shard decoder (`packed-instanced-decoder.ts`) already carried this exact guard; these two were missing it.

  `decodePackedGeometryCacheShard` also now rejects a payload truncated below the header size or inside the data section, matching the truncation check the instanced decoder already had.

  `convertPackedNativeBatch` additionally requires each offset and length to be a non-negative integer, which the binary decoder gets for free: its values come from `getUint32`, while these arrive as plain JS numbers on an IPC payload. An upper-bound comparison alone does not cover that — `NaN + length > poolLength` is false, so a NaN offset would pass and `subarray(NaN, NaN)` returns an empty view, reporting a successfully converted mesh that carries no geometry at all; a negative offset likewise passes and makes `subarray` count from the end of the pool.

  No change to well-formed input; all of these are purely defensive checks on malformed/truncated/corrupted data.

- [#2052](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2052) [`d44b6c1`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d44b6c1710ee86596e96e0204785d2bf7c0940a9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add OpenUSD ASCII (`.usda`) export — a real Z-up USD stage, distinct from the existing IFCX (USD-flavored JSON) export.

  The stage mirrors the IFC spatial hierarchy as `Xform` prims with `UsdGeomMesh` geometry, `UsdPreviewSurface` materials, and IFC metadata (`ifc:class`, `ifc:GlobalId`, property/quantity sets) as custom attributes; it opens in usdview / Blender / Omniverse. Geometry outside the spatial tree (opening elements, type-product meshes) is placed under a synthetic `Unassigned` prim rather than dropped, and each mesh carries its placement as a `double3 xformOp:translate` so georeferenced models keep full precision.

  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: `GeometryProcessor.exportUsd(bytes)` (and `IfcLiteBridge.exportUsd`) returning the `.usda` bytes.
  - `@ifc-lite/cli`: `ifc-lite export --format usd` (whole-model; entity filters do not apply).
  - `@ifc-lite/mcp`: the `export_usd` tool.

### Patch Changes

- [#2082](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2082) [`2c47277`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/2c47277ee6dfbd9779eb4948d1f2e7b0ea61d00e) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Stop the native geometry streaming loop from hanging on — or silently completing after — a failed stream, and report the failures the geometry package used to swallow.

  Auditing the silent `catch {}` blocks in `packages/geometry` surfaced two real defects in the native (Tauri desktop) streaming drain loop, which existed in two near-identical copies — `streamNativeGeometry` and an inline one in `GeometryProcessor.processStreaming`, only the first of which had tests. The two are now a single loop, so both fixes and their tests apply to every native route:

  - **A stream failure that never reached `onError` hung the load forever.** The loop only ends when `onError`/`onComplete` sets `completed`, so a bridge promise that simply _rejected_ left it parked on a wake promise nothing resolved — no error, no `complete`, just a load that never finishes, with the reason visible only as an unhandled rejection. That is reachable today: `NativeBridge.processGeometryStreamingPath` has no `try/catch` at all, so its missing-cache-key throw and every failure of the packed-shard stream it delegates to — including the Rust-reported `failed` status and the 60-second stall guard — reject straight out, and even the siblings that do route through `onError` can reject from the `init()`/`listen()` calls preceding their `try`. A rejected stream promise is now treated as a stream error, without shadowing a richer message an `onError` already reported.
  - **A stream failure that _did_ reach `onError` was dropped.** The `if (streamError) throw` check sat inside the drain loop's body, but `onError` both sets `completed` and leaves the queue empty — so the wake it triggers exits the loop past that check, and the generator reported `complete` for a stream that had failed. The check is now repeated on the way out.

  Both are behaviour changes on failing loads: a failure that previously hung or was reported as a successful `complete` now throws the underlying error.

  A load is only failed while the stream is still running, though. `NativeBridge.processGeometryStreaming` runs its three `unlisten()` calls in a `finally` — i.e. _after_ `onComplete` — so a throwing `unlisten` rejects the promise of a load that fully succeeded. Treating that as a stream failure would retro-fail a finished load and discard every mesh already delivered, and whether it did so depended on whether the rejection landed on the microtask queue or a turn later. A rejection that only ever reaches the detached `.catch()` after `onComplete`/`onError` has already settled the stream is therefore logged as teardown fallout and does not change the load's outcome.

  A `streamError` set by `onError` is a different signal, and is never gated on `completed` for exactly that reason: `onError` reporting a genuine failure must win no matter when it arrives. Both existing exit-guard checks only run while the drain loop still has a reason to spin or right as it exits, so an `onError` that fires later — while this generator is inside the teardown `finally`, awaiting the same `streamingPromise` — was recorded but never read again, and the caller still got `complete`. That gap is now closed by a third check after the `finally`, immediately before the `complete` yield.

  Collapsing the duplicate loop also changes three smaller things on `GeometryProcessor.processStreaming`'s native path, all of which bring it into line with the path- and cache-based native routes: its `complete` event now carries the native CSG/opening `diagnostics` when the bridge reports them; the pre-processing yield uses `scheduler.yield()` where the host provides it instead of always `setTimeout(0)`; and the `native-streaming` console timer is closed in a `finally`, so a failed load no longer leaves the label open for the next one. Queue coalescing and coordinate handling on that route are deliberately unchanged, passed through as explicit options.

  Newly logged rather than swallowed, at levels matching the surrounding code: a wasm-bindgen `free()` that throws while the geometry worker recovers from a failed batch (which means the abandoned engine instance keeps its file-sized source copy in the worker's never-shrinking wasm heap — logged once per worker, because the per-entity recovery path can run thousands of times in one load); a failed wasm heap-size read at session end; a `WebAssembly.compileStreaming` rejection that forces the shared-module compile onto the buffer path, and with it a second download of the engine binary; a worker `terminate()` that threw during pool teardown; and a failure to broadcast the `wasm-asset-unavailable` / `wasm-runtime-unrecoverable` events, which are the only way a host hears that the engine is gone.

  The parallel (multi-worker) streaming path had the same shape of gap at its own stream-end, in `processParallel`'s `sendStreamEnd`: a pool worker's `complete` is posted only in response to `stream-end` (`geometry.worker.ts`'s `emitSessionEnd`, called only from its `stream-end` handler), and the drain loop's completion barrier waits for a `complete` from every worker. A `stream-end` `postMessage` that failed for one worker was previously only logged — leaving that worker's `complete` never sent, so the barrier never closed and the load hung forever rather than erroring or falsely succeeding. It now sets the same load-failure state a worker crash does and terminates the unreachable worker, so the load throws instead of hanging.

- [#2134](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2134) [`5371d7d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/5371d7def2671f6568c838879b8be058bb6247c9) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Extract the streaming `complete` event's diagnostics payload builder (`geometry.worker.ts`'s `emitSessionEnd`) into a standalone `buildGeometryWorkerCompleteMessage` in `diagnostics.ts`, and have the worker call it instead of inlining the conditional spread. No behaviour change: the emitted payload is identical (diagnostics still omitted entirely, not sent as `undefined`, on a clean load). This lets `diagnostics.test.ts` exercise the real production logic directly — the worker module cannot be imported under vitest (it assigns `self.onmessage` at module load time), so the payload shape is now factored out where a plain unit test can reach it.

- [#2100](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2100) [`befc108`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/befc1083e377315231006352cb3fe95949e92b47) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Stop four package-level failures from being reported as ordinary results.

  - `@ifc-lite/data` / `@ifc-lite/cache`: a List-typed property with no value
    came back as `[]` — a real empty list — because the NULL string sentinel
    resolved to `''` and the resulting `JSON.parse` throw was swallowed. NULL
    now reads as `null`, matching the string branch beside it, and a genuinely
    unparseable list value logs once (latched) before falling back to `[]`.
  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `extractWallSegmentsForStorey` silently defaulted to a
    metre length-unit scale when unit extraction threw, mis-scaling every
    extracted wall segment on a millimetre model. It now warns with the error,
    matching `resolveSpatialAnchor` / `resolveDuplicateSource`.
  - `@ifc-lite/cli`: `ifc-lite schema` printed a reduced built-in schema as if
    it were the full SDK surface when `@ifc-lite/sandbox/schema` could not be
    loaded; it now says so on stderr and exits non-zero (stdout is still pure
    JSON, unchanged shape), so a piping caller that discards stderr still sees
    the failure. `--version` no longer reports a hard-coded `0.4.0` when
    `package.json` is unreadable — it reports `0.0.0-unknown` and explains why
    on stderr.
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: the shard and finalise paths that fall back from a
    SharedArrayBuffer view to a materialised (file-sized) copy now say so once
    per worker, matching the streaming-prepass path that already did.

- [#2072](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2072) [`0ceb99a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0ceb99a36125a2dfc8775e762d9f4f9ddb69d733) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Mask the prepass class byte before comparing it on the host ([#2065](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2065)).

  `rust/processing/src/shard_classes.rs` defines the per-record prepass class byte as a named code in the low bits (`PREPASS_CLASS_CODE_MASK` = `0x3F`) with flag bits composed on top (`PREPASS_CLASS_FLAG_GEOMETRY_JOB` = `0x80`, `PREPASS_CLASS_FLAG_TYPE_CANDIDATE` = `0x40`). The Rust consumer masks before matching (`gpu_meshes/prepass_discovery.rs`); the sharded-scan span-list rebuild in `geometry-parallel.ts` compared the whole byte against bare literals `4..10`.

  No output changes today: `classify_type_name` returns the named codes early, and the one later flag OR-in (`classify_type_name_with_content`) is gated on a spatial-container predicate that none of those keywords satisfy, so classes 4–10 never carry a flag bit as the classification rules stand. The failure mode if that ever changed was silent and total for the affected record — a flagged byte such as `0x80 | 4 = 132` is an out-of-bounds `Uint32Array` write (discarded without error) and misses the span-list map entirely, so the styled item, void, fill or aggregate would simply never appear.

  The span-list rebuild now lives in an exported, unit-tested `extractPrepassSpanLists()` that masks both comparisons, sizes its count table by the code mask rather than by the highest class the host consumes (so a class added on the Rust side can no longer write out of bounds), and names the codes as constants instead of restating them in a comment. A test pins those constants to the Rust source of truth.

### Minor Changes

- [#2015](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2015) [`0adb741`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0adb7413b869c9d50bdcdae5c00a730d17c2823f) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Carry the per-entity **proved enclosed volume** out of wasm, so the diff engine can weigh one element against several (issue [#1891](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1891)).

  `MeshCollection.geometryVolumeValues` shipped in [#1993](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1993) and had no TypeScript consumer; [#2005](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2005) plumbed the world AABB and deliberately left the volume behind, because carrying an array nothing reads is dead weight on every batch. The split/merge detector reads it, so it is plumbed now, along exactly the same three paths the box takes:

  - `MeshData.geometryVolume`, off the shared extractor in `geometry-fingerprints.ts`, gated by the same `enableGeometryHashes()` switch as the hash it travels with.
  - the worker boundary, as a transferable `Float64Array` with one value per hashed id — the same index-parallel layout the wasm getter uses, `NaN` reserving the slot of an entity whose volume was not proved rather than shortening the array.
  - `GeometryResult.instancedGeometryVolumes`, the instanced-only side-channel. Not an afterthought: an element is GPU-instanced precisely because it is one of many identical copies, and a precast slab field is exactly the population a split claim is made of.

  `geometryVolumeAt` is exported alongside `geometryAabbAt` for consumers decoding that side-channel off the streaming `batch` event.

  **Absent means NOT PROVED.** A value exists only where the meshed geometry was provably a single closed, orientable, single-component solid; measured coverage on a real corpus is 71.4% (24,073 of 33,701 elements). The `NaN` sentinel is resolved to `undefined` at the wasm boundary — as is a zero or a negative, which is a degenerate or inside-out solid rather than a small one — so nothing downstream ever holds a number it cannot believe. It is the volume of what was actually meshed, after opening cuts, so it is not an IFC `BaseQuantities` `GrossVolume` and must not be compared against one.

- [#2005](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2005) [`263c3ef`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/263c3efba5baf503f192700ba7f70ce08a1dafc8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Carry the per-entity world AABB out of WASM: `MeshData.geometryAabb`, `GeometryResult.instancedGeometryAabbs`, `geometryAabbAt`.

  Additive public API. `MeshCollection.geometryAabbValues` has existed since the WASM side shipped it, but nothing on this side of the FFI boundary read it, so the box had no consumers at all.

  - `MeshData.geometryAabb` — the whole-entity box, alongside `geometryHash` and populated by the same `GeometryProcessor.enableGeometryHashes()` switch. Every submesh of one entity carries the same box, exactly as it carries the same hash.
  - `GeometryResult.instancedGeometryAabbs` — the same boxes for entities whose entire geometry went to the GPU-instanced shard and therefore never appears in `meshes`. Keyed by express id, like the existing `instancedGeometryHashes`. Without this the boxes would be missing for precisely the repeated components a positional diff exists to pair.
  - `geometryAabbAt(values, index)` — the reader for the six-values-per-id layout, exported because that layout also crosses the geometry-worker boundary as the `batch` event's `instancedGeometryAabbValues`.

  Frame: **absolute world in the renderer's WebGL Y-up frame**, with the file's RTC offset and the per-element `origin` already folded in by the producer. Do not add `origin` to it, and do not substitute a box folded from `positions` — those are RTC- and origin-relative, so an element that moved would measure as stationary.

  The WASM side writes six `NaN`s for an entity it could not box, so the arrays stay index-parallel. That sentinel is resolved to `undefined` at this boundary: a `geometryAabb` you hold is always a real box, never a NaN-bearing one. A WASM build predating the getter degrades to hashes only, as before.

  `geometryVolumeValues` and `geometryClosureFlags` are deliberately NOT plumbed. Volume is groundwork for the split/merge detector, which is a later change; carrying an array nothing reads would be dead weight on every batch.

### Minor Changes

- [#1920](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1920) [`3dc3eb5`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3dc3eb56bd372ddd0e317347db1cad888dffd609) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - A WebAssembly runtime trap no longer bricks every geometry consumer in the document.

  `IfcLiteBridge` used to store one `Error` in a module-level global the first time any operation trapped, and then throw that same object from every subsequent `init()` for the rest of the page's life. Because the global is per-realm, a trap in one consumer (a GLB export, say) disabled every other main-thread consumer — the next model load, the grid and drawing meshers, all the other exporters — even though the trap could only ever have damaged the engine handle that took it. The stored object also carried the stack of the call that first trapped, so the error reported later, from an unrelated call, was undiagnosable.

  Now:

  - A trap taken by an _operation_ drops (and `free()`s — it used to leak) only the `IfcAPI` handle that took it, and propagates unchanged to the caller. Any later `init()`, on that bridge or another, builds a fresh handle and works.
  - A trap taken while _initializing_ is the one unrecoverable case: this realm has no working engine, and neither half is retryable in practice (a trap in `new IfcAPI()` leaves the module singleton already built, a trap in instantiation is deterministic). It is reported as a freshly constructed error whose message carries the stable `WASM_RUNTIME_UNRECOVERABLE` marker and the underlying trap verbatim, with the trap as `cause`, and it dispatches `WASM_RUNTIME_UNRECOVERABLE_EVENT` on `globalThis` so the host can offer the user a reload. The library never reloads the page itself.

  New exports: `isWasmRuntimeTrap`, `isWasmRuntimeUnrecoverableError`, `WASM_RUNTIME_UNRECOVERABLE_CODE`, `WASM_RUNTIME_UNRECOVERABLE_EVENT`.

### Patch Changes

- [#1921](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1921) [`428c5ae`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/428c5ae54bac236a3950f451ee12a0dc23226336) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - The WASM engine binary (`ifc-lite_bg.wasm`) is now downloaded resiliently and identifiably from every entry point.

  `IfcLiteBridge.init()` — the main-thread initialisation, and the only self-fetching `init()` in the codebase that still lacked one — now runs through `initWasmWithRetry`, the same one-shot retry both the geometry and parser workers have used since [#1363](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1363). A single blip on the ~1.3 MB engine download no longer fails the whole model load; a first-time visitor pulling the binary cold is the case this protects.

  `initWasmWithRetry` also names the binary when the final failure names nothing. A network-level rejection propagates raw out of wasm-bindgen's loader — WebKit words it `TypeError: Load failed`, Chromium `TypeError: Failed to fetch` — with an empty stack, so neither the user-facing message nor error tracking could tell what had failed to load. Such a failure is now rethrown as `Failed to load the WASM engine binary (ifc-lite_bg.wasm) in <label>: <original>`, with the original preserved as `.cause`. Messages that already identify themselves (any `wasm` / `WebAssembly` phrasing, and failed module imports) are passed through byte-for-byte so the stale-deployment matchers keep working.

  No public API surface changed.

  The ~3.9 MB wasm (~1.3 MB brotli) was fetched lazily by `processParallel`, putting the entire download between "user picks a file" and "first geometry". On a ~4 Mbit link that measured 2535 ms of dead wait for a 225 KB model. The compile is memoised per resolved binary URL, so a prewarmed module is simply awaited by the subsequent load, and a failed prewarm degrades to today's behaviour.

  Compile the geometry engine's `WebAssembly.Module` ONCE on the main thread and structured-clone that single compiled module to every geometry + pre-pass worker, which then `initSync` it (cheap) instead of each independently fetching and compiling the ~3.9 MB binary. Previously all N geometry workers plus the pre-pass worker called wasm-bindgen `init()`, so 4-5 parallel cold compiles of a multi-MB module contended on the CPU on a user's first load — producing a multi-second "WASM ready" stagger before any geometry appeared, and on large files enough startup latency to trip the geometry-stream stall watchdog. The worker already accepted a shared module but the path was dead code: it called `initSync({ module_or_path })` while wasm-bindgen's glue destructures `.module`, so it would have thrown `new WebAssembly.Module(undefined)` — and the host never sent a module. Uses `compileStreaming` (compile-while-download), caches the module for the session (federation/reload reuse it), and falls back to per-worker `init()` when the URL can't be resolved or compilation fails, so non-Vite consumers are unaffected. Geometry output is unchanged.

Also exported: `applySimplifiedGeometry` and the supporting types.

  `@ifc-lite/geometry` gains `GeometryProcessor.simplifyMeshes()` backed by the new wasm `simplifyMeshes` API (`SimplifiedMeshes`). `@ifc-lite/cli` gains `ifc-lite simplify <file.ifc> --level 1..5 [--ids ...] --out light.ifc [--json]` for dev/testing. `@ifc-lite/data` / `@ifc-lite/mutations` widen `IfcAttributeValue` with a write-only `{ real: number }` marker (serialized by `stepReal()` in `@ifc-lite/export`) so tessellation coordinates always carry a decimal point.

  - parser: new `unwrapIfcZipWithResources` surfaces sibling raster images (the files `IfcImageTexture.URLReference` points at) alongside the model entry, keyed by lowercased basename; `unwrapIfcZip` is unchanged.
  - geometry/wasm: `IfcImageTexture` now resolves to a lightweight reference (`textureId` = the `IfcSurfaceTexture` express id, URL, repeat flags) instead of being dropped — the host decodes the image once per id, so a 4096² JPEG shared by dozens of face sets is decoded and uploaded exactly once. `IfcIndexedTriangleTextureMap` with a null `TexCoordIndex` (the SketchUp IFC Manager export shape) now maps UVs 1:1 with the face set's coordinates per spec. Textured face sets on ORDINARY occurrences (direct `Body` items, not just type-product representation maps) now carry UVs + texture through the sub-mesh path, and blob/pixel texture decodes are Arc-shared instead of cloned per face set.
  - renderer: textured meshes with an external image reference render through the existing WebGPU textured pipeline via a refcounted shared-texture registry (one GPU texture per `textureId`, uploaded from the viewer-decoded `ImageBitmap`); per-mesh [#961](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/961) blob/pixel uploads are unchanged.
  - viewer: `.ifcZIP` loads decode sibling images with `createImageBitmap` and attach them to arriving meshes; textured models skip the binary geometry cache (which cannot persist textures yet) instead of silently losing textures on the second open.

The old "1.9x faster than web-ifc" figure predates both web-ifc 0.0.77 (which substantially improved its geometry speed) and ifc-lite's exact-arithmetic CSG kernel; the package now describes what is actually differentiating - exact boolean cuts verified element-by-element against IfcOpenShell.

The synchronous collect path spread the whole mesh batch into a single `Array.push(...)` call, which passes one argument per mesh and blows V8's argument ceiling; it now appends in a loop. The streaming path was never affected.

The worker batch handler also stops re-allocating a wrapper object per mesh (~110k per large load) and passes the structured-clone mesh objects straight through. Render parity is exact (verified mesh-count identical on 177MB and 883MB models).

### Minor Changes

- [#1720](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1720) [`8f3fafd`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8f3fafd7cc777e60cdc006956f8336680723c440) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Sharded pre-pass: parallel entity-index scan + parallel styles resolution for large fresh loads (`__IFC_LITE_SHARD_SCAN`).

  Idle geometry workers scan byte shards of the file (`scanEntityIndexShard`, wrapping the byte-identical `scan_shard` primitive plus a per-record prepass-class column), the host stitches the full entity index in under a second on a 19M-entity model, styled-item spans resolve as parallel slices on the workers (`resolveStyledItemsShard`, first-wins merge in file order), support spans come from the class column, and the canonical flatten (`finalizePrepassStyles`) seeds the merged styled maps BEFORE the material-chain resolution so output matches the serial resolver. The pre-pass itself starts after the stitch with the prebuilt index (`buildPrePassStreamingSharded`): no inline index build, full-index RTC resolution, no redundant index export. Stream-end defers while job chunks are queued behind the asynchronously finalized styles event.

  Measured on an 883 MB / 19.1M-entity CATIA model (3 workers): first visible geometry 14.3s -> 10.4s (-28%), stream complete 22.4s -> 15.4s (-31%), with identical final render stats. Flag off = the serial path, byte-for-byte.

- [#1722](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1722) [`a2c31a1`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a2c31a185e868d15183df8360badb001789bd978) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Sharded pre-pass stage 2: columns-driven discovery + column-based styles flatten.

  The shard scan now classifies every record (geometry job, type candidate, project/site, all support-span kinds), so the pre-pass fills its collectors from the stitched class columns in ~100ms and never byte-scans the file — meta and ALL job chunks arrive right after the stitch instead of behind a multi-second scan. The styles finalize keeps the shard-merged geometry styles as columns end to end (`flat_styles_rgba8_from_geometry_columns`): no 4M-entry hashmap seed, no hashmap rebuild in the flatten, byte-identical wire output. Same flag (`__IFC_LITE_SHARD_SCAN`), same serial fallback. BREAKING (@ifc-lite/wasm): `buildPrePassStreamingSharded` gains a required `index_classes` parameter (the class column is what makes columns discovery possible).

The styles tail is set by the slowest worker, and the OS occasionally schedules one onto a slow core — halving the slice size halves the damage, and the smaller slices interleave better with the concurrent pre-pass/parser work. Measured on an 883 MB CATIA model: styles 9.7-10.2s -> 5.5-5.8s, first visible geometry 9.9s -> ~7s (serial baseline: 14.3s). Slice order stays file order and the merge is by slice index, so first-wins precedence is unchanged.

  opt-in extra-type gate.

  On a content-dedup cache hit the item mesh was cloned and its full 128-bit
  `compute_mesh_hash_full` was re-run for instancing `rep_identity` on every
  occurrence (tens of thousands of times on repeated steel). The cache now stores
  the `rep_identity` beside the mesh, so a hit stamps it as a `u128` copy instead of
  re-hashing. Byte-identical output.

  Also adds `IFC_LITE_DEDUP_EXTRA` (default OFF) which extends content-dedup to
  `IfcPolygonalFaceSet` / `IfcTriangulatedFaceSet` / `IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel` /
  `IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel` (their structural signature is already complete);
  gated so low-reuse models never pay the hash for no payback.

  Note: the public Rust `ItemDedupCache` value type changes from `Arc<Mesh>` to
  `Arc<(Mesh, Option<u128>)>`. The alias is an opaque handle outside the workspace
  (keys come from private `item_dedup_key`); this is an intentional 0.x source
  break for any external Rust code that constructed map entries by hand.

  it to the export menu ([#1427](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1427)).

  > Note: KMZ 3D models (`<Model>`) only render in Google Earth **Pro** (desktop). Google
  > Earth on the web does not support `<Model>` — for the web, export GLB and use the web
  > app's "Import 3D model". The dialog and menu say so.

  **It now loads in Pro.** Google Earth's KML `<Model>` only accepts **COLLADA** — a
  glTF/GLB model fails with "Unsupported element: Model". The KMZ now embeds a COLLADA
  `.dae` (new `exportKmzFromMeshes` / `export_collada_from_meshes`, schema-validated against
  the COLLADA 1.4.1 XSD) instead of a GLB. Large models are split into multiple `<geometry>`
  chunks bounded by 60k vertices / 20k triangles (Google Earth's 64K-vertex / 21,845-triangle
  per-mesh limits) and vertices are deduplicated, so big structural models render in Pro.

  **It's no longer dark or floating.** COLLADA materials set `<emission>` to the element
  colour (Google Earth has no ambient/IBL and a single hard sun, so plain diffuse renders
  near-black) and are flagged `double_sided` for IFC's unreliable winding. By default the
  model is placed `clampToGround` so it rests on the terrain instead of floating at its MSL
  `OrthogonalHeight`. Vertices are emitted in the IFC-native Z-up frame so the building
  stands upright.

  **Placement is now a choice.** The KMZ export dialog adds a "Placement" toggle: "Rest on
  ground" (default, `clampToGround`) or "True elevation (MSL)" (`absolute`, honouring the
  model's `OrthogonalHeight`). The choice threads through `exportKmzFromMeshes`
  (`altitudeMode` argument) and the `exportKmz` / `exportKmzFromMeshes` wasm bindings
  (optional `altitude_mode`, defaulting to `clampToGround` so existing callers are
  unchanged). The Location panel's one-click Google Earth button stays ground-clamped.

  **It's in the menu.** A new "Export KMZ (Google Earth Pro)" entry sits alongside Export
  GLB / IFC / HBJSON, using the same model-name file-stem scheme (`<name>.kmz`); it reports
  a clear message when a model isn't georeferenced.

  Also adds a general `emissive` option to the GLB exporter (`exportGlb` /
  `exportGlbFromMeshes`) — `emissiveFactor = base colour` for renderers without ambient/IBL.

The `cores >= 16` tier was the only one without the `>512MB` file-size clamp, so a 16-core desktop spawned `cores/2 = 8` geometry workers on an 883MB model - each a private wasm realm holding a full source copy plus its own entity index (~1.3GB per worker, ~10.6GB total), producing 16GB memory peaks. Huge-file geometry is memory-bandwidth bound (a 5th/6th worker gives no measured speedup), so the tier now caps at 4 workers above 512MB, matching the 12-core tier. `?geomWorkers=N` still overrides per host.

- [#1680](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1680) [`bc1531f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bc1531f899e5f8d18d1a6ff1ef6d997236a01243) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Harden huge-file loads against stale deployments and the wasm32 ceiling. (1) A geometry or pre-pass worker whose SCRIPT fails to load (a redeploy rotated the hashed asset; the 404 is served as text/plain and the browser blocks the worker with an empty-message onerror) now dispatches the existing version-skew recovery event so the viewer reloads once onto the current deployment, instead of dying with "Pre-pass worker failed: undefined". (2) The parser skips the byte-level WASM entity scan for sources over 2.5GB: the buffer copy plus entity index cannot fit in wasm32's 4GB address space, so the scan always trapped with `unreachable executed` before the JS tokeniser fallback ran anyway.

The Rust `RectFastSummary` already emits it (the opening-count DoS cap, [#1649](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1649)); the `GeometryDiagnostics.rectFast` and server-client types now include it (optional, defaulted to 0 when absent so older payloads merge cleanly), `mergeGeometryDiagnostics` sums it, and the CLI geometry report renders it in the rect_fast defer breakdown.

The streaming prepass copies the whole file into wasm linear memory and builds the entity index alongside it; on wasm32 (4GB address space) a ~3GB+ model can't fit, so the allocator aborted with an opaque trap. Two changes: (1) cap the entity-index up-front reservation (`content.len() / 50` reserved ~1GB of hash slots for a ~4GB file, on top of the resident file — that alone blew the budget before the scan; now capped, a rare huge model grows the map via rehash instead of aborting), which lifts the practical browser ceiling and lowers peak memory for every large model; (2) when the prepass still traps on a very large file, surface an actionable error ("This model is X GB, which exceeds the browser's ~3GB WebAssembly ceiling — open it in the desktop app") rather than the cryptic wasm trap. Ordinary (<2GB) models are unaffected (their reservation stays under the cap; the error helper never fires).

On a streaming load each of the N geometry workers independently re-walked the whole 200-340MB file on its first batch to build the `MaterialLayerIndex` (fires on the default Model view for layered architectural models), the referenced-`IfcRepresentationMap` set, and the instantiated-type set ([#957](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/957)) — 3xN concurrent full-file walks, the mechanism behind the per-worker warmup that anti-scales the pool. These are now computed ONCE from spans in the prepass's single existing scan (no extra walk) and shipped to workers via new `setReferencedRepmaps` / `setInstantiatedTypeIds` / `setMaterialLayerIndex` setters, exactly like the entity index. Byte-identical: `MaterialLayerIndex::from_spans` feeds the identical spans through the shared insert step (order-sensitive Sliceable rule preserved) and the id-sets are membership-only; proven by a `from_content == from_spans == from_flat(from_spans.to_flat())` test and the mesh-determinism manifest (no re-pin). The lazy per-worker build remains as a fallback when the injected columns are absent (native + non-streaming paths unchanged). The per-triangle indexed-colour-map is deliberately NOT hoisted (its payload scales with triangle count, so shipping it would add bandwidth on the colour-mapped files it targets).

Worst-failing hosts now also report a world-space bounding box and final triangle count when a void cut captured them, surfaced in both `--json` and the human-readable report.

  Fixed `--quiet`/`--verbose` on `diagnose-geometry`: its status line ("Wrote diagnostics to...") now routes through the leveled logger like every other command, so `--quiet` actually silences it instead of always printing to stdout via a raw `console.log`. The JSON/report payload itself is unaffected by verbosity, same as every other command.

Both paths are idempotent -- calling `dispose()` more than once, or combining an explicit call with the `using` scope exit, never double-frees the wasm-bindgen pointer.

The faceted-brep mesher emits geometry per `IfcFace` with no cross-face vertex sharing, so a closed shell duplicates every shared corner once per incident face (~3-6x). That collapse now happens once, at the single per-element mesh funnel (`build_mesh_data` in `produce_element_meshes`), so every element -- render, GLB/OBJ export, and analysis -- arrives welded in its `MeshData`, and the previously separate per-export welds (from-bytes `to_yup` and the viewer's from-meshes GLB path) are removed as redundant. The weld keys on the exact position plus a quantized normal, so creases (a cube corner shared by three faces with distinct normals) stay split and flat/crease shading is preserved; world triangles, winding, and the world AABB are unchanged. It is deterministic and byte-identical cross-arch (native == wasm32, positions and topology identical, only the documented libm-trig normals differ), and closes the volume/watertightness gap for non-voided faceted breps on the render path (voided elements already welded via the coplanar-facet pass). The mesh-output determinism manifests are re-pinned for the one affected battery element (the round column [#500](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/500), an extruded circular profile: 216 -> 144 vertices, triangle count unchanged).

The faceted-brep mesher emits geometry per `IfcFace` with no cross-face vertex sharing, so a closed shell duplicated every shared corner once per incident face (~3-6x) -- the direct cause of the ~8x-larger GLBs seen on structural (faceted-brep-heavy) models versus reference extractors. Exports now collapse vertices that share an identical position and coinciding normal at the single glTF write funnel, then remap indices. World triangles, the world AABB, and flat/crease shading are preserved exactly (creases keep distinct normals and stay split); the weld is deterministic and cross-arch, applies to every GLB path (in-memory, streaming, bounded, and the viewer's from-meshes export), and leaves `process_geometry` output and the mesh-output determinism manifests untouched.

RTC-offset detection sampled a bogus `(0,0,0)` world position for origin-placed, curve-only entities such as `IfcAlignmentSegment` (their only representation is an axis curve, so no body vertex could be read). Those spurious origin votes outnumbered the handful of large-coordinate solids and dragged the detected re-basing offset to zero, so vertices at national-grid magnitudes (~166 km) were cast to f32 with ~16 mm quantization and small features (signals, kerbs) rendered mangled. Curve/axis-only elements now abstain from the RTC sample when they have no meshable body representation, letting the real solids anchor the offset; body elements at the origin still cast their "no shift" vote.

### Major Changes

- [#1491](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1491) [`6d2cb21`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6d2cb21a170413c6c98aadf10d254667b2ed2b53) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - feat(export): large-model GLB reliability - bounded memory, fail-closed, byte returns

  Three related hardening changes on the export surface:

  - **Bounded-memory GLB.** Inputs at or above 64 MB (native override
    `IFC_LITE_GLB_STREAM_THRESHOLD_MB`, `0` disables) are exported through a
    two-pass streaming assembler: pass 1 records per-mesh metadata only, pass 2
    re-streams and bakes vertex bytes directly into an exactly-preallocated GLB.
    Peak memory is the final artifact plus one mesh batch instead of the whole
    model's meshes plus multiple full-buffer copies - this fixes the wasm
    `RuntimeError: unreachable` / OOM on large in-browser exports. Models without
    instanceable groups produce byte-identical output; instanced models keep
    identical world geometry (rep-identity instancing is skipped above the
    threshold, content-hash dedup is kept).

  - **Fail-closed empty GLB at the boundary.** `exportGlb` now throws a typed
    `Error` whose message starts with `NO_RENDER_GEOMETRY` when the visible mesh
    set is empty, instead of returning a structurally valid but empty GLB.
    `@ifc-lite/geometry` exports `NO_RENDER_GEOMETRY` and
    `isNoRenderGeometryError(err)` to match it; the CLI and MCP map it to their
    existing tailored messages.

  - **BREAKING: sibling exporters return bytes.** `exportObj`, `exportCsv`,
    `exportJson`, `exportJsonld`, `exportIfcx`, `exportStep`, `exportMerged` and
    `exportHbjson` (wasm boundary, `IfcLiteBridge`, and `GeometryProcessor`) now
    return `Uint8Array` (UTF-8) instead of `string`, so output is no longer capped
    by the V8 max-string ceiling (~512 MB) - the same escape GLB already had.
    Decode with `TextDecoder` where a string is genuinely needed; file writers
    should write the bytes directly.

### Minor Changes

- [#1486](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1486) [`8e43ecf`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8e43ecf540b88b942a4ec2127dd9bcf24ec244fa) Thanks [@Blogbotana](https://github.com/Blogbotana)! - feat(renderer): expose per-element local (object-space) bounding box + placement transform

  Recovering an element's TRUE oriented dimensions (length/width/height for a
  rotated/tilted member) previously required an expensive client-side vertex
  scan + PCA, since `Scene.getEntityBoundingBox` only returns a world-space
  (axis-aligned-to-world) AABB. The geometry pipeline already resolves each
  element's placement and briefly holds its pre-placement, object-space extent —
  this surfaces both instead of discarding them (issue [#1474](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1474)):

  - `Scene.getEntityLocalBounds(expressId)` — the element's local (pre-placement)
    AABB, O(1) lookup. Unions across a multi-piece entity's mesh pieces (material
    layers, CSG parts) — all pieces of one element share a local frame, so no
    reconciliation is needed. For a GPU-instanced entity, returns the shared
    template's local box.
  - `Scene.getEntityTransform(expressId)` — the resolved `IfcLocalPlacement`
    chain, row-major 4×4, Y-up metres. For an instanced entity, returns the
    specific occurrence's transform.
  - `MeshData` gains `localBounds`/`localToWorld` (optional, session-only — not
    persisted to the disk/IndexedDB geometry cache, recomputed fresh each load
    like GPU-instancing metadata).

  Both return `null` for a container/assembly with no mesh (e.g.
  `IfcElementAssembly`) or when not captured (older cached geometry). Consumers
  can pair the two to reconstruct an oriented bounding box, or use it as a
  fallback when `Qto_*` `Length`/`Width`/`Height` quantities are absent.

- [#1493](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1493) [`b66ff1d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b66ff1dd915a0ff4f60198a511adb7ed7f714079) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Flip the PARAMETRIC rectangular-opening fast path (`IFC_LITE_RECT_PARAM`) to
  DEFAULT ON. The path subtracts rectangular openings as exact parametric boxes
  in the host wall's own placement frame (rotated walls included), producing a
  watertight, analytically exact cut and deferring any non-clean case (non-rect
  host or opening, frame mismatch, mesh/parametric disagreement, overlap,
  engulfing redundant void) to the exact kernel unchanged.

  Corpus-validated before the flip with a new A/B harness
  (`rust/geometry/tests/rect_param_validate.rs`, run over AC20-FZK-Haus,
  dental_clinic, advanced_model, ISSUE_068 and ISSUE_129): every element where
  the path does not fire is byte-identical ON vs OFF (24,345 of 24,744 jobs;
  the rest fired), and every fired host (399 across the corpus) is watertight
  and matches the analytic box-minus-boxes ground truth within 0.5%. On firing
  hosts the output is MORE correct than the exact kernel on engulfing-opening
  walls (the kernel's documented 9-34% over-cut), so fired geometry is not
  byte-equal to the old kernel output by design.

  `IFC_LITE_RECT_PARAM=0` (native) and `setRectParamFastPath(false)` (wasm)
  remain as opt-out escape hatches for the parametric path alone, and
  `IFC_LITE_RECT_FAST=0` stays the global rect-fast kill switch: it disables the
  legacy AND the parametric path, so that single flag still forces every
  rectangular opening through the exact kernel (parity debugging / bisection).
  wasm reads no env, so both targets default ON in lockstep and the native==wasm
  byte contract is preserved.

- [#1492](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1492) [`3d25765`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3d25765edc2cee40268a6d5a27d4055f88f76489) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Enforce and harden mesh-output determinism (pinned cross-target manifest).

  `consolidate_coplanar` emitted CSG-cut meshes in FxHashMap plane-bucket
  iteration order, which differs between 64-bit native and 32-bit wasm32
  (FxHasher mixes usize-wide chunks): the same cut produced the same triangles
  in a different order per target. The buckets are now a BTreeMap, making
  every cut mesh byte-identical native == wasm32 (order-only change; the
  triangle set is untouched).

  The prepass flat wire arrays (`flat_voids`, `flat_material_colors`,
  `flat_styles_rgba8`) are now emitted sorted by id (u32 ascending) - an
  explicit wire-order contract instead of an implicit hash-order artifact.
  Consumers rebuild maps from these arrays, so behaviour is unchanged.

  A new mesh-output determinism manifest
  (`rust/processing/tests/manifests/mesh_determinism.json` + wasm32 pair) pins
  the full pipeline's emitted bytes at Medium tessellation across x86_64,
  arm64 and wasm32, wired into the determinism CI workflow. Contract:
  `docs/architecture/mesh-determinism.md`.

## 2.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 1b148c1: Fix walls being sliced flat at a height (gable/roof top removed, windows left
  floating) after #1440. The malformed-void-cutter detector (`opening_obb_if_malformed`)
  flagged ANY cutter with a vertex >4 m beyond its near vertex cluster as "garbage".
  A legitimate roof/gable cut — a watertight prism authored to reach far up (e.g.
  ~900 m) to clip a wall down to the roofline — trips that test on its structural
  top vertices, so the real cut was skipped and replaced by a horizontal slab,
  slicing every roof-capped wall flat.

  Gate the detector on a closed-manifold check: a cutter that welds (by position)
  to a closed 2-manifold is a VALID SOLID and is never reshaped, so roof/gable
  prisms and clean opening boxes are spared. Only genuinely broken cutters
  (self-intersecting / fin-laden tessellated voids, which leave boundary or
  non-manifold edges) still get the #1440 repair. The spike/flap regression
  (`multi_body_void_spike`) and the full geometry suite stay green; output matches
  the pre-#1440 (correct) result byte-for-byte on the reported model.

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 24e1648: Make the Rust-backed exporters reliable on large and degenerate inputs.

  Remove the ~512 MB input cap on GLB/glTF (and the sibling OBJ, CSV, JSON, JSON-LD,
  STEP, IFCX, HBJSON exporters). They decoded the entire input IFC byte buffer into a
  single JS string via `safeUtf8Decode` before crossing into WASM, where the binding
  immediately turned it back into bytes (`content.as_bytes()`). For an input over V8's
  `0x1fffffe8` (~512 MB) string ceiling that decode threw "Cannot create a string longer
  than 0x1fffffe8 characters", so files in the 0.5 GB+ range failed before any geometry
  ran. The boundary now passes the raw `Uint8Array`/`&[u8]` straight through (matching the
  existing `exportMerged` path), which removes the cap, drops a redundant full-buffer copy
  and a UTF-8 re-encode, and is byte-faithful for non-UTF-8 input.

  Scope: this lifts the cap on the INPUT side for all exporters. GLB returns a
  `Uint8Array`, so its output also escapes the V8 ceiling; the string-returning
  exporters (OBJ/CSV/JSON/JSON-LD/STEP/IFCX/HBJSON) still cap their serialized OUTPUT
  at the same ~512 MB string limit. In-browser, the wasm32 linear-memory heap (not the
  string cap) is the practical ceiling for the very largest models.

  Fail loud on an empty GLB export. A malformed-but-parseable model (or a filter whose
  matched entities carry no triangulated geometry) produced a structurally valid GLB with
  zero meshes, which the CLI and MCP tools wrote to disk and reported as success. Both now
  reject a zero-mesh GLB with a clear error (new `countGlbMeshes` helper in
  `@ifc-lite/export`).

  Guard the GLB assembler against the glTF 32-bit buffer limit. The assembler cast every
  buffer offset and byteLength `as u32`; past 4 GiB those casts silently wrapped (release
  builds disable overflow checks) and emitted a corrupt GLB. It now sums the binary buffer
  length in `usize` and asserts the 4 GiB ceiling with a clear message instead of wrapping.

- 7c45192: Instance repeated geometry in GLB/glTF export (50-85% smaller on repetitive models).

  The from-bytes GLB assembler baked every element occurrence in full, so a model with
  hundreds of identical windows, doors, or steel parts (one IFC `RepresentationMap`
  referenced by many `IfcMappedItem`s) emitted that geometry hundreds of times. The
  exporter now reuses the same representation-identity collation the GPU/native
  instancing path uses: each repeated shape is emitted ONCE and every occurrence is
  placed with a glTF node matrix carrying its world pose.

  Each occurrence's node matrix is recomputed in f64 from the per-occurrence world
  placement, the model RTC / site-local offset the baker subtracted, and the Z-up to Y-up
  basis change, then folded against the model-wide scene centre before the single f32
  downcast. Doing the relative transform in the post-RTC baked frame (not the placement's
  pre-RTC frame) is what keeps a ROTATED occurrence correct under a non-zero site/georef
  offset — otherwise it is mis-translated by `(R - I) * rtc`, kilometres at national-grid
  coordinates. The f64 composition keeps the absolute-magnitude terms cancelling to a
  model-relative, f32-precise translation even at national-grid scale.

  Only exact-bit groups are instanced (the template's local geometry IS each occurrence's),
  so the exported per-occurrence geometry is byte-faithful; rigid-tier and any
  singular-placement groups fall back to the flat path. Two round-trip tests reconstruct
  every instanced occurrence's world geometry from `root.translation * node.matrix *
template_local` and match the baked geometry to under a millimetre — one on a real model,
  one synthetic with a rotated instance at national-grid coordinates.

  Non-instanced occurrences keep the existing self-contained `world - scene_center` vertex
  bake (no node transform), so a consumer that ignores node transforms still sees them
  correctly placed. The flat remainder is additionally content-hash deduped (byte-identical
  baked meshes share one mesh placed by a node translation), so the output never regresses
  below the prior per-occurrence baseline on models without representation-level repeats.

  Measured GLB size: C20-Institute 4.0 -> 1.3 MB (-68%), AC20-Smiley 13.0 -> 2.4 MB (-82%),
  schependomlaan 15.5 -> 7.6 MB (-51%); models with no repeats are unchanged. Output is
  byte-deterministic. The viewer's from-meshes GLB path is unaffected (it carries no
  instancing side-channel and falls back to the flat content-hash dedup).

- 4f76955: Decouple the small-cut skip (#1286) from the tessellation tier and use it for the
  viewer's on-screen load.

  `GeometryProcessor` gains a `skipSmallCuts` option (and the WASM `IfcAPI` a
  `setSkipSmallCuts` binding) that drops tiny `IfcBooleanResult` detail cuts (steel
  copes/notches) WITHOUT lowering the tessellation tier, so curved geometry keeps
  full density while the dominant boolean-heavy load cost is skipped. The viewer
  enables it for the streaming display load (boolean-heavy steel models reach
  Manifold-class first paint); exporters and drawings leave it off, so their
  geometry keeps every cut. Default off everywhere else, so all other output stays
  byte-identical.

- 909c1b0: Add a typed `GeometryDiagnostics` contract for CSG / opening diagnostics.

  The WASM batch path already computed a rich CSG / opening diagnostic summary
  (opening classification, per-reason failure breakdown, per-host detail, silent
  rectangular no-op detection, rect_fast fast-path engagement) and then discarded it,
  logging only to the browser console. A package consumer could not subscribe to it
  without scraping console output.

  This surfaces it as a typed, serializable contract:

  - `rust/geometry` exposes a `GeometryDiagnostics` struct and a wasm-free
    `aggregate_diagnostics` built from the drained router data, so the same shape is
    producible on the WASM and native paths from a single drain.
  - The WASM `MeshCollection` exposes the per-batch `diagnostics` as a JS object
    (replacing the earlier two scalar getters).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry` exports the `GeometryDiagnostics` type and
    `mergeGeometryDiagnostics`, and surfaces a per-load `diagnostics` object on the
    streaming `complete` event: the geometry worker merges per-batch diagnostics
    across batches and the parallel loader merges across workers, logging one
    aggregate console summary.
  - The viewer reads `event.diagnostics` and logs a concise summary when CSG failures
    or silent no-ops occur; the full typed object rides the streaming event for a UI
    or telemetry consumer to subscribe to.
  - Native parity: the `rust/processing` geometry pass drains opening classification +
    per-host diagnostics from each per-element router and aggregates them through the
    same `aggregate_diagnostics`, attaching the full contract to
    `ProcessingStats.geometry_diagnostics` (the WASM bundle and the server emit it). The
    native streaming bridge forwards it onto the viewer `complete` event, so the
    native-only deployed viewer surfaces the same diagnostics as the WASM path, and
    `@ifc-lite/server-client` types it on the stats response.
  - CLI / SDK surface: a new wasm `diagnoseGeometry(bytes)` binding runs the same
    `process_geometry` pass and returns only its `GeometryDiagnostics`, exposed as
    `GeometryProcessor.diagnoseGeometry` and an `ifc-lite diagnose-geometry <file.ifc>`
    command (human-readable report, or `--json` for the raw contract).

  `totalCsgFailures` and the classification counts are exact; `productsWithFailures`,
  `hostsWithOpenings` and `silentNoOps` are batch-summed upper bounds.

### Patch Changes

- e6bd2dd: Cap the number of void cutters packed into a single CSG arrangement, fixing a
  geometry-stream stall on models with elements that carry many openings.

  `subtract_mesh_many` previously subtracted every disjoint cutter of a host in ONE
  N-ary conforming arrangement. That arrangement's cost is super-linear in the
  cutters packed into it, so an element with ~90 openings cost ~12 s in a single
  arrangement (vs ~0.4 s chunked, 30x). On WASM that single element alone exceeded
  the 40 s geometry-stream watchdog: an 86 MB model that loaded in ~15 s natively
  stalled and failed to load in the browser. Because the per-element escalation
  budget bounds escalations, not the base arrangement size, it did not catch this.

  Void cutters here are order-free (set difference: `host − {all} ≡ host − {chunk₁}
− {chunk₂} − …`), so the cutters are now processed in chunks of 16, bounding the
  per-arrangement cost so no single element can stall the stream. It is
  solid-equivalent (the batch path's contract is volume parity + watertightness,
  not byte-identical tessellation; the existing `subtract_many_*_matches_sequential`
  equivalence tests and a new 20-cutter chunked-equivalence test all pass, and the
  full geometry suite is unchanged). For hosts with <= 16 cutters this is exactly
  the prior single arrangement. Verified end to end: the previously-stalling model
  now loads completely and renders correctly.

  Bumps the geometry cache `FORMAT_VERSION` (10 → 11). For a host with > 16 void
  cutters the chunked cut is solid-equivalent but not byte-identical (and on
  pre-fix builds those hosts often fell back to an AABB box), so the mesh hash
  changes. The bump invalidates pre-fix caches so restored models re-mesh with the
  correct tessellation, and the compare/diff feature does not flag those hosts from
  a stale-cache hash mismatch.

- f9f0784: Fix GLB export collapse on georeferenced models with rotated instanced occurrences.

  The GPU-instancing collator built each occurrence's relative transform as
  `rel = m_k · m_ref⁻¹` on the **pre-RTC** (absolute, georeferenced-magnitude)
  placements stored in `InstanceMeta.transform`, while the baked template `origin`
  is **post-RTC** (small). For an occurrence rotated relative to its template,
  `rel.translation = T_k − R_rel·T_ref` — and when the rotation flips an axis the
  two ~1e6 m terms _add_ instead of cancel, reaching **2× the georeference**. The
  renderer then applies that to the small template origin, so those occurrences fly
  out to twice the site offset. On a georeferenced model (e.g. EPSG:4326 rebar) this
  dragged the GLB exporter's scene-center to ~6e6 m and re-snapped every f32 vertex
  to a ~0.5 m grid, collapsing the whole model on export / re-import.

  `collate_refs` now takes the applied RTC and reduces both composed transforms to
  the post-RTC frame before forming the relative transform, so the offset cancels
  exactly regardless of rotation and the relative translation stays at building
  scale (consistent with the small template origin the renderer applies it to). The
  `processGeometryBatchInstanced` shard path passes the real RTC; the from-bytes
  glTF exporter passes `[0,0,0]` because it already conjugates by RTC per occurrence
  downstream. Non-georeferenced models (RTC `[0,0,0]`) are unchanged.

  Verified end to end: instanced occurrences for a georeferenced model now stay at
  building scale (was ~1.2e7 m), the viewer GLB export is precise (±9 m, was ±6e6 m
  collapsed), and the export → re-import round-trip is geometrically intact.

- 6eb46f1: Right-size the geometry worker pool: narrow the small-file fast path from 8-64 MB
  to <= 24 MB.

  A 10-core browser worker-count sweep found the 8-64 MB `cores - 2` band (#1258)
  over-provisioned workers for decode- and heavy-tail-bound models in the 24-64 MB
  range. Because each worker is a separate WASM instance that re-decodes the file
  into its own heap and rebuilds the entity index, 8 workers ran 20-30% SLOWER than
  4 at up to ~5x the peak WASM memory (e.g. ~882 MB vs ~161 MB on a 54 MB model).
  Measured improvements at the new auto-selected count: a 34 MB heavy-tail model
  7.2s -> 5.7s (-21%), a 54 MB decode-bound model 14.4s -> 11.7s (-19%) at roughly
  half the peak memory. Genuinely small compute-bound steel (a 20 MB model with
  ~26k boolean jobs) still benefits from `cores - 2` (17.0s vs 22.9s at 4 workers),
  so the fast path is kept for <= 24 MB where the per-worker re-decode/memory cost
  is low; > 24 MB now falls through to the existing per-core bandwidth cap (4 on a
  10-core host). The > 512 MB bandwidth caps and the memory-budget cap are
  unchanged. A fully workload-aware count (using the real prepass job/CSG density
  instead of the file-size proxy) is a follow-up.

- 3f25a72: Fix two rendering defects from malformed self-intersecting tessellated void
  cutters (window/door openings authored as `IfcPolygonalFaceSet` whose point list
  carries garbage vertices metres from the real opening, plus a sibling multi-body
  extruded cutter). The exact mesh-arrangement kernel mishandles such cutters two
  ways, both fixed without touching the cut path:

  - A far-flung "fin" triangle leaked into the host output as a multi-metre spike
    poking out of the wall, surfacing only under the multi-cutter arrangement (so
    it slipped past the per-cutter admission guards). A boolean subtract can only
    REMOVE material, so the result is contained in the host's pre-cut AABB; any
    output triangle reaching beyond it is provably an artifact and is now dropped
    (`Mesh::clip_triangles_to_aabb`, which also compacts the orphaned vertices so
    bounds/picking/clash/export stay correct).

  - The same cutters made the kernel UNDER-cut, leaving a wall flap bridging the
    opening on the wall face. For each cutter detected as malformed (intrinsic
    vertex clustering, since a fin running along a long wall stays inside its
    AABB), the real opening box is recovered and wall triangles overlapping its
    cross-section are dropped (`clip_opening_flaps`), sparing the reveal/jamb
    faces on the boundary.

  Both passes are gated to provably-broken cutters and are a no-op on clean
  openings, so well-formed models are byte-identical.

Materialized occurrences now carry a stable per-occurrence `occurrenceKey` (new optional field on `MeshData`), and the snap geometry cache keys on `occurrenceKey ?? expressId`, so snap works on every occurrence and the cache no longer collides instanced pieces with a flat mesh of the same `expressId`.

When a production deploy rotates the content-hashed `ifc-lite_bg-<hash>.wasm` under a still-open tab, the lazy fetch 404s (served as `text/plain`) and `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` throws `Response has unsupported MIME type 'text/plain' … expected 'application/wasm'` — the engine never initializes ([#1363](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1363)). A same-URL retry can't recover a rotated asset, so the geometry engine now classifies this case (`isWasmAssetUnavailableError`) and dispatches a `WASM_ASSET_UNAVAILABLE_EVENT` on `globalThis` at its init choke points (the main-thread `GeometryProcessor.init` and the worker-pool error handlers). The library never reloads the page itself; an opted-in host (the viewer) listens and reloads once onto the current deployment.

The void router merged every body of such a high-vertex opening into one cutter and subtracted them in a single arrangement, which left diagonal "bridge" triangles spanning some of the holes. An opening is now split into one cutter per body when its bodies form 2 or more disjoint spatial clusters, so each window is cut on its own. Bodies that touch or overlap (one void split into adjacent parts, e.g. inner/outer wall-leaf halves of a window) still subtract merged, so the gable-wall watertightness path is unchanged.

  - Two rectangular openings on perpendicular walls whose world AABBs cross at a building corner were merged into one phantom bounding box and punched a hole through both walls. The opening merge now fires only when the two boxes coincide on at least two axes (so `bbox(A,B) == A ∪ B`, no phantom volume), which still collapses the aligned/tiled openings the merge exists to optimize.
  - A deep box opening (cutter deeper than the wall is thick) had its through-host penetration axis guessed as its thinnest AABB axis, which for such cutters is in-plane rather than through-wall. The cap-flush extension then ran along the wrong axis and latched onto a neighbouring void's reveal facet, growing the hole ~0.3 m on later-cut openings. The penetration axis is now inferred from the axis along which the opening pierces past the host, falling back to thinnest only for genuinely flush cutters.

  The sub-mesh placement path (`apply_submesh_placement`) — taken by every
  multi-item element, which is all Tekla-style steel (beams, plates, assemblies)
  — baked the element's world placement into the vertices but never recorded it
  into `instance_meta.transform`, leaving the IDENTITY placeholder. The single-mesh
  path (`apply_placement`) already records it; the sub-mesh path did not. So
  `collate_refs` computed `rel_k = m_k · m_ref⁻¹ = identity` for every occurrence
  of a template and they all stacked on the first one, leaving every other position
  empty. The flat (non-instanced) path was always correct, and content-dedup made
  it look like ~half the model was gone. Now each sub-mesh records the scaled
  per-element placement before baking, mirroring the single-mesh path.

  and instances referencing missing templates; carry geometry-diff hashes for
  instanced-only entities so model compare still detects their changes; fix the
  raycast BVH to rebuild on a same-count-different-members instanced set and the
  instanced-piece dedup key collision; tombstone instanced-only entities on
  delete/split; wire instanced occurrences into the CPU enumeration / raycast
  paths; reset instancing metadata in Mesh::clear; guard verify_recomposition
  against vertex-count mismatches; validate the transparent-instanced pipeline via
  a GPU error scope.

- [#1238](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1238) [`e753e96`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e753e96f9b76cc406e52a7bd9c36b312dc14bf6b) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add a decoder for the instanced ("IFNS") geometry shard format
  (`decodeInstancedShard`, `isInstancedShard`). It mirrors the Rust
  `encode_instanced`/`decode_instanced` codec and carries each unique template
  geometry once plus a per-occurrence instance row (transform + entity id +
  colour), so a future renderer path can upload a template once and GPU-instance
  its occurrences. Additive and unused by the default path; verified against a
  Rust-produced fixture (cross-language round-trip + expand-to-flat).

- [#1238](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1238) [`e753e96`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e753e96f9b76cc406e52a7bd9c36b312dc14bf6b) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Render genuinely-repeated opaque geometry via GPU instancing. The geometry worker
  now produces each batch once via `processGeometryBatchPartitioned`, which routes
  occurrences by per-batch repetition: a geometry whose `rep_identity` occurs at
  least `INSTANCE_MIN_OCCURRENCES` (8) times in the batch collapses to one template

  - per-occurrence transforms in a GPU-instancing shard; everything else
    (singletons, low-count, non-instanceable, plus all transparent / textured /
    type-template geometry) goes to the flat `MeshCollection` and is consolidated +
    frustum-culled exactly as before. This keeps the instancing upload/memory win for
    truly-repeated geometry (mullions, fasteners, identical parts) while keeping
    unique geometry on the cheap consolidated draw path — instancing every singleton
    as a 1-instance template would issue one draw call per mesh and tank orbit
    framerate. The shard is posted as `instancedShards`, decoded, and GPU-instanced;
    picking, selection highlight, and colour overlays (lens / IDS / compare / 4D) all
    operate per-instance, so the instanced path is at feature parity with the flat
    path. The streamed mesh total counts both routes. Falls back to the flat-only path
    when the loaded wasm predates the partitioned export.

- [#1259](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1259) [`b125ae6`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b125ae60f0a7227ea42dfb0f95230e29c7f645ff) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix oversized, fragmented openings cut from walls rotated in plan ([#1167](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1167), "weird
  wall hole cutting").

  A vertical wall rotated in plan (a façade off the project grid, or a whole
  building rotated relative to the world axes) had its windows and doors cut
  wrong: the openings came out far larger than they should and the wall fragmented
  into rim slivers and cracks. On a real reporter model the worst wall lost 86% of
  its volume to five openings and came back with ~236 unpaired edges. Two causes,
  both from cutting a _tilted_ opening box in _world_ space:

  - The opening was routed onto the fast world-axis-aligned-AABB cut path whenever
    its extrusion direction sat within ~18° of a world axis (the
    `is_axis_aligned_direction` tolerance of 0.95). The AABB of a rotated box is
    strictly larger than the box — an oversized, grid-aligned hole.
  - Even via the exact mesh subtract, a tilted cut at large world coordinates
    (≈150 m, where f32 ≈ 15 µm) over-cuts and fragments.

  The tolerance is tightened to `cos(1°)`, and — the real fix — a plan-rotated
  wall is now cut in its own axis-aligned, origin-centred frame: the host and its
  openings are rotated into that frame (where they are world-axis-aligned and near
  the origin, so the exact subtract is clean and f32-precise), cut there (clean
  boxes take the watertight `rect_fast` path; brep/curved openings keep their
  mesh), then the result is rotated back. A rotated wall now cuts like a straight
  one — the right volume, watertight, no slivers — at any rotation angle. The path
  is tightly scoped to plan-rotated walls, so axis-aligned walls and
  roof/floor/sloped openings are untouched.

  Adds regression tests: `rotated_wall_opening_is_not_overcut` and
  `rotated_opening_cuts_clean_at_every_angle` (synthetic, 3–45°, clean and
  tessellated profiles), plus `rotated_wall_openings_not_overcut_or_fragmented`,
  pinned on a real `IfcWallStandardCase` isolated from the reporter's model (five
  openings, full placement chain) — 22.5 m³ over-cut + 236 unpaired edges before,
  ~13 m³ and watertight after.

- [#1258](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1258) [`7f5e543`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7f5e543fee7b8f92109bf1b581120f3571f1e445) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Give small, compute-bound IFC files more geometry workers on active-cooled
  (10+ core) machines. The per-core caps were tuned to a bandwidth ceiling
  measured on a >512 MB georef result, but small models (e.g. a 20 MB
  boolean-clipped steel file) are CPU-bound, not bandwidth-bound — the 3–4
  worker cap left most cores idle. Files ≤64 MB now scale to `cores-2` workers
  (memory budget and `?geomWorkers=N` override still apply).

### Minor Changes

- [#1242](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1242) [`fec82b9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/fec82b9f3eea3655f92413fce82387ddce2f9722) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add Rust-backed domain-format exporters. The new `ifc-lite-export` crate is the
  source of truth for Wavefront OBJ, glTF/GLB, CSV, JSON and JSON-LD (plus a
  native-only ara3d BOS/Parquet path). They are exposed via wasm
  (`exportObj`/`exportGlb`/`exportCsv`/`exportJson`/`exportJsonld`) and
  reachable from TypeScript through `GeometryProcessor.export*` and
  `IfcLiteBridge.export*`. Geometry exporters fold per-mesh RTC origin correctly (glTF
  emits it as a node translation, keeping f32 vertex precision at georef scale).

  STEP export also supports schema conversion (`IFC2X3`/`IFC4`/`IFC4X3`/`IFC5` entity-type
  renames + attribute trimming) and a mutation bridge — `exportStep` takes a `mutations_json`
  payload (`MutablePropertyView` attribute edits + property-set synthesis: new
  `IfcPropertySingleValue`/`IfcPropertySet`/`IfcRelDefinesByProperties` entities). New Rust exporters:
  **IFC5/IFCX** (`exportIfcx` — USD-style node graph: spatial hierarchy + classes + known
  IFC5 properties) and **Merged** (`exportMerged` — combine several models into one STEP,
  id-offset + project unification).

  The CLI `export` command gains `--format obj|gltf|glb|jsonld|step|ifcx` (Rust-backed;
  `--type`/`--storey`/`--where`/`--limit` act as the isolation set — for `step` the forward
  `#`-reference closure is added so a filtered export never dangles a reference; `--schema`
  converts entity types). The MCP `export_glb` tool is unstubbed, `export_ifcx` is unstubbed,
  and a new `export_obj` tool is added (all honour an optional `type` filter).

  Also makes the wasm geometry engine usable under Node: `IfcLiteBridge.init()` now reads
  the `.wasm` bytes itself when running in Node (whose `fetch()` cannot load `file://`),
  strictly Node-gated so the browser/worker path is unchanged. This additionally fixes
  headless `clash`/geometry commands that previously failed to initialize wasm in Node.

  The viewer's GLB export now assembles the binary in Rust over the meshes it already
  holds (`GeometryProcessor.exportGlbFromMeshes`, wasm `exportGlbFromMeshes`) instead of the
  TypeScript GLTFExporter — no re-meshing, and the per-element RTC origin rides a glTF node
  translation so georef-scale models keep vertex precision.

  **BREAKING (`@ifc-lite/export`):** `GLTFExporter`, `JSONLDExporter`, and `CSVExporter`
  (+ their option types) are removed — glTF/GLB, JSON-LD, and CSV are now produced in Rust. Use
  `GeometryProcessor.exportGlb` / `exportGlbFromMeshes`, `exportJsonld`, and
  `exportCsv(bytes, mode, …)` (mode ∈ `entities`|`properties`|`quantities`|`spatial`). All in-repo
  callers (viewer GLB / command-palette / mobile / location-map / main-toolbar CSV exports, LOD1
  generator) are migrated; the Rust CSV gained the spatial-hierarchy mode to match.

  assembles the KMZ archive (`doc.kml` + `model.glb`) and computes the IFC
  grid-north → KML heading, exposed via the wasm `exportKmz` binding and
  `GeometryProcessor.exportKmz`. The viewer's `buildKmz` is now a thin async caller
  (matching the OBJ/glTF/CSV pattern); the GLB it packages is already produced by the
  Rust GLB exporter. The archive uses a hand-rolled stored-ZIP writer so the wasm
  bundle pulls in no zip/deflate dependency.

  `ifc-lite export <file.ifc> --format hbjson` and `GeometryProcessor.exportHbjson(buffer, name)`
  produce a Honeybee-valid model: `IfcSpace` volumes become watertight, planar-faced Rooms
  (Floor / RoofCeiling / Wall) ready to load via `Model.from_hbjson` and run in Ladybug Tools /
  Pollination. `IfcWindow` and `IfcDoor` occurrences are placed as coplanar Apertures and Doors
  on the matching exterior walls. Rooms and openings are built analytically from extruded-area
  profiles (not the render mesh), so they are watertight by construction and wasm-safe.
  `IfcRailing` occurrences are emitted as shading `ShadeMesh` geometry, and `IfcMaterialLayerSet`
  build-ups become Honeybee opaque constructions (real layer names + thicknesses; thermal
  properties defaulted by material-name keyword, since IFC rarely carries them) assigned by face
  type. Shared interior walls are paired as `Surface` adjacencies so multi-zone energy models
  don't lose heat to ambient. Backed by a new pure-Rust `ifc-lite-export` crate (source of truth
  for CLI / SDK / wasm). Available in the viewer's export menu as "Export HBJSON (Energy Model)",
  on the CLI as `export --format hbjson`, and via the SDK as `bim.export.hbjson()` (delegated to a
  geometry-capable backend; the data-only SDK stays wasm-free).

  (e.g. the wasm thread aborting under memory pressure) fires an `ErrorEvent`
  with an empty `message`, so the pool reported the cryptic, unclassifiable
  "Geometry worker failed: undefined". It now synthesises a message from
  whatever the `ErrorEvent` carries (`filename:lineno`, or
  "worker terminated unexpectedly"), so the failure is human-readable and the

  one-off error.

  Content-affinity routing had deferred all job emission to the very end of the pre-pass — the per-job geometry-hash pass, plus the entity-index event being emitted last, left the geometry workers idle until the whole pre-pass finished. The pre-pass now ships the events workers gate on (entity-index + styles) and a small first job wave right after the scan, then runs affinity routing over the rest. On a ~50k-part model first-visible-geometry dropped from ~22s to ~12s with no change to total load time or geometry — the bulk keeps exact geometry-hash affinity; only the small first wave routes by element id.

  When the `ifc-lite_bg.wasm` binary fails to download (non-OK HTTP status, a cold
  CDN edge, a mid-deploy race, or a blocking proxy/antivirus), wasm-bindgen's
  streaming loader rethrows a cryptic `Failed to execute 'compile' on
'WebAssembly': HTTP status code is not ok`. The geometry and parser workers now
  retry `init()` once on such fetch/HTTP-shaped failures, and the viewer maps the
  failure to actionable guidance ("reload the page") instead of surfacing the raw
  TypeError. Captured exceptions are tagged with a stable `error_kind` for triage.

  `FacetedBrepProcessor` dispatched every shell's face triangulation through rayon `par_iter`, but real-world BReps are overwhelmingly tiny (6–50 faces of trivial tri/quad/convex fast-path geometry — e.g. Tekla steel detail parts), where the parallel fork-join dispatch costs far more than the work it parallelises. A serial path gated on a 64-face threshold avoids that overhead (and the nested-parallelism contention under the per-element worker pool); `par_iter` still runs for large shells. Output is byte-identical — `collect` preserves index order and each face's f32 result is unchanged.

  Measured native, byte-identical (strict mesh hash unchanged): a 48k-BRep structural model −16.6% geometry time, an architectural BRep-heavy model −37%. Scales with how many small shells a model has; the win is larger in the browser where the nested parallelism is more expensive.

- [#1184](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1184) [`4a649b0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/4a649b0ced07331e3f2306f8462c5ee354b004c8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Re-enable content-dedup on the production geometry paths with a cheap structural hash — it's now a net speedup on steel-heavy models instead of the slowdown that forced it off.

  Content-dedup (skip re-meshing structurally-identical representation items) was disabled in the previous release because its 128-bit structural key recursively decoded the _entire_ item subtree — every face, loop, and point — costing more than the meshing it saved. `item_signature` now hashes `IfcFacetedBrep` (the dominant type in Tekla steel exports, where thousands of geometrically identical plates and bolts each get their own representation) through the same cached byte-level fast paths the mesher uses, with zero `decode_by_id` per point. On a ~50k-part steel model the brep hash dropped from ~8 s to ~2 s — below the ~5 s of meshing it skips — flipping dedup from a 0.9× loss to a 1.3× win, with byte-identical geometry (0 fingerprint mismatches over 50k elements).

  Dedup is gated to the cheap (brep) types in `item_dedup_key`, so procedural-geometry models — the ones whose recursive hash cost more than it saved — skip the hash entirely and pay nothing. The separate `IfcMappedItem` instancing cache is unaffected.

- [#1177](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1177) [`f5901b8`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f5901b8c32d401d57c8d38bcc8d3b14b423a3784) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Default content-dedup OFF on the production geometry paths — it was making large-model loads slower, not faster.

  The item-level content-dedup (skip re-meshing structurally-identical representation items) builds its 128-bit structural key by recursively decoding the _entire_ item subtree (every face, loop, and point entity) with the general decoder — roughly 3.5× more work than the mesher's cached decode of the same item. On real models the hash therefore costs more than the meshing it skips: measured on two large structural models, loads were **20–30% slower** with dedup on (it only paid off at near-100% duplicate hit-rate). Gated both production batch paths (native rayon pool + wasm) behind `GeometryRouter::content_dedup_enabled()` (default `false`); geometry output is byte-identical. The separate `IfcMappedItem` instancing cache is unaffected. A follow-up will make the structural hash walk the cached fast paths so dedup can be re-enabled as a net win.

### Patch Changes

- [#1160](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1160) [`631511e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/631511eedb135ea8bfc7caf640edea8862b86a59) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Restore per-layer slicing of single-solid walls/slabs with an `IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage`. Slicing turns one solid into one coloured sub-mesh per material layer (geometry_id = the layer's `IfcMaterial`) so the build-up is visible in 3D. The "Merge Multilayer Walls" toggle now does what its label promises for these walls too — "render walls as one solid": with the toggle on, the layer index is not attached, so each wall stays a single swept solid instead of slicing into layers (off, the default, shows the layered build-up).

  The slicing kernel stayed intact, but [#874](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/874) (mesh-production unification) dropped the `set_material_layer_index` wiring from every pipeline, so the router's index was always `None` and `try_layered_sub_meshes` never fired — layered walls silently rendered as a plain single solid in the browser, native, and server paths. Re-wire it: build the `MaterialLayerIndex` once per load (cached on the IfcAPI for the streaming path, with a cheap substring bail-out so files with no layer set pay nothing) and attach it to every batch router. This also restores the "Merge Multilayer Walls" toggle for models whose sliceable walls carry their geometry as `IfcBuildingElementPart`s — the merged parent now actually draws its sliced solid instead of leaving a gap.

  2D section now shows the layers too. The section cutter carries each sub-mesh's colour onto its cut segments (CPU and GPU paths), and the polygon builder splits one entity's cut into a polygon per material colour — single-material elements still produce one colourless polygon, so their existing per-`ifcType` / per-entity fill is unchanged. When the viewer shows IFC materials, each sliced layer fills with its own `IfcMaterial` colour instead of one colour for the whole wall, and the layer divisions are drawn as outlines — matching the 3D build-up.

  Two follow-on robustness fixes:

  - **3D layer glitch (z-fighting).** Adjacent layer slabs share the parent wall's `expressId`, so the renderer's per-entity depth nudge (keyed on `entityId`) gave their coincident interior interface caps the SAME depth — under `cullMode: 'none'` + MSAA that z-fought into a flickering comb that read as "see inside / not solid". The shader now folds the per-draw `baseColor` into the depth-nudge hash; batches are keyed by colour, so abutting layers (distinct colours) land on distinct depths. Constant per draw, so flat faces stay flat and curved surfaces are unaffected.

  - **Cap watertightness on irregular profiles.** A layer slab's innermost cut is built by two successive plane clips; on a non-convex `IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef` the two passes deposit geometrically-coincident section vertices that differ by ~1 ULP. `cap_half_space_clip` welded by exact f32 bits, so those twins stayed separate, the boundary chain dead-ended and a cap sub-loop was silently dropped — leaving open edges (a hole you could see through and a section with no fill there). The cap now welds on a spatial grid tied to its on-plane tolerance, collapsing the twins so the loop closes. Single-plane callers (opening cuts) have no such twins and are unaffected.

  - **3D section cut read hollow.** The live 3D section cap (`Section2DOverlayRenderer`) filled each cut polygon with a naive convex fan over the outer ring only, ignoring holes — a long-standing KNOWN LIMITATION. On the concave cross-sections that arbitrary IFC profiles (and material-layer slabs) cut into, the fan inverts and leaves the cut face uncovered, so a sectioned wall read as a hollow shell. The fill now uses the renderer's existing hole-aware ear-clipping (the same one the annotation-fill path uses), so the cut face is solid. The cap also now honours a per-polygon colour: a material-layer wall fills each layer of its 3D section cut with that layer's `IfcMaterial` colour (matching the 3D solids and the 2D section), while single-material cuts keep the uniform cap style + hatch unchanged via a sentinel.

  - **Solid layered 3D walls via backface culling.** Rendering a material-layer wall as N thin coincident-faced layer solids made it shimmer / read as a hollow shell — adjacent layers' interface caps z-fight under the viewer's double-sided rendering (culling is globally off because general IFC winding is unreliable), and same-material adjacent layers can't be depth-separated. The layer slices DO have reliable outward winding, though, so they're now tagged `geometryClass` 3 and the renderer draws that class with a dedicated **backface-culling** pipeline: the build-up stays visible on the wall's faces and edges, but the interior coincident caps never rasterise, so the wall reads as a clean solid (and a section cut through it shows the interior material surface rather than a hollow shell). The 2D/section cut consumes the same class — it never culls — for its per-layer fills. Cache `FORMAT_VERSION` → 9 so stale caches re-mesh with the class-3 slices.

## 2.7.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1159](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1159) [`39e0f82`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/39e0f82558ec65dd574b6b4bfb2430f7abba346b) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add a `?geomWorkers=N` override for the geometry worker pool, and document the
  per-tier worker caps as a memory-bandwidth ceiling.

  The parallel geometry pool picks a worker count from a cores/memory heuristic.
  A `?geomWorkers=N` A/B sweep on a large (722 MB) georef model showed that, with
  the pure-Rust exact CSG kernel, geometry wall-time is bound by **memory
  bandwidth**, not CPU cores: 3→4→5 workers gave no geometry speedup (flat
  wall-time, higher peak memory) and progressively starved the co-running parser.
  So the existing caps are correct for this class of file and are left unchanged —
  only their rationale is updated in comments.

  The override (`?geomWorkers=N`, persisted to localStorage so it survives the
  reload a re-measure needs; `?geomWorkers=0`/`auto` clears it) lets a user measure
  their own host's optimum, since the bandwidth ceiling is hardware-specific. It is
  threaded to `computeWorkerCount`, which honours it but still clamps to the memory
  budget, so the knob can never OOM the tab. Geometry output is byte-identical
  across worker counts (verified in the wild: identical mesh count at 3 and 4
  workers) — the count only repartitions which worker meshes which disjoint,
  deterministic element slice.

- [#1169](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1169) [`2556677`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/25566773498f4761bb073e17b874e638208b7d13) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix the rectangular-opening fast path erasing whole walls on redundant voids.

  Some authoring tools bake an opening into the wall profile AND re-add it as a
  separate opening element whose box spans the entire wall (a double-encoded /
  redundant void). The exact CSG kernel treats such a cutter as a no-op (its faces
  are coplanar with the host, so the host is returned unchanged), but the analytic
  `rect_fast` path was cutting it literally — removing the entire wall and leaving
  the window floating in a giant void ([#1167](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1167)).

  `rect_fast` now detects any opening whose clamped box contains the whole host on
  all three axes and defers the element to the exact kernel, matching its
  behaviour. Genuine interior openings (a margin on any in-face axis) are
  unaffected and still cut analytically. Verified against ~1,500 void elements
  across 13 architectural models: the only fast-vs-exact divergence was this
  whole-wall case, now gone; every normal window already removed identical volume
  on both paths.

## 2.7.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1165](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1165) [`9d9bd66`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9d9bd6646db8c40c797fe22d6eb4d60ee963c38c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Render `IfcSweptDiskSolid` elements whose directrix is an `IfcTrimmedCurve` (or bare `IfcLine`) — straight reinforcing bars, rods, and similar steel (issue [#1164](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1164)).

  The 3D curve sampler had no `IfcLine` arm, so resolving a trimmed-line directrix returned "Unsupported curve type: IfcLine" and the swept-disk mesh collapsed to an empty mesh — the element silently failed to load. This is the common Tekla/IfcOpenShell encoding for a straight bar: `IfcSweptDiskSolid(IfcTrimmedCurve(IfcLine, 0., L, .PARAMETER.), r)`.

  The sampler now handles `IfcLine` directly and a trimmed `IfcLine` in full 3D, honoring Trim1/Trim2 (parameter or cartesian bounds) and SenseAgreement, so the directrix samples to its true `[start, end]` segment instead of erroring. The swept-disk processor also applies a solid's own `StartParam`/`EndParam` to a bare `IfcLine` directrix. The 2D curve path no longer errors on `IfcLine` either.

  The swept-disk mesh now also ships smooth per-vertex normals (computed in its small-coordinate directrix-local frame). It previously shipped empty normals, leaving consumers to recompute them from world-space f32 positions — which at a georef-scale placement (rebar at national-grid coordinates ~6 km from origin) cancel catastrophically into garbage normals, rendering the tube as a field of specular sparkles.

## 2.7.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1137](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1137) [`69e5425`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/69e5425e3d7586fcc2d44a33465806adc0ed53f8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Cap the cut face of unbounded `IfcHalfSpaceSolid` differences (gable roof-trims, mono-pitch eaves, Revit top-trims).

  The pure-Rust kernel consolidation ([#1024](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1024)) deleted the in-tree BSP kernel along with the polygon cap that closed the cross-section left by the fast plane-clip path, but kept that path for unbounded `IfcHalfSpaceSolid` operands. With no cap, every such clip produced an **open, inverted shell** (negative signed volume, dozens of open boundary edges) instead of a watertight solid — the roof-clipped wall rendered as a broken/spiky surface.

  The clip now re-closes the section: it chains the on-plane open boundary into loops, classifies them into outer rings and holes, triangulates each region with the kernel CDT, and winds the cap to face the removed side. If the boundary is non-manifold or does not close (a non-watertight host), it bails and leaves the output unchanged — never worse than before.

  On AC20-FZK-Haus the two roof-clipped upper walls go from `14 tris / −8.4 m³ / 16 open edges` to `20 tris / +2.06 m³ / 0 open edges`; void-cut walls are untouched.

- [#1135](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1135) [`bd585c7`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bd585c73de1f39db3c9aac168174012b98b79855) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Speed up the exact CSG kernel ~42% on boolean-heavy models (Tekla 170_KM: 22.0s → 12.8s of serial geometry), byte-identical — the sign / boolean / retriangulation determinism manifests and full geometry suite are unchanged. Four profile- and literature-driven optimizations (Attene "Indirect Predicates" §5.4, Shewchuk):

  - **BVH boolean classification** — `boolean_vids` scanned the _entire_ opposite operand per arrangement triangle (an exact ray-cast + an exact coincident-face probe). A median-split AABB BVH (conservative ray + band-radius point queries) prunes each to O(log N + hits); the parity/any-match results are order-independent, so the verdict is unchanged.
  - **Memoize `to_f64_pt`** — classification and the output map materialize the same heavily-shared conforming vertices many times; each interned point's f64 value is now computed once per arrangement.
  - **Cache interval lambdas in the seg×seg pre-pass** — the O(n²) crossing loop re-derived each endpoint's degree-4/7 LPI/TPI interval lambda on every `orient2d`; compute it once and run the crossing test straight from it, falling to the exact cascade only on a straddle.
  - **Materialize f64 from the cached lambda** — reuse the interner's already-cached I512 lambda instead of re-deriving it at I1024.

  The remaining cost is the conforming retriangulation (constrained Delaunay) and the exact predicate arithmetic itself — the genuine exact-CSG floor. The win grows with operand size and applies to every boolean-heavy model.

- [#1163](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1163) [`200681b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/200681ba17f162aaafaabf56c0723ddba693faf8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add an analytic fast path for rectangular openings, skipping the exact CSG kernel
  for the common case.

  The pure-Rust exact CSG kernel is at its single-threaded, memory-bandwidth-bound
  floor (it won't parallelise — adding geometry workers gives no speedup), and
  void-cutting is ~85-90% of load. The only remaining lever is doing _less_ exact
  CSG. `rect_fast` cuts axis-aligned rectangular openings through an axis-aligned
  box host (the dominant case: windows/doors in a straight wall) with a 3D cellular
  decomposition instead of the mesh-arrangement kernel: split the host box by every
  opening plane on all three axes, mark each cell solid/void, and emit the exposed
  faces. Watertight by construction (shared snapped grid vertices on the kernel's
  own `SNAP_GRID`), deterministic (FMA-free f64 → byte-identical native==wasm), and
  handles windows, doors (flush to an edge), recesses, notches, and overlapping
  openings uniformly.

  It is a pure optimization: any case it can't prove safe — non-box host (multi-
  layer / chamfered / diagonal walls), non-rectangular opening, or a near-edge
  feature whose grid lines would collapse at the host's f32 magnitude — defers to
  the exact kernel unchanged. `IFC_LITE_RECT_FAST=0` forces everything back to the
  exact path.

  Measured (dental*clinic, a box-wall-dominated building): ~94% of openings cut
  analytically, void-cut geometry time ~0.95 s → ~0.32 s (~3×), with 2% \_fewer*
  triangles (no bloat). Models with more multi-layer or diagonal walls fire less
  (those correctly defer).

  pre-pass now tags each job with an affinity key — the exact 128-bit hash of the
  element's representation geometry — and the parallel dispatcher routes all jobs
  sharing a key to the same worker. Combined with the per-worker geometry-dedup
  cache, each unique geometry is meshed once **per model** instead of once per
  worker, so the workers partition the unique meshing instead of replicating it.
  Restores fast loads on models exported without `IfcMappedItem` (e.g.
  structural-steel detailers that emit thousands of byte-identical parts): a 19.5 MB
  steel model drops from ~32 s to ≈ the dedup floor split across the worker pool.
  Falls back to the previous interleaved split when no affinity data is present.

### Patch Changes

- [#1121](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1121) [`33874e3`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/33874e3088c67f6dfe26666852bd80d6ac1dea71) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Stop boolean-heavy models still hanging at 95% after the per-boolean escalation budget ([#1109](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1109) follow-up).

  The deterministic per-boolean budget ([#1112](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1112)) bounded a _single_ boolean, but two holes kept dense models stalling past the geometry-stream watchdog:

  - **Overshoot.** The budget's `tripped()` check only fired at arrangement loop boundaries — once per triangle in the seam retriangulation. A single heavily-fragmented host face (a slab cut by 24-47 openings) inserts thousands of constraint points in _one_ `triangulate` call, so a boolean ran to **7.7M** escalations — ~4 minutes — between two checks before bailing. Profiled on a real model: one IFCSLAB took 243 s.
  - **Distributed cost.** An element with many openings runs one boolean _per_ opening, each well under the per-boolean cap, so none trips — yet the element's total exact work is huge and the geometry batch blows the stream watchdog.

  This adds a **per-element** escalation budget alongside the per-boolean one. `kernel::budget::begin_element()` (called once per element at the unified `produce_element_meshes` entry — native _and_ wasm) accumulates escalations across every boolean the element issues; when the element total crosses `DEFAULT_ELEMENT_CAP = 100_000` it degrades as a whole (remaining cuts bail to the [#635](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/635) AABB box-cut), instead of grinding. The kernel's per-point retriangulation and constraint-recovery loops now also check the budget, so a single boolean can no longer overshoot the cap by 15×.

  Still a **deterministic count**, accumulated in deterministic per-opening order on the element's single worker thread (the kernel has no internal rayon), so native and wasm degrade the _same_ element identically — the cross-target parity the kernel exists to guarantee is preserved. Calibrated against the model corpus: healthy per-element totals are p99 ≈ 13k escalations, so the 100k cap (~8× p99) never false-trips a legitimate cut. The cap engages only when an element scope is opened (the batch path); direct kernel/router callers, the server, and offline export stay unbounded via the existing `set_cap(None)` / `IFC_LITE_CSG_BUDGET=0` switch — so the pinned determinism manifests are unchanged.

  Measured on the profiling corpus (one boolean-heavy structural model): the worst element drops from 243 s to 2.9 s, and total serial geometry from minutes to ~28 s.

- [#1121](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1121) [`33874e3`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/33874e3088c67f6dfe26666852bd80d6ac1dea71) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Speed up the exact CSG kernel's constraint-recovery hot path on dense-opening models ([#1109](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1109)).

  Profiling the boolean-heavy slabs that hung the geometry stream showed the kernel spends ~80% of its time in constraint-recovery retriangulation — split between the channel-detection scan and the pocket earcut. Two parity-safe optimizations:

  - **Channel detection.** The per-segment O(tris) channel scan recomputed `orient(a,b,vertex)` for each triangle _edge_, but a triangle has only three vertices — so compute each vertex's side of the `(a,b)` line once and run the reciprocal edge-side test only for edges whose endpoints straddle it: ~3 exact predicates per triangle instead of up to 12. **Channel scan 9.6s → 2.9s (3.3×)** on the profiling corpus.
  - **Pocket earcut.** The ear-emptiness test ran an exact `strictly_outside` predicate for every other ring vertex. A conservative f64-AABB prefilter (the same widened-margin technique already used by `tri_aabb_disjoint`) skips the exact test for vertices provably outside the ear's AABB. This cuts the earcut's exact-predicate count on large pockets, which also lowers the per-element escalation count, so the [#1109](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1109) budget cuts more openings exactly before degrading.

  Both produce **byte-identical** output — they compute the same exact predicate signs, and the prefilter only skips vertices it proves are outside — so the pinned determinism manifests, snapshots, and native==wasm parity are unchanged. End-to-end on a boolean-heavy structural model (per-element budget on): 23.6s → 19.4s of serial geometry; the channel-detection raw speedup is 3.3× (the budget converts the remaining headroom into more openings cut exactly rather than pure wall-time).

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1112](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1112) [`d2086aa`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d2086aa0c5ab5e4d4f98cb25498f58a88c24443c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix the exact CSG kernel hanging at 95% on boolean-heavy models (issue [#1109](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1109)), without sacrificing the cross-target determinism the kernel exists to guarantee.

  The pure-Rust exact kernel ([#1024](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1024)) replaced Manifold + the legacy BSP port with one bit-deterministic kernel — the right call for server↔client parity (clients run a native Rust server _and_ the wasm viewer and need matching results). But the flip dropped Manifold's/BSP's operand cap, so a boolean-heavy model (Tekla half-space end-clips, Revit flush openings — full of near-coplanar faces) drives the exact predicate cascade off its interval filter on a huge fraction of predicates, climbing the fixed-width rungs (to ~1340 bits) and into BigRational with no safety valve. The geometry stream never finishes; the loader stalls at 95%.

  This adds a **deterministic** per-boolean budget: it counts interval-filter failures (every predicate that needs the expensive exact tier) and, when the count crosses a cap, bails the boolean to the un-cut host so the existing [#635](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/635) AABB box-cut fallback fires. The count is a pure function of the snap-grid operands, so the trip point is identical on native x86*64/aarch64 and wasm32 — the server and the browser degrade the \_same* hard element to the _same_ fallback. A wall-clock budget would have broken parity (fast native finishes the exact cut while slow wasm trips), so the metric is deliberately platform-independent.

  The cap (`budget::DEFAULT_CAP = 500_000`) is calibrated 33× above the worst healthy boolean measured across the model corpus (~15k exact evaluations), so it never false-trips a legitimate cut; healthy models are byte-identical (determinism manifests unchanged). `budget::set_cap(None)` (or `IFC_LITE_CSG_BUDGET=0`) lifts it for the server/offline-export profile where "exact but slow" is acceptable — one code path, two profiles, no kernel fork.

- [#1114](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1114) [`16d87f2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/16d87f201dfd7d4cba46bb43e0f4a44ccce717bb) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Per-element local frame: eliminate f32 "fan" corruption on building-scale and georeferenced models.

  When a mesh is stored at f32 precision while its vertices sit at building-scale world coordinates (a model whose extent reaches ~200 m from the coordinate origin), the f32 mantissa only resolves ~15 µm there, so vertices closer than one ULP collapse to the same value and the triangles joining them fan out as long needles across the model. Lowering the global RTC threshold is the wrong lever (it is reserved for >10 km federation re-basing), and a single global recentre still leaves the model genuinely spanning ~200 m.

  Each element's vertices are now stored RELATIVE to a per-element `MeshData.origin` (the f64 AABB centre, snapped to the kernel reconcile grid `1/65536 m`), so the f32 coordinates stay element-small and collapse-free at any building or georef scale; the world position is `origin + position`. The renderer reconstructs world space with a per-batch model-matrix translate around a single shared scene origin (so abutting elements in different colour batches stay bit-coincident with no seam z-fighting), and the selection-highlight / GPU-picker buffers replicate the batch's exact f32 path so highlights are bit-coincident with no depth bias. The local frame is ON for the wasm (viewer) path and opt-in for native/server, so determinism snapshots and server output stay absolute-coordinate byte-identical.

  Every world-space consumer of element geometry now folds `origin` (`world = origin + position`): camera/scene bounds, the CPU raycast + BVH narrow phase, snap detection, the section cutters (CPU + GPU), the BIM↔scan deviation BVH, the spatial index, clash (world-frame triangles fed to both the TS and Rust kernels), the glTF / IFC5 / Parquet exporters, the Cesium GLB overlay, the construction-projection outline + storey-band derivation, and the federation alignment / mesh-duplicate paths. `MeshData.origin` is serialized in the geometry cache (format version 6, which auto-heals stale entries). Position differences (normals, edge vectors, areas) are origin-invariant and unchanged.

  This composes with the sub-grid sliver hygiene pass: the local frame removes the f32-storage fans, and `Mesh::clean_degenerate` removes the sub-grid slivers the finer-grained CSG host emits.

### Patch Changes

- [#1108](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1108) [`4af01aa`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/4af01aabe1c669864c3c3d1757789d7de81beaec) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix curved / opening-dense wall hairline cracks (a watertightness guard on consolidation)

  `ClippingProcessor::consolidate_coplanar` re-triangulates each coplanar plane
  bucket of the exact-kernel cut output INDEPENDENTLY. On a curved/faceted or
  opening-dense host, a FLAT bucket whose boundary runs along the faceted surface
  (an opening reveal, a cap, a curved-wall rim) gets its boundary chorded by the
  i_overlay union + collinear simplify — dropping the facet-boundary vertices the
  abutting buckets keep. The result was open boundary edges + T-junctions at the
  cut seam: thin white horizontal hairline cracks that shimmer under double-sided
  rendering. The raw kernel output is watertight; only the post-kernel
  consolidation introduced the gaps (a 24-facet curved host cut by one opening went
  from 0 open edges raw to 9 after consolidation).

  The fix is a watertightness guard at the end of `consolidate_coplanar`: if
  consolidation INTRODUCED open boundary edges and the raw kernel mesh is the
  cleaner one overall (by open edges + spike triangles), return the raw mesh. The
  overwhelming majority of hosts consolidate watertight (count 0) and return
  immediately — byte-identical, so the determinism snapshots and the
  `indirect_sign_manifest` constant are unchanged (the exact kernel is untouched).
  Only genuinely-torn hosts fall back to raw.

  Result on ISSUE_068 (opening-dense school): curved-wall open boundary edges
  4973 → 2323 (-53%), with the worst walls (the curved reception counter) now
  watertight. Also fixes a latent cavity crack on the [#780](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/780) bath and ~110 latent
  open edges on the FZK-Haus gable walls (their `csg_quality` bar is updated from
  spike-free to watertight, since the visible defect was the cracks). A future
  seam-preserving consolidation should deliver both watertight AND sliver-free for
  the residual "both-outputs-imperfect" hosts.

  When a mesh is stored at f32 precision while its vertices sit at building-scale world coordinates (e.g. a model whose extent reaches ~220 m from the coordinate origin), the f32 mantissa only resolves ~15 µm there. Vertices closer together than one ULP round to the same — or near-same — f32 value, so the triangles joining them collapse into zero-area slivers; when the third vertex is far away the result is a long, thin triangle that visibly fans across the whole model.

  `Mesh::drop_degenerate_triangles` now runs in `build_mesh_data` — the single funnel every element `MeshData` passes through on both the native and WASM pipelines — and removes only unambiguously-degenerate triangles: a bit-identical f32 vertex pair (exact zero area) or an aspect ratio above 1e5. These slivers carry no area, so neighbouring triangles of the same face already cover the surface and the removal is visually lossless. On a 54 MB georeferenced building model this drops all 664 catastrophic fans (0.29% of triangles) with no change to the remaining geometry, no kernel-determinism impact (predicate-sign manifests unchanged), and the synthetic-coordinate correctness harness stays byte-identical. The complete fix (local-frame / tiled vertex storage that keeps the vertices distinct) is tracked separately; this is the backstop that keeps the viewer clean meanwhile.

  Walls carrying many openings (e.g. a curtain/window wall with 8-14 voids) stalled
  the streaming geometry load in WASM — one such element could block a worker for
  40-150 s, tripping the stream watchdog. Native processing of the same element was
  ~0.2 s; the gap is WASM's emulation of the exact kernel's wide-integer (i1024)
  predicates, amplified by two structural costs that this change removes:

  - **Opening-dense host refinement.** A window wall is usually two huge face
    triangles per side, so every void's intersection segments pile onto those few
    triangles. The exact arrangement then re-triangulates a single triangle carrying
    dozens of constraint segments (O(k²)), and — worse — the batched N-ary subtract
    leaves unrecovered constraints and degrades to the O(N²) sequential path
    (re-arranging the growing host once per opening). When a host has ≥ 8 openings we
    now pre-subdivide it (1-2 levels of uniform midpoint subdivision) so each
    triangle carries only a few segments and the batched cut recovers. `consolidate_
coplanar` re-triangulates each coplanar group afterwards, so the temporary
    interior vertices don't survive except where a hole boundary pins them.
  - **Conservative broadphase prefilters in the exact re-triangulation.** The three
    O(N²) exact-predicate scans (`insert_point` point-location, `enforce_constraint`'s
    collinear-vertex scan, `recover_subsegment`'s channel scan) now skip the exact
    test for vertices/triangles outside a generously-widened f64 AABB, and all-explicit
    `orient2d` triples use the fast adaptive Shewchuk predicate instead of the
    WASM-emulated i1024 lambda path. The margin dwarfs any f64/implicit-point error,
    so the exact predicate still decides every retained case — output is byte-identical
    on every platform.

  Net: the worst dense wall drops from ~150 s to ~30 s in WASM (10× on most), the
  model loads without stalling, and native cold-load is ~20 % faster overall. The
  refinement is gated to ≥ 8-opening hosts (absent from the snapshot fixtures), so
  the determinism corpus and committed snapshots are unchanged; the prefilters and
  Shewchuk path are byte-identical everywhere. Geometry suite 439/439 green.

  After the pure-Rust CSG kernel replaced Manifold ([#1024](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1024)), the pipeline no longer
  cleaned the degenerate output Manifold used to remove on import. Faceted breps,
  extrusion-profile walls and walls with openings could therefore render visible
  needle "spikes" and jagged silhouettes coming from zero-area / collinear sliver
  triangles (other viewers don't show them because they clean degenerates on import).

  `Mesh::clean_degenerate` now drops triangles whose perpendicular height is below the
  kernel's reconcile grid (1/65536 m ≈ 15.3 µm) — sub-resolution coincident-pair and
  collinear slivers that carry no area. It runs at every mesh-output chokepoint
  (per element, per sub-mesh, and on the void-cut output), so both wasm (viewer) and
  native (server) get identical output. Vertices and normals are left untouched, so
  flat shading / sharp creases are preserved and the result is bit-deterministic. On a
  large faceted-brep building this removes 100% of the genuine degenerate slivers for a
  ~1% triangle reduction with no performance cost.

- [#1099](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1099) [`02d5ba7`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/02d5ba76151bcab80595c8ea80e4046260be73e8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Geometry load-cost reductions for large models (follow-up to [#1097](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1097) profiling).

  Profiling the streaming geometry pipeline on large models (Holter 169 MB / 109 k meshes, bouwkundig 327 MB / 55 k meshes) showed the load is bound by per-element decode + mesh production, NOT by CSG (measured ~2 k / ~246 boolean ops — negligible), distribution, or tessellation. The following reduce redundant per-batch work without changing geometry output (wasm-contract 19/19, mesh counts identical):

  - **Cache the geometry-style maps per worker.** The style→RGBA map and the derived `GeometryStyleInfo` index were rebuilt from the session-constant wire arrays on every `processGeometryBatch` call (~18 M HashMap inserts each on a 140 k-styled model). They're now built once per worker, keyed by a cheap signature — a measured ~5 % wall-clock win.
  - **Fold the element-colour resolution into the main producer loop** instead of a separate pre-pass that re-decoded every job entity, and decode each entity once via the cached `Arc<DecodedEntity>` (no deep clone). Eliminates a full duplicate decode pass per batch.
  - **`MeshCollection.takeMesh`**: move the mesh out of the collection on the streaming read path instead of cloning all vertex buffers, then copying again to JS — one fewer full copy of positions/normals/indices per mesh.
  - **Load-time visibility filter** (`ProcessParallelOptions.visibilityFilter` / `globalThis.__IFC_LITE_VISIBILITY_FILTER`): skip geometry jobs for disabled types (spaces, annotations, type-library) at prepass generation so they're never decoded/meshed/uploaded. Toggling a type back on requires a reload.

The mid-stream stall deadline scaled with file size (MB), but the real silent window is the wall-time of one synchronous `processGeometryBatch` call, which tracks CSG density per job — uncorrelated with megabytes. A ~275 MB dense steel model (190k+ meshes) tripped its own `15s + MB*30 = 23s` deadline mid-stream.

  - The worker now sizes each `processGeometryBatch` call adaptively to a wall-time budget (`batch-sizing.ts`, default 8 s) instead of a fixed 512-job count, so the silent window stays bounded regardless of CSG density and heartbeats flow continuously. Tuned on the largest real models — measured **40% faster on a 986 MB / 14 M-entity / 231 k-mesh model (100.9 s → 72.5 s)** vs. an over-conservative small-batch cut, and at or faster than the previous fixed-batch behaviour on mid-size models. An optional `batchSizing` override (`ProcessParallelOptions.batchSizing` or the `globalThis.__IFC_LITE_BATCH_SIZING` hook) allows hardware-specific tuning.
  - The subsequent-batch watchdog deadline is now a fixed grace (40 s browser / 25 s desktop), decoupled from file size; the first-batch deadline still scales with size for the single-threaded pre-pass.
  - The binary-split recovery path emits a liveness heartbeat before recursing/re-initialising, and a recovery WASM re-init now replays the pre-built entity index instead of falling back to an O(file) re-scan, closing the secondary silent window.

  Closes the last plan-flagged float-filter hole on top of the interval-lambda filter: the 1-D ordering of tri-tri crossing points (`cmp_along`) went straight to the I512 tier then BigRational with no interval pre-filter. `interval::cmp_along` (a pure-f64 directed-rounding mirror of `fixed::cmp_along`) now runs first; `tritri.rs` falls to I512/BigRational only on a zero-straddle. Because the interval is outward-rounded (no FMA), a definite sign equals the exact sign and is bit-identical native==wasm==x86_64==aarch64 — manifest constant and snapshots unchanged. Cumulative with the interval-lambda filter: native geometry ~4.2s → ~2.8s.

- [#1105](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1105) [`e42b703`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e42b70324a9d5caab23257d52e96df0198d8caa9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Faster exact CSG kernel: cached f64 interval-lambda predicate filter (one canonical kernel).

  Stage 1 of migrating the exact predicate cascade off WASM-emulated wide-integer
  (I512) arithmetic toward the modern "spend the budget in the float filter" design
  (Cherchi/Attene). The exact kernel's hot re-triangulation predicates resolved via
  the cached I512 lambda determinant, which WASM emulates ~hundreds× slower than
  native's hardware path — on opening-dense models that bignum dominated worker CPU.

  The interner now caches a directed-rounding **f64 interval lambda** per point
  (alongside the existing I512 lambda). `orient2d_v`, `cmp_lex_v`, and the interner's
  dedup compare run a pure-f64 interval determinant from it FIRST, falling to the
  exact I512/BigRational tiers only on a genuine zero-straddle. Because the interval
  is outward-rounded (no FMA), a definite sign equals the exact sign and is
  bit-identical across native/wasm/x86_64/aarch64 — the `indirect_sign_manifest`
  constant and the geometry-correctness snapshots are unchanged (determinism
  preserved, no drift, no parallel path).

  Result on ISSUE_068 (opening-dense facade): native geometry 4.2s → 2.9s (−30%,
  benefits the server too), WASM load 46s → 41s. Byte-identical mesh output; full
  geometry suite green (53/53 binaries, manifest + snapshots unchanged). Follow-ups
  extend the same filter to the remaining bignum sites and add a float-expansion
  exact tier for the degenerate tail.

  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `IfcCreator` now generates spec-valid 128-bit GlobalIds via the canonical `@ifc-lite/encoding` encoder (previously ~94% of generated ids failed `isValidIfcGuid` and silently changed identity on guid→uuid→guid round-trips, e.g. in BCF).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: schema-downgrade `IFCPROXY` placeholders now carry spec-valid GlobalIds instead of synthetic `PROXY_…` markers.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser`: `extractLengthUnitScale` now mirrors the canonical Rust extractor when an `IfcMeasureWithUnit` ValueComponent is unreadable — defaults the value to 1.0 and still applies the UnitComponent SI-prefix instead of falling through to metres (property scaling can no longer desync from geometry scaling).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: removed the dead legacy worker protocol (`process`/`prepass`/`prepass-fast` messages) — the streaming protocol (`stream-start`/`stream-chunk`/`stream-end` + `prepass-streaming`) is the only path; the wasm `buildPrePassFast` export is gone. Streaming pre-pass loads now apply aggregate void propagation (window/door cuts on aggregated parts) in parity with one-shot loads and the server.
  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ProcessingStats` gains optional `total_csg_failures` / `products_with_failures` fields — the server now reports the same CSG failure diagnostics the browser console shows.

  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ServerConfig.token` sends `Authorization: Bearer` on every request (servers running `IFC_SERVER_API_TOKEN` were unreachable from the TS client); the `ParseResponse` / `ProcessingStats` / `MeshData` mirrors gain the optional fields the Rust server actually serves (`mesh_coordinate_space`, transforms, scan/lookup/preprocess timings, mesh metadata).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: the worker-pool converter now carries `shadingColor` across the worker boundary — GLB "Shading" export no longer degrades on the default (parallel) load path; dead legacy wasm bindings removed (`IfcAPI.parse`, `parseStreaming`, `scanRelevantEntitiesFastBytes`, `MeshCollection.localToWorld`).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: `assembleStepBytes` deduplicated into `step-serialization` (was copied byte-for-byte in the STEP and merged exporters).

  single clean-room exact-arithmetic kernel (Cherchi-style indirect predicates)
  that runs identically on native and wasm32 — bit-deterministic across x86_64,
  aarch64 and the browser, with no C++ toolchain in the build.

  No API changes — `processGeometryBatch` and the SDK surface are unchanged.
  Consumers see different (better) triangulations wherever booleans fire:
  openings, clippings and flush recesses now cut watertight through exactly
  coincident/coplanar faces instead of relying on perturbation epsilons, tilted
  flush cuts no longer leave boundary cracks or seam slivers, and deep
  clipping-chain cutters are unioned and subtracted in one arrangement. Geometry
  fingerprints (`geomHash`) for boolean-cut elements change accordingly; the
  compare-models flow is unaffected because both revisions hash in-session with

  Openings on tilted steel members (Tekla channels, tubes, I-beams, gusset plates)
  were cut by the analytic axis-aligned-box clip. The AABB of a tilted thin cutter
  is far larger than the authored cutter, so it over-cut — removing real section
  material and leaving a thin residual wall — and the analytic path also fabricates
  reveal/cap walls in the open profile. This was a project-wide error on every
  tilted member.

  Openings are now routed by a **type-independent geometric test**: when an
  opening's world AABB volume significantly exceeds its actual cutter-solid volume
  (i.e. the cutter is tilted or non-box), it is cut with its **real mesh** via the
  Manifold boolean — exact authored shape, no bounding-box inflation, and the
  kernel's perturbation clears coplanarity with the profile's inner faces/fillets.
  Axis-aligned box openings (AABB ≈ cutter) keep the cheap, deterministic analytic
  clip, so flat slab/wall openings stay stable on CI. Because the test is geometry-
  not type-based, it works regardless of how an exporter labels elements (incl.
  projects that model everything as IfcBuildingElementProxy).

  Also retunes the Manifold cutter perturbation to clear the kernel's host-relative
  coplanarity tolerance.

Unset / `'medium'` reproduces the engine's historical densities byte-for-byte, so existing consumers see no change; lower levels coarsen curved geometry for throughput, higher levels reduce faceting on pipes / cylinders / NURBS at a proportional triangle-count cost.

  The viewer mesh path (`processGeometryBatch`) now always emits an `IfcTypeProduct`'s `RepresentationMap` geometry, tagging each mesh with a `geometryClass`: `0` = occurrence, `1` = orphan type (no occurrence — buildingSMART annex-E showcase files), `2` = instanced type-library shape (a type linked to an occurrence via `IfcRelDefinesByType`). `MeshDataJs.geometryClass` (wasm) and `MeshData.geometryClass` (`@ifc-lite/geometry`) carry it across the boundary.

  The viewer's Visibility menu gains a Model/Types segmented control. **Model** (default) shows occurrences + orphan types and hides class‑2 type-library shapes — so the AC20/ArchiCAD "duplicate boxes at the wrong position" never appear. **Types** shows the type library (classes 1 + 2 at their map origins) and hides occurrences. The switch re-filters the cached mesh set instantly (no reload) and the choice persists across reloads.

  The native `process_geometry` path is unchanged — it still suppresses instanced-type geometry so server/CLI/SDK exports never duplicate it.

  each `MeshData.geometryHash` carries the hash (threaded through the streaming +
  parallel worker paths). This feeds the geometry side of the diff: a moved or

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

### Minor Changes

- [#962](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/962) [`778fc99`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/778fc9989fc44bf1be70b81d25a635da7e857719) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Render IFC surface textures on tessellated geometry ([#961](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/961)).

  `IfcBlobTexture` (embedded PNG **and** JPEG) and `IfcPixelTexture` (raw pixel
  literals) are now decoded to RGBA8 entirely in Rust (the `png` and
  `jpeg-decoder` crates) and the per-triangle `IfcIndexedTriangleTextureMap` /
  `IfcTextureVertexList` coordinates are emitted as per-vertex UVs in lockstep with
  the flat-shaded tessellation (the authored texture coordinates are used directly,
  mapping the image ~1:1 like the buildingSMART reference; the whole-shell
  orientation flip is mirrored onto the texture indices so UVs stay aligned). The
  decoded RGBA + UVs ride on `MeshData` across the wasm boundary; the WebGPU
  renderer gains a dedicated textured pipeline that uploads the texture and draws
  textured meshes in their own sub-pass, preserving picking, section-clipping and
  flat-shading. The buildingSMART annex-E "tessellated shape with style" boilers
  now render textured instead of flat white.

  All image/texture decoding lives in Rust so the server, CLI and SDK get the same
  result — the browser only uploads the bytes to the GPU. `IfcImageTexture`
  (external URL) remains out of scope (needs an async fetch resolver).

- [#966](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/966) [`773b508`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/773b5086456de3c61bdde8a72dd3d35325e2e995) Thanks [@Blogbotana](https://github.com/Blogbotana)! - feat(grids): expose structural grids (IfcGrid/IfcGridAxis) in the render frame ([#945](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/945))

  Resolve `IfcGridAxis` curves through the same placement + unit-scale + RTC
  pipeline the meshes use and emit them in the renderer's Y-up, RTC-subtracted,
  metres world frame, so structural grids overlay streamed geometry by
  construction (no viewer re-implements the placement resolver).

  - New WASM API `parseGridLines(content) -> Float32Array` (flat 3D line-list)
    and `parseGridAxes(content) -> GridAxisCollection` (structured per-axis
    `{ gridId, axisId, tag, start, end }`), mirroring `parseAlignmentLines`.
  - New `@ifc-lite/geometry` `GeometryProcessor.parseGridLines` /
    `parseGridAxes` (returns plain `GridAxis[]`) and a `GridAxis` type.
  - `CoordinateInfo` now also reports `lengthUnitScale` and populates
    `wasmRtcOffset` (the actually-applied RTC offset) directly from the geometry
    pipeline, so any consumer can map externally-resolved geometry into the
    render frame without viewer-side patching.

### Patch Changes

- [#973](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/973) [`f99666a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f99666ae028a88f1378422dd20900929f026cd2b) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - fix(geometry): union segmented-roof clip cutters to stop wall slivers and dropped walls ([#960](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/960))

  Gable walls trimmed by a segmented roof are authored as deep left-deep
  `IfcBooleanClippingResult(.DIFFERENCE., x, IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace)`
  chains (one cutter per roof plane). Two defects on House.ifc:

  - Walls clipped by 12+ roof planes blew the boolean recursion-depth limit and
    rendered as nothing.
  - Sequentially subtracting abutting roof-segment prisms left a zero-thickness,
    full-height fin on the shared seam — a thin wall sliver poking through the
    roof.

  The chain is now walked iteratively and the cutter prisms are combined with a
  true CSG union before a single subtract, so the seam face is dissolved and the
  depth limit no longer bites. Two guards keep the well-tested per-cutter path
  for full-cross-section clips (duplex.ifc "Party Wall") and reject any union the
  kernel silently under-removes. Output is mm-identical to IfcOpenShell on all
  five reported walls.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#889](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/889) [`32c2f01`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/32c2f014c668b97247d6cec236e53d1573201662) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Render `IfcAlignment` as a thin centerline **line** instead of a triangulated
  ribbon, matching how IfcGrid axes and IfcAnnotation curves draw.

  `IfcAlignment` carries its geometry in the `Axis` curve (`IfcAlignmentCurve` or
  `IfcPolyline`), not a `Representation`. Previously the streaming batch mesher
  routed it through the whole-element `IfcAlignmentProcessor`, which sampled the
  directrix into a thin solid ribbon strip — visually wrong for what is a
  centerline. Now the alignment is sampled straight into a line-list overlay:

  - **`@ifc-lite/wasm`** gains `IfcAPI.parseAlignmentLines(content)`, which walks
    every `IfcAlignment`, resolves its `Axis` directrix, samples the centerline
    (1 file-unit station spacing, adaptive cap at 5000 samples) and returns a flat
    `Float32Array` of 3D line-list vertices `[x0,y0,z0, x1,y1,z1, …]` in the
    renderer's Y-up, RTC-subtracted, metres world space — the same frame the mesh
    pipeline produces, so the line lands on the same ground as the terrain.
  - **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** surfaces it as `GeometryProcessor.parseAlignmentLines`.
  - **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** gains `uploadAlignmentLines3D` / `clearAlignmentLines3D`,
    drawing the centerline through the existing line pipeline (separate buffer).

  The batch mesher no longer special-cases `IfcAlignment` into the ribbon
  processor (reverted to the prior skip), so alignments are lines-only — never
  both. In the viewer the centerline renders whenever a model carries an
  alignment (no toggle).

  Regression coverage: `alignment_lines` unit tests in
  `rust/wasm-bindings/src/api/alignment_lines.rs` pin the contract — a planar
  polyline alignment emits an even-count line-list whose start maps to the
  renderer origin and whose extent matches the directrix, and a file with no
  alignment emits an empty array.

Each was verified against internal code, the other apps, the examples, the scaffolding templates, and the docs before removal.

  - **@ifc-lite/geometry**: drop `LODGenerator` / `LODConfig` / `LODMesh` (`lod.ts`), `DEFAULT_MATERIALS` / `getDefaultColor` / `getDefaultMaterialColor` / `MaterialColor` (`default-materials.ts`), and `calculateDynamicBatchSize`.
  - **@ifc-lite/parser**: drop `StyleExtractor` (and its `IFCMaterial` / `StyleMapping` types) and `OpfsSourceBuffer`.
  - **@ifc-lite/data**: drop `isBuildingLikeSpatialTypeName` — the enum-based `isBuildingLikeSpatialType` and the other spatial-type predicates stay.
  - **@ifc-lite/extensions**: drop `slugify` and `suggestedExtensionId`; the sibling id helpers (`suggestedCommandId`, `flavorImportedId`, `flavorMergedId`, `DEFAULT_FLAVOR_ID`) are retained.
  - **@ifc-lite/wasm**: drop the debug-only `debugProcessEntity953` / `debugProcessFirstWall` methods and the never-wired `scanEntityIndexShard` (Path C sharded-scan) export.

  Also removes the dead `ifc-lite-engine` crate (no workspace dependents) and the no-op `serde` feature on `ifc-lite-core` (it gated no code).

### Minor Changes

- [#688](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/688) [`d0ba541`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d0ba541dda3936b985c2189fbca4300cbb89df91) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add GLB export dialog with colour-source selection and visibility
  filtering (PR [#688](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/688)).

  The new `GLBExportDialog` in the viewer replaces the inline GLB
  export handler in `MainToolbar` with a dedicated dialog. Features:

  - **Model picker** for federated multi-model scenes.
  - **Colour source** selector: "Rendering" (the apparent display
    colour — `IfcSurfaceStyleRendering.DiffuseColour` if authored,
    falling back to `IfcSurfaceStyleShading.SurfaceColour`) or
    "Shading" (the raw `SurfaceColour`, only available when the file
    authored a distinct `DiffuseColour`).
  - **Visible-only filter** that respects the viewer's hidden /
    isolated entity sets. Mesh-vs-set comparison runs in global ID
    space so federated models with non-zero `idOffset` filter
    correctly.
  - **Metadata inclusion** toggle for IFC GlobalId / type / name
    side-tables.

  Pipeline changes underneath:

  - `MeshData` / `MeshDataJs` carry an optional `shadingColor`
    alongside `color`. The Rust styling module now extracts both
    `IfcSurfaceStyleRendering.DiffuseColour` (rendering) and
    `IfcSurfaceStyleShading.SurfaceColour` (shading) in a single
    pre-pass and returns them as separate maps; `shadingColor` is
    only populated when it actually differs from the rendering
    colour, so memory cost stays sparse on the common case.
  - The streaming geometry path
    (`convertMeshCollectionToBatch`) and the worker collector
    (`IfcLiteMeshCollector`) both copy `shadingColor` end-to-end so
    the dialog's "Shading" source works on every load path, not just
    the batch path.
  - `GLTFExporter` gains `colorSource`, `visibleOnly`,
    `hiddenEntityIds`, and `isolatedEntityIds` options. Visibility
    filtering compares mesh `expressId` (global) against the dialog-
    supplied sets (also global) — no offset arithmetic in the
    exporter.

### Patch Changes

- [#679](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/679) [`a376179`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/a376179aa40e3f8f8550cd449fd114d5f4939217) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix consumer build failure when bundling `@ifc-lite/geometry` without
  `@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded` installed (issue #676). The published
  `dist/geometry-controller.worker.js` used to carry a static
  `import init, { initSync, IfcAPI, initThreadPool } from '@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded'`
  which Turbopack / webpack / Vite all follow during worker chunking —
  the optional peer-dep flag added in #665 only suppresses `pnpm install`
  warnings, not bundler resolution. Consumers on Next 16 + Turbopack hit
  `Module not found: Can't resolve '@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded'`.

  The threaded bundle is intentionally workspace-only (see
  `packages/wasm-threaded/package.json` `_intent`; the production path
  uses the single-threaded `@ifc-lite/wasm` and the controller is kept as
  latent infrastructure per
  `docs/architecture/single-controller-rayon-design.md` §12). Resolution
  splits across build steps:

  - **Source** keeps the static `import … from '@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded'`
    so the workspace build (Vite alias →
    `packages/wasm-threaded/pkg/ifc-lite.js`) still resolves the
    controller-path opt-in correctly. Vite only honors aliases for
    statically-analyzable specifiers, and the viewer toggles the
    controller path via `localStorage['ifc-lite:single-controller']='1'`.
  - **Published dist** is post-processed by
    `scripts/transform-controller-worker-dist.mjs` after `tsc`. The
    transform replaces the static line with module-level `let` bindings
    plus a lazy `await import(<runtime-built-specifier>)` loader, and
    injects an `await __loadThreadedModule()` at the top of the `init`
    handler. Consumer bundlers no longer see `@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded` as
    a build-time dependency.

  A new `geometry-controller-dist.test.ts` regression test pins both
  halves of the contract — no static import in dist, and the lazy loader
  is present.

  root cause of #666 for geometry consumers — ESM workers are not Vite's
  default and the package can't ship around that) and add an optional
  `ProcessParallelOptions.wasmUrls` escape hatch so consumers whose
  bundler doesn't transform `new URL('ifc-lite_bg.wasm', import.meta.url)`
  inside the worker — or who serve the wasm from a different origin
  (CDN, Tauri custom protocol, etc.) — can pass an explicit URL. The
  workers forward it to wasm-bindgen's documented `init(url)` parameter.
  Default behaviour is unchanged: Vite + webpack 5 consumers who already
  worked continue to work without setting `wasmUrls`.

Previously published `@ifc-lite/geometry` manifests pointed at `@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded@0.1.0`, which is intentionally non-publishable, causing `npm install @ifc-lite/geometry` to fail. The threaded bundle is only imported by the single-controller worker behind a feature flag and is always supplied via a host bundler alias, so it now lives in `devDependencies` with an optional `peerDependency` documenting the alias contract.

## 1.18.2

### Patch Changes

- [#656](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/656) [`384efaa`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/384efaaaee45cd6f36d3a107899b3b4106143c9a) Thanks [@maxkrut](https://github.com/maxkrut)! - Reject overlapping WASM streaming geometry runs with a controlled JavaScript error before re-entering the processor.

- [#633](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/633) [`7b70805`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7b70805632627a6e4351b1735479be18390c8b21) Thanks [@maxkrut](https://github.com/maxkrut)! - Fix published worker URLs to reference the emitted JavaScript file.

  `@ifc-lite/geometry` starts parallel geometry processing by constructing
  module workers from `geometry-parallel`. The published npm package includes
  `dist/geometry.worker.js`, but `dist/geometry-parallel.js` still points at
  `./geometry.worker.ts`, so consumers can fail to load the worker at runtime.

  Keep source worker URLs pointing at TypeScript files for in-repo Vite builds,
  and extend the post-build rewrite so published `dist/index.js` and
  `dist/geometry-parallel.js` point at the emitted JavaScript worker files.

## 1.18.1

### Patch Changes

- [#644](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/644) [`6f052c3`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/6f052c309a99edd1d9a6925d44bbc2aed6cd10a5) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add "Merge Multilayer Walls" load-time toggle (issue #540).

  When enabled, every `IfcBuildingElementPart` whose `IfcRelAggregates`
  parent wall (a) has its own `Representation` and (b) is sliceable in
  `MaterialLayerIndex` is suppressed during geometry emission. The parent
  wall's single swept solid keeps the per-layer sub-mesh colouring via the
  existing slicer, so the visual result on multilayer walls is the same as
  the layered render — but with one mesh per wall instead of N per-layer
  parts. Designed for large Revit-exported models where the per-layer
  extrusions inflate vertex counts beyond what the viewer can handle.

  New JS surface on `IfcAPI`:

  ```ts
  setMergeLayers(enabled: boolean): void
  ```

  Defaults to `false`. Honoured by `parseMeshes`, `parseMeshesSubset`,
  `parseMeshesAsync`, `parseMeshesInstanced`, `parseMeshesInstancedAsync`,
  `processGeometryBatch`, and `processGeometryBatchParallel`. The batch
  paths cache the parts-to-skip set on `IfcAPI` so workers build it once
  per content and reuse across every batch; the cache is cleared by
  `clearPrePassCache` and by `setMergeLayers`.

  Voids stay correct: `propagate_voids_to_parts` already copies the
  parent wall's `IfcRelVoidsElement` references onto its layer parts in
  the same pass that builds the part → parent map, so windows and doors
  still cut through the merged solid.

  inside a dedicated `WorkerParser` worker that shares the source bytes via
  `SharedArrayBuffer` with the existing geometry workers. Parse and geometry
  streaming run in parallel without contending for main-thread time, cutting
  upload-to-interactive wall-clock by roughly 2× on medium-to-large files.

  New public APIs:

  - `@ifc-lite/parser`

    - `WorkerParser` (browser-only, exported from `@ifc-lite/parser/browser`)
    - `data-store-transport`: `toTransport(store)` / `fromTransport(payload, source)`
      plus the `DataStoreTransport` payload type. Lets any consumer ship a
      fully-typed `IfcDataStore` across a `postMessage` boundary with the
      typed-array buffers in the transfer list and closures rebuilt on receipt.

  - `@ifc-lite/data`

    - `entityTableFromColumns` / `entityTableToColumns`
    - `propertyTableFromColumns` / `propertyTableToColumns`
    - `quantityTableFromColumns` / `quantityTableToColumns`
    - `relationshipGraphFromColumns` / `relationshipGraphToColumns`
    - `relationshipEdgesFromColumns`, `relationshipGraphFromEdges`, `buildCSR`
    - `StringTable.fromArray(strings)`
    - `EntityTable.rawTypeName` is now exposed (optional column) so the
      unknown-type display fallback round-trips through column transports.

  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`

    - `processParallel(buffer, coordinator, sharedRtcOffset?, existingSab?, options?)`:
      `existingSab` lets the geometry workers reuse a SAB the caller already
      populated. The new fifth argument is `ProcessParallelOptions` with:
      - `onEntityIndex(ids, starts, lengths)`: invoked once the streaming
        pre-pass has built the entity index. Hosts forward the SAB-shared
        columns to `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex(...)` so the parser skips
        its own ~10 s WASM scan.
      - `useSingleController`: opt-in (off by default) to the experimental
        single-controller + wasm-bindgen-rayon path. See
        `docs/architecture/single-controller-rayon-design.md` §12 for the
        post-mortem on when this helps and when it regresses.
    - `GeometryProcessor.processParallel` and `processAdaptive` accept the
      same options to plumb them through.
    - `StreamingGeometryEvent` gains a `workerMemory` variant carrying
      per-worker WASM heap + mesh-byte counts for memory accounting.

  - `@ifc-lite/parser` (additions on top of the worker entry above)
    - `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex(ids, starts, lengths)`: hand a pre-built
      entity index to the worker's `IfcAPI`. Pairs with the geometry
      pre-pass's `onEntityIndex` callback above.
    - `WorkerParserOptions.waitForEntityIndex`: when true, the worker blocks
      its WASM scan until `setEntityIndex` arrives (60 s watchdog falls
      back to the regular scan if it never does).
    - `IfcParser.parseColumnar`: signature widened to accept
      `ArrayBuffer | SharedArrayBuffer` (was `ArrayBuffer`); the SAB-backed
      parser worker no longer needs an `as unknown as ArrayBuffer` cast.

  The viewer auto-falls back to the in-process `IfcParser` when
  `crossOriginIsolated` is `false` or the worker spawn throws, so behavior is
  unchanged in environments without SAB.

### Patch Changes

- [#637](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/637) [`2334993`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2334993827839b9f5b96ca8008c49543fb597660) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `Could not resolve entry module "geometry.worker.ts"` when bundling the
  published `@ifc-lite/geometry` package with Vite/Rollup.

  `src/geometry-parallel.ts` constructs module workers via
  `new Worker(new URL('./geometry.worker.ts', import.meta.url), ...)`. The post-
  build step in `package.json` rewrites those `.ts` URLs to `.js` so the npm
  tarball ships URLs that point at the emitted file — but the rewrite was only
  applied to `dist/index.js`, and the worker URLs live in `dist/geometry-parallel.js`.
  Consumers like the `create-ifc-lite` Vite templates therefore tried to load a
  `.ts` worker entry that is not present in the tarball and the build failed.

  Apply the rewrite to every `.js` file in `dist/`, leaving the source TypeScript
  URL unchanged so in-repo Vite builds keep resolving the worker from source.

- [#641](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/641) [`ba7553a`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/ba7553af693939896a840074999b5f6806a94815) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `IfcReinforcingBar` stirrup rendering (issue #631, sample
  `IfcReinforcingBar.ifc`).

  `IfcSweptDiskSolid` directrixes that use `IfcIndexedPolyCurve` over
  `IfcCartesianPointList3D` (typical for stirrups and other bent rebar that
  lives outside the XY plane) used to fall back to a 2D parser that read x/y
  from indices 0–1 and silently dropped the Z coordinate. The stirrup
  collapsed onto z=0 and the resulting tube was a flat near-degenerate line.

  The 3D curve dispatcher now has a native arm for `IfcIndexedPolyCurve` that
  reads `IfcCartesianPointList2D` (z=0) or `IfcCartesianPointList3D` verbatim
  and fits `IfcArcIndex` segments using a circumcircle in the plane of their
  three control points. Straight schema conformance — no spec deviation.

  The second sample on the issue (`Rebar2.ifc`) was already rendering its
  directrix correctly under the existing segment-index trim path; no change
  needed there.

### Patch Changes

- [#630](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/630) [`5439cce`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/5439cce34edaff1c050ce8975a330163167df6fd) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Render `IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered` (issue #628).

  Tapered extrusions (e.g. beams or columns whose cross-section transitions
  between a `SweptArea` profile at the base and an `EndSweptArea` profile at
  `Depth`) were recognised by the parser but silently skipped by the geometry
  engine, so the elements never appeared in the viewer.

  The Rust geometry crate now ships:

  - `extrude_profile_lofted` in `extrusion.rs` — generates caps from each
    profile's own triangulation and stitches the side walls 1:1, resampling
    the shorter outer loop by arc length when authoring tools emit profiles
    with mismatched vertex counts. Side normals are computed from the actual
    3D quad so sloped faces shade correctly.
  - `ExtrudedAreaSolidTaperedProcessor` registered alongside the existing
    `ExtrudedAreaSolidProcessor`. Falls back to a uniform extrusion if
    `EndSweptArea` is missing so malformed files still render.
  - `IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered` is now accepted by `profile_extractor`
    (used by 2D drawing projection) and the `IfcMappedItem` dispatcher.

  Out of scope for this patch and called out for follow-up:
  `IfcRevolvedAreaSolidTapered`, plus tapered solids participating in
  `IfcBooleanClippingResult` / openings / material-layer slicing.

### Minor Changes

  pointcloud samples (`pcd::base64`, `points::array`, `points::base64`).

  - New `@ifc-lite/pointcloud` package: renderer-agnostic decoders for PCD
    (ASCII / binary / binary_compressed via inline LZF) and the two inline
    IFCx point schemas. Pure TS, no three.js, no WebGPU.
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry` adds `PointCloudAsset` and `GeometryResult.pointClouds`.
  - `@ifc-lite/ifcx` adds `extractPointClouds()` and surfaces decoded scans
    on `IfcxParseResult.pointClouds`. The mesh extractor is unchanged.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser` re-exports the new `PointCloudExtraction` type.
  - `@ifc-lite/renderer` gains a WGSL `topology: 'point-list'` pipeline,
    per-asset GPU buffers, and `Renderer.setPointClouds()` /
    `Renderer.addPointClouds()`. Points share the depth buffer and section
    plane state with the triangle pipeline.

### Patch Changes

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Address CodeRabbit + Codex review feedback on PR #608.

  Critical visual / correctness fixes:

  - Point splats rendered ~2× too large because the shader treated the
    user-facing `pointSizePx` (diameter) as the splat radius. Fixed in
    both the live splat shader and the picker shader so click targets
    match the rendered disc.
  - Routed every detected point-cloud format (`ply`, `pcd`, `e57`) through
    the streaming ingest in both `useIfcLoader` (single-file drop) and
    `useIfcFederation` (multi-file). Previously only `las/laz` got the
    pointcloud branch; `ply/pcd/e57` fell through into the IFC STEP path.
  - Federation: applied `idOffset` to `geometryResult.pointClouds` too so
    multi-pointcloud-model loads don't collide on local `expressId`.
  - `expressId` defaulted to `1` on every ingest, so multiple inline LAS
    loads collided. Now uses a process-local synthetic counter.
  - E57 integer color channels are commonly u16 (0..65535); reader was
    forcing u8 reads, distorting RGB. Now picks element width from the
    declared min/max range.
  - PCD `applyStride` preserved positions + colors but dropped intensity
    and classification, so those color modes silently broke on files
    past the 25M-point downsample cap.
  - Inline `uploadAssetToGpu` forwards `intensities` + `classifications`
    (added to `PointCloudAsset.chunk` shape).
  - Model bounds recomputed after `removePointCloudAsset` /
    `clearPointClouds` — previously stayed oversized, breaking
    fit-to-view and section sliders.
  - `usePointCloudLifecycle` disposes a model's GPU asset when the model
    stays in the store but its `pointCloudHandleId` changes (re-stream of
    the same file used to leak the old handle).
  - `resetViewerState` now clears the point-cloud slice runtime fields so
    loading a new file doesn't inherit the previous file's color mode /
    size / EDL state.

  Correctness / robustness:

  - `streamPointCloud`'s host now closes the source on probe + onOpen
    failures (single try/finally wrapping the whole open-and-decode
    flow), so worker-backed sources don't leak the decoder on parse
    errors or aborts.
  - `worker-client.close()` clears cached `info`; subsequent `open()`
    actually re-opens instead of returning stale info next to a null
    `sourceId`.
  - `LasStreamingSource.open()` and `LazStreamingSource.open()` are
    atomic on failure: state is committed only after every step
    succeeds, so a retry rerruns the probe + RGB-scale detection
    cleanly. LAZ also frees malloc'd wasm pointers in the catch path.
  - PLY decoder rejects files where `vertex` isn't the first element
    (decoder reads from `header.bodyOffset`; non-leading vertex would
    silently produce garbage).
  - `decodePointsArray` validates each `colors[i]` is a `[r,g,b]` triple
    before indexing, so malformed schemas fail with a clear message.
  - `useIfcLoader` LAS/LAZ/PLY/PCD/E57 branch is guarded by
    `loadSessionRef` on both error and success paths so a newer load can
    replace an in-flight one without overwriting the newer model state;
    stale renderer handle is freed.

  Critical webhook fixes:

  - `ViewportOverlays.tsx` had three imports between executable code;
    hoisted them above the `const isDesktop = isTauri()` declaration.
  - `edl-pass.ts` used `0u` for `texture_depth_multisampled_2d`'s
    `sample_index`; WGSL spec requires `i32`.
  - `pcd.test.ts` switched from `__dirname` to
    `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` so it works outside vitest's
    CommonJS-compat shim.

  UX polish:

  - `PointCloudPanel` toggle buttons expose `aria-pressed` so screen
    readers announce the active option.
  - `pointCloudSlice` setters reject `NaN`/`Infinity` (Math.min/max
    passes them through unchanged).
  - `BlobByteSource.read` clamps a negative `start` to `0`.
  - File-dialog filters split GLB out of the IFC bucket into a "Mesh
    Files" group.

  The flattenMatrix transpose flagged in the review is actually correct
  for USD's row-major-with-translation-in-row-3 convention (verified by
  inspecting the Point_Cloud_S1 sample's transform; the rendered scan is
  at the right world position). Added a clarifying comment so future
  reviewers don't reach for the wrong fix.

### Patch Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

  **BREAKING**: Rename `isGeoReferenced` to `hasLargeCoordinates` in CoordinateInfo interface.
  Large coordinates do NOT mean a model is georeferenced. Proper georeferencing uses IfcMapConversion.

  - Rename isGeoReferenced → hasLargeCoordinates across all packages (geometry, cache, export, viewer)
  - Fix transform_mesh to apply RTC uniformly per-mesh (not per-vertex) preventing mixed coordinates
  - Fix coordinate-handler.ts threshold consistency between bounds calculation and vertex cleanup
  - Fix streaming path originalBounds reconstruction by undoing server-applied shift
  - Surface RTC offset in GpuGeometry struct with JS-accessible getters (rtcOffsetX/Y/Z, hasRtcOffset)
  - Add RTC detection and offset handling to parseToGpuGeometryAsync
  - Include RTC offset in GPU async completion stats
  - Add comprehensive coordinate handling documentation

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f4fbf8c: ### New Features

  - **2D Profile-Level Boolean Operations**: Implemented efficient 2D polygon boolean operations for void subtraction at the profile level before extrusion. This provides 10-25x performance improvement over 3D CSG operations for most openings and produces cleaner geometry with fewer degenerate triangles.

  - **Void Analysis and Classification**: Added intelligent void classification system that distinguishes between coplanar voids (can be handled efficiently in 2D) and non-planar voids (require 3D CSG). This enables optimal processing strategy selection.

  - **Enhanced Void Handling**: Improved void subtraction in extrusions with support for both full-depth and partial-depth voids, including segmented extrusion for complex void configurations.

  ### Improvements

  - **WASM Compatibility**: Replaced `clipper2` (C++ dependency) with `i_overlay` (pure Rust) for WASM builds, eliminating C++ compilation issues and ensuring reliable WASM builds.

  - **Performance**: Profile-level void subtraction is significantly faster than 3D CSG operations, especially for floors/slabs with many penetrations.

- f4fbf8c: ### New Features

  - **Type visibility controls**: Toggle visibility of spatial elements (IfcSpace, IfcOpeningElement, IfcSite) in the viewer toolbar
  - **Enhanced CSG operations**: Improved boolean geometry operations using the `csgrs` library for better performance and accuracy
  - **Full IFC4X3 schema support**: Migrated to generated schema with all 876 IFC4X3 types

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed unit conversion**: Files using millimeters (.MILLI. prefix) now render at correct scale instead of 1000x too large
  - **Fixed IFCPROJECT detection**: Now scans entire file to find IFCPROJECT instead of only first 100 entities, fixing issues with large IFC files

- ed8f77b: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Lite Parsing Mode**: Added optimized parsing mode for large files (>100MB) with 5-10x faster parsing performance
  - **On-Demand Property Extraction**: Implemented on-demand property extraction for instant property access, eliminating upfront table building overhead
  - **Fast Semicolon Scanner**: Added high-performance semicolon-based scanner for faster large file processing
  - **Single-Pass Data Extraction**: Optimized to single-pass data extraction for improved parsing speed
  - **Async Yields**: Added async yields during data parsing to prevent UI blocking

  ### New Features

  - **On-Demand Parsing Mode**: Consolidated to single on-demand parsing mode for better memory efficiency
  - **Targeted Spatial Parsing**: Added targeted spatial parsing in lite mode for efficient hierarchy building

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed Relationship Graph**: Added DefinesByProperties to relationship graph in lite mode
  - **Fixed On-Demand Maps**: Improved forward relationship lookup for rebuilding on-demand maps
  - **Fixed Property Extraction**: Restored on-demand property extraction when loading from cache

- f7133a3: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Zero-copy WASM memory to WebGPU upload**: Implemented direct memory access from WASM linear memory to WebGPU buffers, eliminating intermediate JavaScript copies. This provides 60-70% reduction in peak RAM usage and 40-50% faster geometry-to-GPU pipeline.

  - **Optimized cache and spatial hierarchy**: Eliminated O(n²) lookups in cache and spatial hierarchy builder, implemented instant cache lookup with larger batches, and optimized batch streaming for better performance.

  - **Parallelized data model parsing**: Added parallel processing for data model parsing and streaming of cached geometry with deferred hash computation and yielding before heavy decode operations.

  ### New Features

  - **Zero-copy benchmark suite**: Added comprehensive benchmark suite to measure zero-copy performance improvements and identify bottlenecks.

  - **GPU geometry API**: Added new GPU-ready geometry API with pre-interleaved vertex data, pre-converted coordinates, and pointer-based direct WASM memory access.

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed O(n²) batch recreation**: Eliminated inefficient batch recreation in zero-copy streaming pipeline.
