# @ifc-lite/geometry

Streaming geometry processor for IFClite. Converts IFC bytes to renderable mesh batches via Rust + WASM (or Tauri native), with first triangles in 300–500ms and progressive streaming for large models.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ifc-lite/geometry
```

## Process geometry from IFC bytes

```typescript
import { GeometryProcessor } from '@ifc-lite/geometry';

const processor = new GeometryProcessor();
await processor.init();

const buffer = new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer());
const result = await processor.process(buffer);

console.log(`${result.meshes.length} meshes, ${result.totalTriangles} triangles`);
// Each mesh: { expressId, positions: Float32Array, normals, indices: Uint32Array, color, ifcType }
```

## Stream geometry (recommended for large models)

```typescript
const buffer = new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer());

for await (const event of processor.processStreaming(buffer)) {
  if (event.type === 'batch') {
    renderer.addMeshes(event.meshes, true);
    console.log(`Loaded ${event.totalSoFar} meshes so far`);
  } else if (event.type === 'complete') {
    console.log(`Done: ${event.totalMeshes} meshes`);
  }
}
```

The streaming path emits batches every ~100 meshes so the renderer can paint progressively — first triangles typically arrive 300–500ms after `processStreaming()` returns.

## Tessellation quality

Curved geometry (swept pipes, cylinders, fillets, NURBS) is approximated with straight segments; the detail level is selectable per processor:

```typescript
// 'lowest' | 'low' | 'medium' (default) | 'high' | 'highest'
const processor = new GeometryProcessor({ tessellationQuality: 'high' });
// or at runtime, before processing:
processor.setTessellationQuality('low');
```

Unset / `'medium'` reproduces the engine's historical densities byte-for-byte. Lower levels coarsen curved surfaces (×0.5 / ×0.25 segment density) for throughput; higher levels refine them (×2 / ×4) to reduce visible faceting, with a proportional triangle-count and processing-time cost on curved-heavy models. Profile circles (opening cutters / extruded caps) never get finer than `'medium'`. Applies to the WASM paths (main-thread, streaming, worker pool); the native Tauri path does not consume it yet. See the [Geometry Guide](https://ifclite.dev/docs/guide/geometry/) for the full level table.

## Coordinate handling

```typescript
const buffer = new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer());
const result = await processor.process(buffer);

// Models with large world coordinates (geo-referenced) get auto-shifted
// to keep float precision inside the renderer.
if (result.coordinateInfo?.hasLargeCoordinates) {
  const { x, y, z } = result.coordinateInfo.originShift;
  console.log(`Origin shifted by [${x}, ${y}, ${z}] for renderer precision`);
}
```

The mesh pre-pass also publishes its exact IFC Z-up, metre-based `RtcFrame` as
`coordinateInfo.wasmRtcFrame`. Pass that frame to auxiliary parsers for the
same loaded model so grids, alignments, and symbolic geometry use the mesh
origin exactly:

```typescript
const bytes = new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer());
const loaded = await processor.process(bytes);
const frame = loaded.coordinateInfo.wasmRtcFrame;
const gridLines = processor.parseGridLines(bytes, frame);
const alignmentLines = processor.parseAlignmentLines(bytes, frame);
const symbols = processor.parseSymbolicRepresentations(bytes, frame);
try {
  console.log(gridLines?.length, alignmentLines?.length, symbols?.totalCount);
} finally {
  symbols?.free(); // WASM-owned collection; typed arrays need no cleanup
}
```

`needsShift: false` is an authoritative decision to subtract nothing, even if
the frame's inactive `x`/`y`/`z` values are non-zero. It disables only RTC
subtraction; the parser's documented unit scaling and IFC Z-up to renderer
Y-up output conversion are unchanged. An absent
`wasmRtcFrame` means the producer did not publish frame provenance (for example,
the native bridge); it does not mean `needsShift: false`. Omitting the parser
argument retains standalone whole-source detection. That is useful for an
independent IFC source, but it can differ from a streaming pre-pass's sampled
frame or a federation-wide shared frame, so loaded-model overlays should use
the published frame when present.

## Vite setup

The geometry workers ship as ESM and use the standard
`new Worker(new URL('./geometry.worker.js', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })`
spawn pattern. Vite's default `worker.format: 'iife'` setting can't host
ESM workers, so consumers need one config line:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  worker: { format: 'es' },
});
```

This is the same contract that Mapbox-GL, Three.js, Cesium, and Monaco
require — ESM workers are not the Vite default, but they are the modern
standard and the pattern wasm-bindgen produces by default.

If your bundler can't transform
`new URL('ifc-lite_bg.wasm', import.meta.url)` inside the worker bundle
(or you serve the wasm from a CDN at a separate origin), pass explicit
wasm URLs through the `processAdaptive` / `processParallel` `wasmUrls`
option:

<!-- Reason: Vite-only `?url` import specifier, unresolvable by tsc. -->
<!-- docs-check: skip -->
```ts
// Vite's `?url` suffix yields a fully-resolved URL string at build time.
// `@ifc-lite/wasm` exposes the binary at the `./ifc-lite_bg.wasm` subpath
// so this resolves cleanly through the package's `exports` map.
import wasmUrl from '@ifc-lite/wasm/ifc-lite_bg.wasm?url';

for await (const event of processor.processAdaptive(buffer, {
  wasmUrls: { wasm: wasmUrl },
})) { /* ... */ }
```

The worker forwards the URL to wasm-bindgen's documented `init(url)`
parameter, bypassing the default `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`
resolution inside the worker entirely. For webpack 5 use
`new URL('@ifc-lite/wasm/ifc-lite_bg.wasm', import.meta.url).href`;
for other bundlers, any string the runtime can resolve to the binary
works.

## Performance

- **First triangles:** 300–500ms (streaming path)
- **Correctness:** exact-arithmetic boolean kernel - openings are cut exactly, verified element-by-element against IfcOpenShell on the public benchmark corpus
- **Worker support:** files > 50 MB process off-main-thread automatically
- **Native (Tauri):** `preferNative: true` enables the native Rust pipeline when running under a Tauri host — an extension point for third parties building their own desktop app (`@tauri-apps/api` is an optional dep; web builds never load it). See the [Building for Desktop](https://ifclite.dev/docs/guide/desktop/) guide.
