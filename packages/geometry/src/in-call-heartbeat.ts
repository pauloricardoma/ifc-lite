/**
 * Heartbeat from INSIDE one synchronous geometry batch call.
 *
 * The worker used to be able to speak only between WASM calls, so a single
 * slow element (tens of seconds on a wall with hundreds of curved openings)
 * looked exactly like a hung call. The pool's hung-call recovery then replaced
 * the worker after 45 s and skipped the element after 90 s more, so whether
 * the element appeared depended on the user's CPU speed: the same file loaded
 * with different geometry on different machines, and the replay alone added
 * 45 s plus a full re-run of the element.
 *
 * The geometry kernel now reports progress at coarse points of every long
 * path (`ifc_lite_geometry::progress`); the WASM binding rate-limits that to
 * at most one callback a second. This module turns those callbacks into the
 * worker's existing liveness message, but only while a geometry batch call is
 * running, so nothing else the worker does (pre-pass, style resolution) emits
 * a geometry-call heartbeat. A call that stops reporting is still recovered
 * by the pool exactly as before.
