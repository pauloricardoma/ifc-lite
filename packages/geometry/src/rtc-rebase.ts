/**
 * Moving already-loaded models onto the federation's RTC anchor (#4897).
 *
 * A model with small coordinates gets no `wasmRtcOffset` at load and is meshed
 * raw. When a model that needs a real RTC anchor joins the federation, that
 * anchor becomes the shared frame (`chooseSharedRtcOffset`, `world-frame.ts`),
 * so every model meshed before it — and any model that finished loading in
 * parallel against a different frame — has to move onto it, or it renders in a
 * frame nothing else shares.
 *
 * This is a plain axis-aligned translation, not a CRS reprojection: both
 * anchors are metres in the same IFC axes, so there is no rotation or unit
 * conversion to apply.
 *
 * PRECISION. The translation goes into each mesh's f64 `origin`, never into its
 * f32 `positions`. The delta is the anchor itself when a raw model moves, i.e.
 * map-coordinate magnitude (Swiss LV95 ~2.6e6 m, UTM northings ~5e6 m), where
 * one f32 ULP is 0.25-0.5 m: baking it into the vertices collapses millimetre
 * detail to zero. Moving the origin keeps `positions` bit-identical and leaves
 * the mesh in exactly the shape the wasm mesher produces when the anchor was
 * already known at load (f64 origin = element centre minus the RTC, small f32
 * local detail), so both load orders render from the same kind of data.
