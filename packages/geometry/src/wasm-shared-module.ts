/**
 * ONE compiled `WebAssembly.Module` per binary per session, shared by every
 * consumer of the geometry engine in this realm.
 *
 * Two independent code paths need the ~3.9 MB engine binary and used to fetch
 * and compile it separately:
 *   - the N-worker pool (`geometry-parallel.ts`), which structured-clones a
 *     compiled module to each worker (#1818 — before that, N parallel compiles
 *     of a multi-MB module contended on the CPU and produced a multi-second
 *     "WASM ready" stagger before any geometry was meshed);
 *   - the main-thread `IfcLiteBridge.init()` path, used by the adaptive sync
 *     route for small files and by the export/bridge APIs, which calls
 *     wasm-bindgen `init()` and lets IT fetch + compile.
 *
 * Keeping the memo here — rather than private to the worker pool — means the
 * second path can reuse whatever the first already compiled, so the binary is
 * fetched at most once per URL per realm no matter which path runs first. That
 * matters most when the two overlap: a prewarm started at page load and a small
 * file opened seconds later would otherwise be two concurrent downloads of the
 * same 1.3 MB (browsers are not required to coalesce in-flight requests for the
 * same URL), on exactly the slow connections the prewarm exists to help.

 * slow link the whole download sits in front of first geometry (measured 2.5 s
 * on a ~4 Mbit connection, for a 225 KB model).
 *
 * Fire-and-forget by design: a prewarm failure must never surface to the user or
 * poison the load path. `compileSharedWasmModule` already evicts a failed URL so
 * the real load retries, and every consumer falls back to its own `init()` when
 * no shared module is available. Callers decide *when* to call this (idle,
 * intent) and whether the connection can afford it.
 *

 * resolution, which is the intended usage.
