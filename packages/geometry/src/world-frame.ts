/**
 * Render frame <-> IFC world coordinates: the one implementation (#4879).
 *
 * Meshes out of this package are NOT in the file's own coordinates. The wasm
 * mesh pass subtracts an RTC offset (`CoordinateInfo.wasmRtcOffset`, IFC
 * Z-up) and `CoordinateHandler` may subtract a further origin shift
 * (`CoordinateInfo.originShift`, already in the Y-up mesh axes), both to keep
 * f32 precision usable for georeferenced models. Everything read off those
 * meshes (renderer camera, section plane, entity and clash bounds) is in that
 * shifted, Y-up "render frame". Anything written for another tool (BCF
 * viewpoints above all) has to be in IFC world coordinates, Z-up.
 *
 * The viewer, the CLI, the MCP playground and the SDK all need the same
 * answer, so the axis swap and the offset sum live here, next to the
 * `CoordinateInfo` they read, rather than once per consumer.
 * `scripts/check-rtc-frame-copies.mjs` keeps it that way.

 * earliest-loaded model with any `coordinateInfo` answer (every model is then
 * raw). The federation loader converges every other meshed model onto that
 * same anchor after each load (`rtc-rebase.ts`, via the viewer's
 * `federationRtcRebase.ts`), so in either load order this returns the frame the
 * geometry is actually in. The earlier "earliest model with any
 * `coordinateInfo`" rule reported a near-origin model's raw frame whenever it
 * was loaded first, including for a raw point cloud, which never joins the
 * RTC frame.
 *
 * Models whose `loadState` is `pending`, `streaming-geometry` or `error` are
 * only considered when no settled model has a frame. The same set the
 * convergence treats as settled: until such a load settles the other models
 * have not been converged onto its anchor, so the settled frame stays the
 * reported one.
 *
 * `fallback` covers a single model loaded without a federation entry. Null
 * when nothing has geometry. The one case where the geometry does NOT all
 * match is a GPU-instanced model the loader could not move; the viewer
 * reports that to the user instead of leaving it silent.
