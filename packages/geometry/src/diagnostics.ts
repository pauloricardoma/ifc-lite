/**
 * Public CSG / opening diagnostics contract for @ifc-lite/geometry. The shape
 * mirrors the Rust `GeometryDiagnostics` (rust/geometry router::diagnostics),
 * which is built once per geometry batch and serialized to a JS object. The
 * geometry worker merges per-batch values across batches and the parallel loader
 * merges across workers, surfacing one `diagnostics` object on the streaming
 * `complete` event. The native `ProcessingStats` path reuses the same
 * aggregator (wired: `rust/processing` populates `geometry_diagnostics`).
 *
 * Counts are best-effort observability: `totalCsgFailures` and the classification
 * counts are exact, while `productsWithFailures` / `hostsWithOpenings` /
 * `silentNoOps` are summed per batch and are therefore upper bounds (a product
 * whose geometry spans batches may be counted more than once).

   * `0` is what Rust's `#[serde(default)]` yields when it READS a payload
   * written before #1514, and is the only "pre-versioned producer" signal a
