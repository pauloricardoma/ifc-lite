/**
 * Classify WebAssembly runtime traps and, for the one case that genuinely
 * cannot be recovered in-document, broadcast it so the host can offer a reload
 * (#1898).
 *
 * A trap is what reaches JS when the engine executes `unreachable`: with
 * `panic = "abort"` (rust/Cargo.toml) a Rust panic, a failed `assert!` and an
 * allocator abort are ALL indistinguishable from here — see the same caveat in
 * `huge-file-error.ts`. What a trap can damage is bounded: the wasm instance's
 * linear memory keeps whatever the aborted call leaked, and any Rust state the
 * call was mutating is left mid-flight. It does NOT invalidate the module, and
 * it says nothing about other engine handles in the realm, let alone about
 * other realms (each Worker instantiates its own `@ifc-lite/wasm`).
 *
 * So the recovery contract is:
 *
 *  - a trap taken inside an *operation* is the caller's failure. The bridge
 *    that took it drops (and frees) its `IfcAPI` handle — that is where the
 *    wedgeable per-load caches live — and the original trap propagates
 *    unchanged. A later `init()`, on that bridge or any other, builds a fresh
 *    handle and works.
 *  - a trap taken while *initializing* means this realm could not produce a
 *    working engine at all, and neither half of that is retryable in practice:
 *    if the trap came from `new IfcAPI()` the module singleton is already built
 *    and wasm-bindgen's `init()` will keep returning it, and if it came from
 *    instantiation itself it is a deterministic module-level failure that
 *    recurs. That is the only case that earns
 *    {@link WASM_RUNTIME_UNRECOVERABLE_EVENT} — the user is told to reload,
 *    which is the one thing that really does get a new instance.
 *
 * Even then nothing is latched: a later `init()` still tries, so the
 * "unrecoverable" verdict is a diagnosis for the user, never a lock that could
 * disable an unrelated consumer. Recovery is lazy — it happens on the next
 * `init()` a consumer asks for — so there is no retry loop to bound either.
 *
 * Detection lives here as a pure, unit-testable predicate; the host app owns
 * the reload policy and subscribes to the event. This library never reloads
 * the page on its own — same division of labour as `wasm-asset-error.ts`.
 */

/**
 * Stable marker in the message of the error thrown when the engine cannot be
 * initialized after a trap. Kept in the message (not only in a field) so it
 * survives the string-only round trip through error tracking, and so the host
 * app can classify it without importing this package.
