/**
 * Multi-worker parallel geometry processing with streaming pre-pass.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   1. Spawn a single "pre-pass" worker that runs the WASM streaming
 *      scanner. The scanner walks the file once and emits:
 *        - `meta`     once, when RTC + unit are resolved (~1-2 % of scan)
 *        - `jobs`     repeatedly, every ~50 K entities
 *        - `complete` once, when the scan finishes
 *   2. On `meta`: spawn N geometry process workers (memory-budget-aware
 *      count) and send each a `stream-start` so they hold the metadata
 *      before any chunk arrives.
 *   3. On each `jobs` chunk: round-robin the chunk to a worker via
 *      `stream-chunk`. Workers process and emit `batch` messages.
 *   4. On `complete`: send `stream-end` to each worker so they emit
 *      their final `batch`/`memory`/`complete`.
 *
 * Net effect for a 1 GB file: time-to-first-batch drops from ~17 s
 * (full pre-pass + worker spawn + first batch) to ~3-5 s (pre-pass
 * scans first 100 K bytes → meta → first chunk → first batch).
