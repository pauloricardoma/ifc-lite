/**
 * #2527 follow-up: pins that `geometry.worker.ts` itself reads + consumes
 * ITS OWN realm's wasm panic-location stash and includes it on the
 * `{type:'error'}` message it posts back to the main thread — the half of
 * the fix `geometry-parallel-panic-forward.test.ts` cannot see, since that
 * fixture drives `processParallel` with a fully synthetic `Worker` and never
 * runs a line of this file.
 *
 * `geometry.worker.ts` assigns `self.onmessage = ...` at module scope, which
 * needs a `self` global — absent under vitest's default Node environment.
 * A minimal `self`/`postMessage` polyfill is installed BEFORE the dynamic
 * import so the module loads exactly as it would in a real worker realm.
