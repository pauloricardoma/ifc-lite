/**
 * World-frame corpus coverage for the contact pipeline (#2600, fix PR #2661).
 *
 * `scaledPlaneEps` (narrow-phase.ts) sizes the coplanarity tolerance from the
 * max |coordinate| over ALL THREE axes of both AABBs, then compares it
 * against a signed distance along ONE plane normal. A model 10 km out in X
 * therefore hands a Z-normal test a ~2.4 mm epsilon derived entirely from
 * the irrelevant X magnitude — and a genuine ~2 mm Z-clearance reads as
 * coplanar contact. The corpus places the SAME pair at the origin and far
 * out on an ORTHOGONAL axis; a frame-correct tolerance answers identically.
 *
 * Shape conforms to PR #2661's measured reproduction (`clearanceQuadsAt`):
 * horizontal quads with the lower plane at z = 0, offset applied to X only,
 * clearance above any legitimate Z noise yet INSIDE the default broad-phase
 * inflation, so all 2x2 candidate pairs are emitted and the verdict rests on
 * `planeEps` ALONE. One deliberate deviation: the corpus bakes coordinates
 * through f32 (ingestion realism), and f32(0.002) lands a hair ABOVE the
 * default 2 mm inflation — which would silently drop the candidates — so
 * the clearance here is 1.9 mm, robustly inside the inflation and still
 * comfortably swallowed by the defective ~2.4 mm far-placement epsilon.
 *
 * The clash contact `Mesh` has NO RTC-origin field (positions are world-
 * frame by contract), so this file carries only the large-world-coordinate
 * axis of the corpus; the per-element `MeshData.origin` axis lives in the
 * viewer compare tests (#2529 path).
 *
 * The far-offset case asserted the CORRECT behaviour while the #2600 defect
 * was live, so it was written as `it.fails`. #2661 landed the projection fix,
 * that test started passing, vitest reported the `.fails` wrapper itself as a
 * failure, and the wrapper was removed. The corpus cannot silently rot in
 * either direction, which is exactly what this round-trip demonstrated.
