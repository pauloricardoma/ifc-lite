/**
 * Thrown by {@link runClash} when a `tolerance` — either the run-level
 * `ClashSettings.tolerance` or a per-rule `ClashRule.tolerance` — is not a
 * finite number (`NaN`, `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`).
 *
 * `??` (the substitution `runClash` uses for an omitted tolerance) only
 * triggers on `null`/`undefined`, not `NaN`, so a `NaN` tolerance — e.g. from
 * `Number('')`/`Number('abc')` on a cleared UI input, or a unit-conversion
 * division by zero upstream — used to sail through unchanged. It then poisons
 * `Math.max(tolerance, rule.clearance ?? 0)` (`NaN` on any `Math.max` operand
 * is always `NaN`), which poisons the broad-phase AABB inflation
 * (`inflate(bounds, NaN)`), which fails every BVH overlap comparison, which
 * yields zero candidate pairs — silently, with the run still reporting
 * `classifyRuleCoverage() === 'clean'` because `matchedA`/`matchedB` are
 * selector-match counts taken before any geometry ran (#4244). Rejecting the
 * non-finite value at the door, before it can reach `Math.max`, makes that
 * whole chain structurally unreachable rather than merely harder to trigger.
 *
 * A NEGATIVE finite tolerance is unaffected by this check and keeps its
 * existing, correct behaviour: `Math.max(tolerance, clearance ?? 0)` clamps
 * it to at least the clearance (or zero), same as before.
