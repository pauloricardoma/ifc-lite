   * took over from `maxPenetrationInto`, removed in PR #2536 because a

   * that converges to 0 under retessellation rather than to the true
   * penetration depth; see `crossingVertexPenetration`'s own doc comment for
   * why that underestimation is harmless for a floor test and disqualifying
   * for a depth. Beyond that client it is a genuinely exact, independently
   * tested primitive (see the shared probe fixture in `tri-mesh.test.ts` /
   * `kernel_tests.rs`). Driven by the triangle BVH rather than a linear scan
   * so it stays cheap. The BVH is used through a plain `queryAABB`, so the
   * value is still the exact global minimum:
   *
   * TODO(remove-by: `crossingVertexPenetration` stops needing a
   * point-to-surface distance for the contained-pair floor test, or on
   * maintainer request; owner @BIMvoice): tracking issue
   * https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2646.
   *
   * 1. Query the cube of half-size `h` centred on `p`. Every triangle within
   *    distance `h` of `p` has its closest point inside that cube, hence its
   *    AABB intersects the cube, hence it is in the candidate set.
   * 2. If the candidate minimum `d` satisfies `d <= h`, the true minimum is
   *    `<= h` too, so its triangle was a candidate and `d` IS the true minimum.
   * 3. Otherwise `d` is still an upper bound on the true minimum, so one more
   *    query at half-size `d` provably captures the closest triangle.
   *
   * The reported value is therefore the same minimum the linear scan returns —
   * `min` selects an element, it does not accumulate, so visiting a superset of
   * the argmin in a different order returns the identical `f64`. The Rust
   * `distance_to_surface` runs the identical sequence of queries on the identical
   * BVH, so the two kernels stay bit-identical to each other (see the shared
   * probe fixture in `tri-mesh.test.ts` / `kernel_tests.rs`).
   *
   * The `wider.length === 0` arm below is unreachable, not a tested fallback:
   * `cubeAround(p, d)` with `d > h` strictly contains `cubeAround(p, h)`, whose
   * query was already non-empty, so every triangle that made `hits` non-empty
   * also intersects the wider cube — `wider` cannot come back empty. It is kept
   * only as defence-in-depth against a future `queryTris` regression, not as a
   * code path with coverage; do not read it as a tested safety net.
