/**
 * Format-independent logic shared by `adapters/step.ts` and `adapters/ifcx.ts`.
 *
 * Both adapters turn a source-specific representation into `ClashElement`s,
 * and both need the SAME two things done to get there correctly:
 *
 * 1. Drop non-physical / container classes before they become clash
 *    candidates (openings, spaces, grids, materials, type objects, and
 *    spatial containers whose geometry encloses — rather than physically
 *    touches — what it contains). (#1464 and its follow-up.)
 * 2. Coalesce every mesh belonging to one durable entity into exactly ONE
 *    `ClashElement`, so an entity with multiple representations (e.g.
 *    Body + Axis) never aliases into several clash candidates that share
 *    one identity.
 *
 * Both are expressed purely in terms of IFC class names / merged geometry
 * buffers — nothing here is STEP- or IFCX-specific. `elementsFromIfcx`'s
 * `tag` is the real IFC class code (`bsi::ifc::class`) or the resolved
 * entity-table type name, so it is spelled identically to `node.type` on the
 * STEP side (`IfcWall`, `IfcSpace`, `IfcOpeningElement`, ...) — verified by
 * `ifcx.ts`'s `resolveTag`. There is nothing format-specific to branch on, so
 * this lives in ONE place both adapters call instead of two copies that can
 * (and did) drift apart.
 *
 * `isSpatialContainerTag` needs `@ifc-lite/parser`'s schema-union inheritance
 * walk to catch IFC4.3 leaves (IfcRoad, IfcBridge, ...) that are not in any
 * hand-maintained list — the exact gap the original #1464 follow-up closed
 * for STEP. `@ifc-lite/parser` is already a full dependency of
 * `@ifc-lite/clash` (see package.json), so importing it here does not add a
 * new package to the graph; it only makes explicit, in the file that needs
 * it, a dependency the package already carries. `elementsFromIfcx`'s own
 * module doc describes the CORE clash engine as representation- and
 * parser-neutral — that claim is about `engine.ts`/`types.ts`, not about this
 * filtering utility, which is allowed to lean on the schema registry both
 * formats already agree on.
