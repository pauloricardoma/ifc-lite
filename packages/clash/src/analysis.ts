 * thinks about it: how deep the overlap is, whether a "clash" is really just a
 * face/edge contact, and which conflicts to look at first.
 *
 * Severity itself is a property of the *element-type pair* (see
 * {@link inferClashSeverity}), NOT of the overlap geometry — so a deep pipe-vs-
 * beam interpenetration and a shallow one share a severity. These helpers add
 * the geometric dimension (depth) so the two can be combined when prioritising.

 * from the origin (a `Clash`'s own coordinate magnitude — see below — decides

 * a slab) can pick up more than `1e-4` of pure rounding noise in its measured
 * penetration depth, and the fixed band then misses it, letting it reappear
 * as a hard clash in a list the user asked to de-noise.
 *
 * `Clash` carries no element bounds (that lives on `ClashElement`, not on the
 * detection result), but it does carry `bounds` — the contact/overlap region
 * itself, in the same world coordinates as the elements — so that is the
 * scale source: the max absolute coordinate over the clash's own contact
 * box. Floored at {@link TOUCHING_EPSILON} (not the raw single-unit f32
 * floor `precisionFloor` uses) so a clash near the origin gets exactly the
