/**
 * Duplicate / fully-overlapping element detection (#1280).
 *
 * The first thing people do when reviewing a single discipline model is hunt for
 * accidentally duplicated or coincident objects — re-imported geometry, a wall
 * pasted twice, a column modelled on top of another. That is *not* a discipline
 * clash, so it gets its own lightweight pass: AABB proximity decides *what* is
 * reported, and a tessellation-invariant shape signature (surface area +
 * enclosed volume) decides only whether a reported pair is labelled an exact
 * duplicate. No narrow-phase triangle-vs-triangle work. The broad phase is a
 * one-axis sort-and-sweep, which handles mixed-scale models correctly (no grid
 * cell size to mis-tune), so it is cheap enough to run on every load; the
 * signature is computed lazily, only for pairs that already coincide. Matching
 * on AABBs has a known limit for nested solids — see the "nested-solids limit"
 * section on {@link findDuplicates} for exactly what it can and cannot tell
 * apart.
 *
 * "Same object" is decided by {@link boxDistance} against `positionTolerance`, a
 * plain distance in metres. It used to be AABB intersection-over-union ≥ 0.9,
 * which is a ratio and so carried no physical tolerance at all: the same setting
 * allowed 5 mm across a DN100 pipe and 421 mm across an 8 m slab (see
 * `DuplicateOptions.iouThreshold`).
 *
 * Output is a normal {@link ClashResult} (rule id `duplicates`) so the existing
 * panel, grouping and BCF export render it with no special-casing. It is
 * *pairwise*: N coincident copies of one object yield N(N−1)/2 clashes. For a
 * reader-facing list use `groupDuplicateSets`, which collapses those pairs into
 * one finding per coincident set.

/**
 * Find duplicate / fully-overlapping elements. Returns a {@link ClashResult}
 * where each clash is a near-coincident pair. `settings.tolerance` is
 * `positionTolerance`, the value that actually decided the matches.
 *
 * Severity says exactly this much:
 * - `major` — some pair of the two elements' boxes coincides within
 *   `exactTolerance` **and** the two elements' meshes — summed over the
 *   several parts a multi-material / CSG element emits — agree to within 5% on
 *   both surface area and enclosed volume. Read it as "the same object, in the
 *   same place"; it survives one copy being re-tessellated, and it does not
 *   depend on which of a multi-part element's part pairings the sweep visited
 *   first.
 * - `minor` — near-coincident, but something differs: the boxes are further
 *   apart than `exactTolerance`, the shapes disagree, or one element carries no
 *   measurable geometry.
 *
 * What `major` still cannot tell you: the signature is two scalars over the
 * surface, so two genuinely different solids that happen to agree in both area
 * and volume to within 5% are indistinguishable here, as are an element and its
 * mirror image.
 *
 * ## The nested-solids limit
 *
 * Matching remains AABB-only, so an element nested inside another — a pipe in a
 * sleeve, a duct in a shaft, an assembly and the envelope drawn round it — is,
 * in principle, something this pass cannot tell from a duplicate. Two gates
 * already narrow that to a documented residual, and `duplicates.test.ts` pins
 * each case:
 *
 * - Nesting has clearance, and {@link boxDistance} measures clearance. Anything
 *   looser than ~7 mm of annulus is more than `positionTolerance` away and is
 *   never reported at all: a DN100 pipe in a DN125 sleeve is 17.7 mm away, a
 *   400×300 duct in a 500×400 shaft is 70.7 mm.
 * - Tighter nesting *is* reported, but only ever as `minor`. Reaching `major`
 *   additionally requires the two meshes to agree on surface area and enclosed
 *   volume within 5%, which distinct solids sharing a box do not: a 50 mm and a
 *   55 mm tube are 9.1% / 17.4% apart, a railing and its envelope box 73.2% /
 *   88.4%.
 *
 * So the residual is exactly this: a pair nested within a few millimetres is
 * listed as a `minor` candidate overlap. That is the intended reading of
 * `minor` — "these two coincide, and this pass will not claim they are the same
 * object" — and a reviewer still sees it, which for a coincidence hunt is the
 * safe direction.
 *
 * Measured across five public models (duplex, AC20-FZK-Haus, Office_A_20110811,
 * dental_clinic, Infra-Bridge), *no* reported pair was a nested one: all 33
 * findings are same-type pairs of equal bounds, and the count of nested or
 * cross-type pairs stays 0 even at a 250 mm tolerance, 25× the default. Note
 * what that does not cover — none of the five carries pipe or duct segments, so
 * the pipe-in-sleeve case is evidenced only by the constructed fixtures above.
 *
 * Closing the residual would need a narrow phase, which this pass deliberately
 * does not run, and the cheap substitutes are worse rather than merely weaker.
 * An area-weighted centroid plus surface inertia — the obvious candidate, and
 * the same O(triangles) cost as the signature (3.6 ms vs 2.6 ms over
 * dental_clinic's 236,795 triangles) — discriminates *less* on every nested
 * case measured, contributes nothing at all when the nesting is concentric
 * (identical centroids for pipe-in-sleeve and pipe-plus-insulation), and is not
 * tessellation-invariant: it reads 39.6% apart on one box against a finer
 * triangulation of the same box, which would break the exact-duplicate case
 * this signature exists to keep together. A voxel occupancy sample would
 * separate nested from coincident, but it needs a cell size — reintroducing the
 * scale-dependent knob that replacing the IoU gate removed.
