/**
 * Explicit MEMBERSHIP for a rule's A / B set.
 *
 * `ClashRule.a` / `.b` are type-name selectors, and a `ClashElement` carries
 * nothing but its type (`tag`), name and storey — so a selector cannot express
 * "walls whose `Pset_WallCommon.IsExternal` is true". A caller that DOES have
 * the model (the viewer resolves its advanced filter against the parsed store)
 * resolves such a set to element identities and hands them over as
 * `membersA` / `membersB`; the engine then partitions by membership instead of
 * by the selector, and everything downstream — severity, exclusions, dedup,
 * coverage, both kernels — is untouched.
 *
 * The identity is `(model, ref)`, not `key`. `ref` is what a caller holding a
 * `(modelId, expressId)` pair can compute directly, while `key` is built inside
 * the adapter out of the stored GlobalId plus an occurrence suffix and cannot
 * be reconstructed from the store alone. Two GPU-instanced occurrences of one
 * entity share a `ref` and both land in the set, which is the intended reading
 * of "this entity is in set A".
 *
 * An EMPTY member list is not an absent one — see `ClashRule.membersA`.
