/**
 * How a clash's `distance` was obtained — the two are NOT interchangeable and

 *
 * - `'mesh'` — measured on the triangle meshes. For `clearance` it is the
 *   exact triangle-to-triangle gap. For `touch` it is usually that same exact
 *   gap, with one exception: a pair whose every candidate depth falls below
 *   the pair's f32 precision floor also reports `touch`, with `distance: 0`
 *   and `distanceKind: 'mesh'` — there the 0 is a CLASSIFICATION (the
 *   surfaces are flush to within what the f32 source coordinates can
 *   represent; nothing is measurably penetrating), not a measured gap.
 *   For a hard clash it is the exact
 *   box-box penetration depth (minimum translation distance along a
 *   separating axis, Gottschalk), certified only when BOTH elements are —
 *   within tolerance — rectangular boxes (`obb.ts`); this replaced an
 *   earlier "deepest crossing-triangle vertex" probe that was a sampling
 *   artifact, converging to 0 as a mesh was retessellated instead of to the
 *   true depth (PR #2536).
 * - `'estimate'` — an uncertified depth: the smallest overlapping dimension of
 *   the two element AABBs, or for a box through-penetration that value capped
 *   by the box-box minimum translation distance (see below). Reported for a hard clash whenever the narrow phase could not
 *   certify a box-box depth. That happens in four shapes, all common in real
 *   models: either element is not (confirmed) a box; surfaces that only
 *   coincide (stacked layers sharing a footprint); one solid modelled wholly
 *   inside another; and a member piercing clean through the other — even
 *   when BOTH are boxes, because the box-box minimum-translation-distance is
 *   then dominated by the piercing member's own extent along the shared
 *   axis, not by the material it actually crossed, and is withheld from
 *   `'mesh'` for exactly that reason. The value is then a property of the two
 *   BOXES, not of the solids — it can equal an element's own thickness rather
 *   than how far the two actually interpenetrate. Treat it as an indication of
 *   scale, not as a measurement. For a through-penetration between two boxes
 *   it never exceeds the box-box minimum translation distance, a distance
 *   proven to separate them (#5742).
