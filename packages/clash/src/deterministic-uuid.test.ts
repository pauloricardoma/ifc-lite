/**
 * `uuidFromSeed` backs BCF topic guids (see deterministic-uuid.ts docstring):
 * a topic's guid must be byte-identical across re-runs so a previously
 * exported BCF topic keeps correlating with the clash it describes. There is
 * no external reference for these bits — this is our own FNV-1a + xorshift
 * mix, and no other tool reproduces it — so "correct" here means "matches
 * what we shipped", not "matches a spec".
 *
 * That makes hard-coded expected values the only test that can catch a
 * silent behavior change: comparing two calls against each other within the
 * same process (as the tests in bcf-bridge.test.ts do) only proves the
 * function is internally self-consistent, which survives *any* change to the
 * salts, the mixing order, or the version/variant nibble derivation as long
 * as the new code is still self-consistent with itself. Confirmed by
 * mutation: replacing all four salt constants in deterministic-uuid.ts with
 * different arbitrary values still produces valid-shaped, internally
 * self-consistent UUIDs, and the existing suite (368/369) does not notice.
 *
 * DO NOT "fix" a failing assertion below by regenerating the expected value
 * from the new implementation. These strings are frozen-output vectors —
 * literally today's implementation's output, captured once, not values
 * derived from any specification or external tool. Regenerating them to make
 * a red test green defeats the entire point of this file: it would silently
 * re-anchor to whatever the algorithm now produces, exactly the drift this
 * test exists to catch. If a change to deterministic-uuid.ts is intentional
 * and meant to change guids going forward, that is a breaking change for
 * every previously exported BCF file and must be called out as such (e.g. in
 * a changeset), not quietly absorbed by updating this file.
