# @ifc-lite/plugin-api

Dependency-free type surface for ifc-lite file-source plugins (CDE integrations).

Plugins implement `FileSourceProvider` and declare a `PluginManifest`. The host
(the ifc-lite viewer) loads providers, auto-generates settings UI from the
manifest's `preferences` array, and injects a sandboxed `PluginContext` at
runtime.

See the [architecture docs](https://ifclite.dev/docs/) for the full design.

## Registering your own provider in a viewer build

The viewer registers its built-in providers itself. A host application that
builds the viewer from source can add its own
`FileSourceProvider` implementations at build time, without patching viewer
source: point the build's entry at a file of your own that calls the viewer's
`mountViewer` (in `apps/viewer/src/bootstrap.tsx`, which is all the stock
`main.tsx` does) with `sourceProviders`.

<!-- docs-check: skip -->
```ts
// Your entry, used in place of apps/viewer/src/main.tsx.
import { mountViewer } from './bootstrap';
import { AcmeProvider } from '@acme/ifc-lite-source';

mountViewer(document.getElementById('root')!, {
  sourceProviders: [() => new AcmeProvider()],
});
```

Each entry is a factory. The viewer constructs and registers each one on its
own, after the built-ins, through the same `SourceHost.register()` path the
built-ins use:

- A manifest whose `api` does not satisfy `PLUGIN_API_VERSION`, a name that is
  already registered (a built-in's included), or an undeclared relay route is
  refused.
- A factory that throws is caught.
- A refused or failed provider is listed in the Sources panel as "failed to
  register" with the reason. It never stops the built-ins or any other
  provider from loading.
- A registered provider gets the same sandboxed `PluginContext` as a built-in:
  https-only fetch to its declared `permissions.network` domains, no ambient
  credentials, no redirects, bounded retries, and storage namespaced by
  `manifest.name`.

This is build-time composition only. The viewer loads no provider code at
runtime, and `.iflx` extensions get no new capabilities from it.

## Reporting download progress

The host draws a per-file progress ring from `DownloadOptions.onProgress`.
`readWithProgress` does the streaming for you: it reads a successful
`Response` body, reports `(received, total)` about ten times a second, starts
at `(0, total)` and ends at `(byteLength, byteLength)`. The total is the
response's `Content-Length`, else the fallback you pass (the file's listed
size), else `undefined`, which the host shows as a spinner.

```ts
import { readWithProgress } from '@ifc-lite/plugin-api';
import type { DownloadOptions, PluginContext } from '@ifc-lite/plugin-api';

async function downloadBytes(
  ctx: PluginContext,
  url: string,
  sizeBytes: number | undefined,
  options?: DownloadOptions,
): Promise<ArrayBuffer> {
  const response = await ctx.fetch(url, { signal: options?.signal });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`download failed: ${response.status}`);
  return readWithProgress(response, options?.onProgress, sizeBytes);
}
```

The `@ifc-lite/source-fixture` conformance suite checks that progress only
increases and that its last call reports every byte returned.

Providers may report `SourceFile.kind`, an `artifactName` distinct from the resource name, and an `unavailableReason` for resources that cannot be imported. Unavailable rows stay visible with an explanation and cannot be selected. `ProviderCapabilities.sourceNamePatterns` customizes the catalog filter; an empty list shows every resource, including generated models without an IFC filename.

`DownloadOptions.onPhase('preparing')` reports preparation before bytes exist; use `onProgress` only for actual download bytes. Interactive providers may implement `SourceAuth.cancelSignIn` to invalidate a pending login. Hosts must guard late authentication and download results so cancelled operations cannot publish a new identity or enter the loader.
