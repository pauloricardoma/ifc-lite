/**
 * `mutate.ts`'s STEP-text rewrite path: finding an entity record's exact
 * bytes in the exported output and splicing a new attribute value into it.
 *
 * Split out of `mutate.ts` (a sibling, not a growth of that file) to stay
 * under the repo's module-size budget.
 *
 * Record LOCATION on main is a per-line regex plus `indexOf('(')` /
 * `lastIndexOf(')')`. That silently drops a mutation -- reporting success
 * with an unwritten edit -- on a record wrapped across several lines, or on
 * one with a comment between its class keyword and `(`
 * (LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#4163): the regex simply does not match, the line is
 * `continue`d past, and nothing marks the mutation as failed.
 *
 * This module locates the record with `StepTokenizer.scanEntities()`
 * (`@ifc-lite/parser`) -- the same balanced-parenthesis, string- and
 * comment-aware scan the parser itself indexes entities with -- to get each
 * target record's exact byte span, wherever it falls relative to line
 * breaks. A record the scan cannot find is now a NAMED failure instead of a
 * silent no-op.
 *
 * The argument list inside that span is split with `splitTopLevelStepArgs`
 * from `./step-args.js` -- the SAME validating splitter `mutate.ts` uses on
 * main: every part must be exactly one STEP token, checked at every depth,
 * or the split is refused (LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#4125 / #2470 -- an undoubled
 * apostrophe inside a string swallows top-level commas, and a by-index
 * write on a mis-scanned split lands on the wrong attribute while reporting
 * success). An earlier version of this module carried its own
 * non-validating splitter and reintroduced exactly that corruption; it is
 * gone.
 *
 * `scanEntities()`'s own balanced-paren scan can itself be fooled: a stray,
 * unmatched `)` inside a malformed record's argument list brings the depth
 * back to 0 early, so the scan reports a record that ends there -- silently
 * TRUNCATED, well short of the record's real (malformed) extent, with the
 * rest of the same record's bytes left looking like orphaned text after it.
 * The truncated span is internally well-formed (it is exactly as long as it
 * is balanced), so a validating splitter given only that span cannot see
 * the truncation either. The guard is structural, not lexical: a located
 * record's closing `)` must be followed (modulo STEP trivia) by `;`, the
 * record terminator. A genuine record always has one there; a truncated one
 * does not, because the bytes that would carry it are still unconsumed
 * argument text.
