 * `ifc-lite diff --by-entity` and the comparison scope it now shares with

 *
 * The flag used to ask every row of the entity index for a GlobalId, which is
 * two different wrong questions at once: a resource entity answered with its
 * *Name*, and relationships and property sets answered with a GlobalId whose
 * identity is not their own. Both are pinned below.
