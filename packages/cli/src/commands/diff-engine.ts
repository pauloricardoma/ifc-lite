/**
 * The CLI's adapter onto the real `@ifc-lite/diff` engine (issue #1891).
 *
 * `ifc-lite diff` on its own answers "what changed at the type and identity
 * level" — counts per type, GlobalIds added and removed. That is useless the
 * moment the two files came from a from-scratch re-export, because every
 * GlobalId is new and the whole model reads as deleted-and-added. `--by-content`
 * routes the same two files through the engine's content-keyed matching pass
 * instead, and lets the accepted matches be written to (and replayed from) an
 * identity-map sidecar.
 *
 * **Data scope only, on purpose.** The Node CLI has no geometry pipeline: no
 * meshes, so no world geometry hash and no bounding box. Rather than pretend
 * otherwise, it passes `scope: 'data'`, which is the honest description of what
 * it can see — the engine then classifies every unambiguous 1:1 content match as
 * `renamed` and reports every genuinely ambiguous group as a group, exactly as
 * it does for a viewer session whose geometry hashing was unavailable.
 *
 * **Scope of the comparison: every `IfcObjectDefinition` in the file**, decided
 * from the schema registry's inheritance chain rather than from what the
 * columnar parser put in its `EntityTable`. That walk is `diff-scope.ts`, which
 * documents the rule and the two silent defects it fixes; `--by-entity` runs on
 * the same walk, so both modes of the command answer about the same entities.
