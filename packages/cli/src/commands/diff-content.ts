/**
 * `ifc-lite diff --by-content` — the engine-backed half of the diff command
 * (issue #1891), plus the identity-map sidecar it can emit and consume.
 *
 * The loop this closes: run it once, review the `renamed` matches, keep the
 * sidecar. On the next run the accepted claims come back in as key aliases, the
 * re-GUIDed elements are matched by key, and they never show up as churn again.
 * Data scope by default — see `diff-engine.ts`; `--geometry` below opts into
 * the wasm mesh pass.
 *
 * Issue #4955 adds three things on the same loop: `--key-from` keys the
 * comparison on an authored identifier instead of GlobalId; `--lineage-out` /
 * `--lineage-in` write and replay the 1:k lineage an external table rekeys on;
 * and `--accept` folds a reviewed identity map (a human's answer to the
 * suggestions a geometry-capable run produced) into that lineage as
 * `replaced` entries.
 *
 * Issue #4956 adds `--geometry`: a lazily-loaded `@ifc-lite/wasm` mesh pass
 * (`diff-geometry.ts`) that attaches world geometry hashes, bounding boxes and
 * volumes to both files' fingerprints, promoting the scope from `data` to
 * `both`. `--split-merge` / `--successors` turn on the two geometry-only
 * detection stages; both are no-ops without `--geometry` (the engine abstains
 * exactly as it does for a viewer session whose geometry hashing failed).
