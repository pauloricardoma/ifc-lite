/**
 * #4047 added a `fatal()` when an entity-isolating filter (`--type`/`--where`/
 * `--storey`/`--limit`) matches ZERO entities, for every isolating export
 * format — fixing a prior bug where a zero-match `--type` on `--format ifc`
 * silently exported the WHOLE model instead of failing (the isolation set
 * was empty, and an empty isolation set means "export everything" to both
 * `bim.export.ifc()` and the Rust wasm exporters). No test in the repo
 * exercised that guard: it was verified once by hand during review (mutating
 * `if (filterRequested && refs.length === 0)` to `if (false && ...)`, seeing
 * the corresponding test go from a rejection to a resolved promise) and never
 * captured, so a future refactor could remove the guard and nothing would
 * notice.
 *
 * Covers the `ifc` format (export.ts) AND the Rust-backed formats
 * (export-rust-formats.ts, split out of export.ts by this same PR) with the
 * same parametrised case, since both paths carry an equivalent guard and
 * emit the same message — see `export-rust-formats.ts`'s `exportRustFormat`.
 * `ifcx`/`usd` are intentionally excluded: those are whole-model formats that
 * never isolate, so a filter is ignored for them (covered instead by
 * `export.whole-model-filters.test.ts`). `hbjson`/`dfjson` are also
 * whole-model formats, covered there too.
 *
 * The companion controls (a real filter still narrows; no filter still
 * exports the whole model) prevent the guard from being satisfiable by
 * simply failing every export. The "no filter → whole model" case for
 * `--format ifc` is already covered by `export.ifc-no-filter.test.ts` and is
 * not duplicated here.
 *
 * These call `exportCommand` directly (as the sibling filter tests do) so
 * the assertions can see stderr and `process.exit` without a build step.

/**
 * #4738: the LAST home of the null-vs-empty collapse, on the TypeScript side.
 *
 * #4664 taught the wasm bindings to tell "no isolation filter" from "a filter
 * that matched nothing" for JSON-LD and STEP. The SDK's own STEP binding,
 * `bim.export.ifc(refs, options)`, still collapsed them: a non-empty `refs`
 * isolates, and an EMPTY `refs` was this backend's "whole model" signal (see
 * `export.ifc-no-filter.test.ts` and `headless-backend.ts`). Both meanings
 * rode on the same argument, so a caller whose filter matched nothing got the
 * entire model back and no error — the very shape #4483/#4484/#4659 closed for
 * the mesh and wasm exporters.
 *
 * Every in-repo caller had to hand-roll its own zero-match guard before the
 * call to stay safe, and the viewer's MCP playground `export_ifc` (which has
 * no such guard) staged a whole-model `.ifc` download for `global_ids` that
 * matched nothing. The fix moves the distinction into the argument itself, at
 * the one shared home above all three backends (`ExportNamespace.ifc`):
 * omitted / `undefined` means no filter, and a given array is an ACTIVE filter
 * that is refused rather than widened when it is empty.
 *
 * This asserts on the exported STEP bytes, not on a flag: on `origin/main` the
 * zero-match call returned a byte-identical whole-model export.
