/**
 * Reading a STEP record's top-level argument list out of its text, for a
 * caller that then edits one slot BY INDEX.
 *
 * The failure this exists to prevent is silent. A scanner that loses track of
 * quote state or paren depth still produces parts; they are just not the
 * record's arguments any more, because the commas it swallowed took every
 * following slot with them. The write lands on whatever the mis-scan
 * accumulated and the caller reports a success that did not happen
 * (LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#2470, #4125 for the `mutate` instance). So this returns
 * null rather than parts it does not believe in.
 *
 * The mis-scan nothing structural notices is an undoubled apostrophe, what an
 * authoring tool emits when it forgets to double one. The scan closes the
 * string at it and reopens on the next quote, so the text between the two is
 * read inside-out and every comma in it is swallowed. TWO of them leave quote
 * parity EVEN and paren depth at ZERO, so the scan ends clean on text that
 * split wrong: `'guid',$,'John's wall',$,$,$,$,'A's',.NOTDEFINED.` is nine
 * attributes read as four, and writing slot 2 deletes attributes 3 to 7.
 *
 * What always shows is a token ending where a token cannot end: the phantom
 * terminator leaves the rest of the content where a separator belongs
 * (`'John's wall'` closes after `John`, leaving a bare `s`). So this validates
 * the list as a grammar rather than counting characters. An argument is ONE
 * token, after a token only whitespace and then `,` or `)` may follow, and that
 * (In the STEP examples below, `*\/` is a JavaScript escape so the example does not
 * terminate this comment block. The backslash is not in the STEP text, and STEP
 * gives `\` its own meaning, so strip it before copying an example into a test.)
 *
 * holds AT EVERY DEPTH. Applied to the top level alone it misses a phantom that
 * swallows a `)`, a `(` and the comma between them, which leaves the depth
 * balanced and each surviving part passing a token check on its own:
 * `IFCLABEL('a's'),$,IFCLABEL('b's'),$` is four attributes read as two. Any
 * two top-level slots that each hold a string inside parens can do it, and real
 * entities have that shape (`IfcPerson`'s MiddleNames / PrefixTitles,
 * `IfcPropertyTableValue`'s DefiningValues / DefinedValues).
 *
 * What the rule cannot see is a corruption whose bytes are themselves a valid
 * argument list: a stray apostrophe at the END of a string's content emits a
 * doubled quote by accident, so `''','''` is two arguments to its author and
 * one to anyone reading the text. A generated sweep accepted 814 of 80,035 corruptions
 * with a split other than the author's, down from 1,066 before the rule reached into
 * lists, and every survivor it looked at had that shape; separating them needs the
 * schema, not the text. That harness is NOT committed, so those figures record one run
 * and cannot be reproduced from this tree.
 *
 * A STEP block comment is refused rather than understood, because `mutate` must
 * not rewrite a record it cannot read: `/` breaks a bare run, so a part
 * carrying a comment outside a string is never one token, whatever the comment
 * CONTAINS. Whitespace in the comment is not what gives it away:
 * `$,/*renamed*\/,$` has none and was read as three slots for two attributes,
 * the same phantom-slot shift as the rest of #4125 (see {@link isTokenBreak}
 * for why breaking on the OPENER is enough).
 *
 * Several readers in this repo DO skip comments; diverging from them is
 * deliberate. The nearest is `validate.ts` in this very package, which skips
 * `/* ... *\/` while counting top-level attribute indices; it returns indices
 * rather than parts, so it never has to put the bytes back. `source-header.ts`'s
 * `splitTopLevel` is closer still, since it returns PARTS, but it drops the
 * comment bytes, so it cannot satisfy the round-trip contract below either.
 * And `packages/parser`'s
 * `entity-extractor.ts` reads comments at every depth through
 * `StepTextScan.skipLexicalAt`, and says so as policy: one comment-skip rule for
 * decoded STEP text rather than a fourth hand-rolled copy. The difference is what
 * the two produce. That one extracts VALUES and collapses a comment to a space;
 * this one must satisfy `parts.join(',') === input` byte for byte, because its
 * caller rewrites the user's file. Skipping a comment under that contract would
 * silently delete it from their file, and keeping it inside the part means the
 * part is not one token. Doing both needs a richer return type than `string[]`,
 * which is a different module. (`STEP_TRIVIA` itself is legal anywhere whitespace
 * is. Its call sites are what place it, and they all put it immediately before a
 * `\(`.)
 *
 * What this module does NOT cover, so its refusal is not read as more than it is:
 * `mutate` finds records with a line regex that allows only whitespace before the
 * `(`, so a comment after the class keyword is skipped BEFORE reaching this code,
 * and the run reports success having changed nothing; and `lastIndexOf(')')` can
 * slice into a legal trailing comment. Both are #4163, one on each SIDE of the
 * argument list (before the `(`, after the `)`), and both are the same
 * line-versus-record shape as the wrapped-record case #4163 also covers.
 *
 * `packages/export/src/step-argument-parser.ts` is the nearest copy, and this is
 * deliberately its near-twin rather than an import: `@ifc-lite/export`'s
 * `exports` map exposes only `.`, so reaching it would mean adding a published
 * export (and an `api-surface` entry) to a v4.0.0 package to fix a CLI bug.
 * #4125 declined consolidating them, with its own measurement of why: the
 * splitters in this repo have different CONTRACTS, so a shared function needs a
 * mode flag or a richer return type, which is a new abstraction rather than a
 * de-duplication. What they could share is the REFUSE side, and for TWO of the
 * three it is pinned rather than described: the export twin and the Rust
 * `split_top_level_args` are both held to the vectors in
 * `rust/export/tests/fixtures/step_refuse_vectors.json`, by
 * `packages/export/src/step-refuse.parity.test.ts` and by
 * `rust/export/src/step_slot_tests.rs`'s
 * `refuses_every_shared_cross_language_vector`.
 *
 * THIS splitter is NOT held to those vectors, and would not pass them today. `"`
 * is absent from `isTokenBreak` below, so a binary literal is consumed as a bare
 * run and two of the shared vectors are ACCEPTED here: `'g',"0F` splits as two
 * parts with the unterminated literal intact, and `'g',"01,23"` splits into
 * THREE parts for two attributes, because the comma inside the literal is read
 * as a separator. The consumer is a live by-index writer — `mutate-step-record.ts`
 * does `args[attrIdx] = …` and then `args.join(',')` — so that is the #4125
 * failure still open in this file, not a hypothetical one. Adding the character
 * is a behaviour change that would also refuse legitimate binary literals such
 * as `"0F"`, which needs corpus verification rather than a one-character edit;
 * LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#4200 tracks both the fix and the parity test that would
 * have caught it.
 *
 * They diverge on the ACCEPT side, deliberately: this one refuses any slot
 * carrying a `/* ... *\/` comment, while the export twin keeps the comment's
 * bytes inside the slot and accepts it. That divergence is each caller's
 * choice, so no fixture pins it.
 *
 * The export twin's `splitTopLevelStepArguments` used to have the three
 * structural checks and no per-part check at all; #4173 gave it one
 * (`isWellFormedStepSlot`), so the two now agree that a part must be one
 * well-formed value.

/**
 * Split a STEP argument list on top-level commas, or return null when the text
 * cannot be scanned as one. `input` is the text BETWEEN a record's outermost
 * parentheses; the module header says why null rather than parts.
 *
 * Nothing is trimmed and nothing is normalised, so for input this accepts
 * `parts.join(',')` reproduces `input` byte for byte and a caller that replaces
 * one part leaves every other byte of the record alone. Rejected: a quote still
 * open at the end, a paren depth that does not return to zero, a depth that
 * ever goes NEGATIVE (a stray closing paren balanced by a later opening one),
 * and a part that is not one token at every depth (see {@link isLoneStepToken}).
 *
 * An EMPTY top-level slot (`a,,b`, or a trailing comma) is NOT rejected: it is
 * invalid STEP that costs no alignment, since an empty argument is one part
 * exactly as the entity parser counts it, so every index still names the
 * attribute it is meant to. An empty INPUT is not an empty slot: `#1=IFCFOO();`
 * has no arguments, so it splits to `[]` and any slot request then fails the
 * caller's bounds check.
