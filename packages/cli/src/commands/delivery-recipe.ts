/**
 * The saved recipe `ifc-lite delivery` runs.
 *
 * A recipe is a plain JSON file naming one or more model files and the
 * checks to run against every one of them — `structural` (the same rules
 * `ifc-lite validate` runs), zero or more `ids` rule files (the same
 * validator `ifc-lite ids` runs), and zero or more `rules` (`.rules.json`)
 * information-validation rule sets (the same engine `ifc-lite check` runs,
 * #5138 PR 7b). It exists so a delivery check is a single, versioned,
 * reviewable artifact a team commits and re-runs, rather than a remembered
 * shell invocation.
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "models": ["model.ifc"],
 *   "structural": true,
 *   "ids": ["door-rules.ids"],
 *   "rules": ["fire-rating.rules.json"]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Every `models`/`ids`/`rules` path is resolved relative to the DIRECTORY
 * CONTAINING THE RECIPE FILE, not the process's current working directory —
 * a recipe committed alongside its fixtures stays runnable from anywhere.
 *
 * A malformed recipe is a `fatal(...)`, matching every other saved-definition
 * loader in this CLI (`schedule-spec.ts`): not valid JSON, not a JSON object,
 * an unrecognised field, a field of the wrong type, an empty/missing
 * `models` list, or declaring NONE of `structural: true`, a non-empty `ids`
 * list, or a non-empty `rules` list (a recipe with zero applicable checks
 * can never produce a meaningful delivery verdict, so it is rejected up
 * front rather than silently reporting an empty "pass").
