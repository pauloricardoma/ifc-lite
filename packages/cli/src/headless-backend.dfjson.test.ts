/**
 * DFJSON counterpart to `headless-backend.hbjson.test.ts`.
 *
 * DFJSON shipped reading `store.source` directly, so it carried the whole of
 * issue #1908 unfixed: anything authored through the in-store edit APIs (the
 * CLI equivalent of the viewer's Space Sketch tool) was invisible to the
 * Dragonfly exporter by construction, exactly as HBJSON was before #1956.
 * Both formats now share the gate in `energy-export.ts`, and this file pins
 * the DFJSON half of that contract independently — a shared helper means a
 * regression in the gate would otherwise only be caught by the HBJSON suite.
