/**
 * Pure scale/extent arithmetic for exporting a section drawing to a
 * dimensionally accurate ("to scale") PDF page (issue #2042).
 *
 * The drawing model (`Drawing2D.bounds`) carries its own real-world extent
 * in metres (see `types.ts`). To print "1:100" correctly, 1 metre in the
 * world must become exactly 10mm on paper — no rounding, no silent re-fit.
 *
 * This module deliberately sizes the PAGE to the drawing extent at the
 * chosen scale (plus a margin), rather than fitting the drawing into a
 * fixed named paper size (A3, A4, ...). That avoids the failure mode in
 * `sheet/sheet-types.ts`'s `calculateDrawingTransform`, which silently
 * shrinks the drawing (`fitScale = min(scaleX, scaleY, 1)`) when it does
 * not fit the configured viewport at the nominal scale — correct for an
 * on-screen preview, but wrong for a PDF whose entire purpose is to be
 * measured at the scale the user explicitly picked.
