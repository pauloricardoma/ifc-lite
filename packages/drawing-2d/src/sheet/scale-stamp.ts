/**
 * The scale record a to-scale sheet carries on the paper itself: a drawn scale
 * bar plus the "1:N" text, laid out in millimetres in a band below the drawing
 * (issue #2042).
 *
 * WHY A SHEET WITHOUT THIS IS DANGEROUS. A to-scale PDF whose only record of
 * its scale is its filename says nothing once it is printed. The whole promise
 * of the export is "measurements taken off the print are correct", and a sheet
 * that carries no scale invites someone to measure it at an assumed one. The
 * printed ratio fixes that for the original; the BAR fixes it for every copy
 * after, because a photocopier that shrinks a sheet to 94% shrinks the bar with
 * it while the text "1:100" keeps claiming a scale the paper no longer has.
 * Those are two different failures, so the sheet carries both.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MUST NEVER DO — the reason it exists as layout maths and not
 * as a sheet template. `sheet-types.ts`'s `calculateDrawingTransform` fits a
 * drawing into a fixed viewport (`fitScale = min(scaleX, scaleY, 1)`), which
 * silently shrinks it. Adding furniture through anything that re-fits would
 * turn an exact sheet into a plausible-looking wrong one, which is the single
 * defect this whole feature exists to prevent. So the band is added by GROWING
 * the page down (and right, only if the stamp is wider than the drawing) and
 * the drawing's `PdfScaleTransform` is passed through untouched — same
 * `worldToMm`, same offsets, same object. Adding a scale bar cannot move a
 * single millimetre of the drawing, by construction rather than by care.
 *
 * The emission is deliberately not here: these are plain rectangles and text
 * runs in page millimetres, so the viewer can write them with jsPDF while the
 * sibling renderers in this folder keep emitting SVG strings.
