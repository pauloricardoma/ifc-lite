## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2657](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2657) [`d1fb40d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d1fb40d1f72bb0b8345644e83e410cc8c240cf38) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the camera-view drawing primitives behind the to-scale 3D-view PDF export (issue [#2042](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2042)): `buildCameraSectionPlane`, `worldBoundsOfMeshes`, `clipMeshToHalfSpace`, `projectWorldLineSeeds`, and a `GeneratorOptions.extraLines` seam.
  
  Exporting "what the user currently sees in the 3D viewport" at an exact 1:N needs three things this package did not have. All three are pure and camera-agnostic; the viewer supplies the camera and assembles the PDF with the existing `pdf-scale.ts` arithmetic, which is unchanged.
  
  `buildCameraSectionPlane({position, target, up}, worldBounds)` turns a camera into a `SectionPlaneConfig` whose `customPlane` carries a strictly **orthonormal** basis — `normal = −viewDir`, `tangent` = screen right, `bitangent` = the re-orthogonalised up — plus the `viewDepth` of the kept window. The orthonormalisation is the load-bearing part: `projectTo2DBasis` is a bare pair of dot products, so it is an isometry only when the basis is unit-length and mutually orthogonal. An orbiting camera's raw `up` is generally *not* perpendicular to its view direction, and using it verbatim skews the page — a print that is dimensionally plausible and wrong, which an engineer only discovers with a ruler. The plane is placed strictly in front of all eight world-bounds corners along the view direction, so every point of the model has a view depth inside `[0, viewDepth]` (the window the depth raster and the projection bands both key off) rather than half the model falling behind the plane. Degenerate inputs are handled explicitly: an `up` parallel to the view direction (the straight-down plan camera) falls back to a non-parallel reference axis instead of producing a NaN basis and a blank page, and a camera whose eye and target coincide throws. `worldBoundsOfMeshes` folds `MeshData.origin` (`world = origin + positions`) rather than reading `positions` raw, which would report a box around the model origin instead of around the model.
  
  `clipMeshToHalfSpace(mesh, normal, offset)` applies the section cut to the triangles themselves — the on-screen section is a fragment-shader clip, and an exported drawing has no fragment stage, so without this the PDF shows the whole model while the screen shows half of it. It is a per-triangle Sutherland–Hodgman clip run in the mesh's **local** frame (`localOffset = offset − dot(origin, normal)`), so emitted positions stay local and `origin` is carried through untouched: a mesh with an `origin` and a baked-positions twin of the same element clip to the same world result, with neither the "test local positions against a world offset" nor the "bake world coordinates in and leave `origin` set" double-fold. It returns the clipped mesh (the input by reference when nothing was cut, `null` when nothing survived) plus the **rim segments** the cut created, in world space. Fields that describe the *whole, uncut* element (`localBounds`, `geometryAabb`, `geometryVolume`, `geometryHash`) and per-vertex data the re-tessellated buffer no longer matches (`uvs`, textures) are dropped explicitly rather than passed on stale. `clipMeshesToHalfSpace` is the batch form.
  
  `projectWorldLineSeeds(seeds, plane)` turns those world-space rim segments into `DrawingLine`s using the existing single-source `projectPointForPlane` / `signedDepth` helpers — never a hand-rolled projection — so the rim shares a frame and a depth sign with the hidden-line depth raster it will be sampled against. They are tagged `category: 'cut'` (heavy line weight).
  
  `GeneratorOptions.extraLines` merges such pre-projected lines into `Drawing2DGenerator.generate` **before** the hidden-line pass. The generator's hidden-line stage previously split lines by category, passing every `'cut'` line straight through — correct for the section cutter's own output, which lies in the plane at view depth 0 and can never be occluded, but wrong for a rim line on an oblique 3D view, which can sit behind other geometry and must print dashed. The split is now by source (caller-supplied + projection lines are classified; the cutter's own cut lines still pass through), so a rim behind an occluder comes out `visibility: 'hidden'`. Behaviour is unchanged for every existing caller: with no `extraLines`, the classified set is exactly the projection lines it was before.
  
  Scale exactness is pinned numerically, not structurally: with an oblique camera (azimuth 30°, elevation 20°, including a non-unit, non-perpendicular `up`), two world points 1 m apart along an in-plane direction derived *independently of the basis under test* project to exactly 10 mm apart at 1:100 and 20 mm at 1:50; a point right of / above the camera target lands right of / above the page centre (the mirrored-output class); and a unit cube cut at x = 0.25 yields a rim that is one closed loop of total length exactly 4.0 m.

- [#2657](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2657) [`d1fb40d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d1fb40d1f72bb0b8345644e83e410cc8c240cf38) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add `addScaleStamp`, the printed scale record a to-scale PDF sheet needs: a drawn scale bar plus the "1:N" text, laid out in a band below the drawing.
  
  A sheet exported at an exact scale whose only record of that scale is its filename carries none at all once it is printed. The promise of a to-scale export is that measurements taken off the print are correct, and paper that does not say what it was drawn at invites being measured at an assumed scale, or being measured after a photocopier has quietly rescaled it. The printed ratio answers the first; the bar answers both, because a copy that shrinks the page shrinks the bar with it while the text keeps claiming a scale the paper no longer has.
  
  - `addScaleStamp(layout, { marginMm })` takes an existing `computePdfScaleLayout` result and returns the grown `page`, the `stamp` geometry in absolute page millimetres, and the layout's own `transform` **unchanged**. The band is added by growing the page down (and right, only when the stamp is wider than the drawing), never by re-fitting: `sheet-types.ts`'s `calculateDrawingTransform` shrinks a drawing to fit a viewport (`min(scaleX, scaleY, 1)`), and routing furniture through anything like it turns an exact sheet into a plausible-looking wrong one. Adding a scale bar cannot move a millimetre of the drawing, by construction rather than by care.
  - The bar is drawn to scale, which is the only thing that makes it worth printing: a division labelled `1 m` measures exactly `1000 / scaleFactor` mm. Division lengths come from the 1-2-5 sequence so the labels stay round, sized to land near 60 mm of paper, never under a 20 mm readability floor (a drawing narrower than that grows the page rather than printing a to-scale sliver nobody can read).
  - The ratio goes through the existing `formatScaleFactorLabel`, and the scale itself is derived from `transform.worldToMm` rather than passed in a second time, so a sheet cannot be drawn at one scale and labelled with another: a 1:99.5 sheet prints "1:99.5", never "1:100" ([#2119](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2119)).
  - `formatSheetScaleLabel(factor)` is the ratio as a sheet may print it: `"1:100"` when the two-decimal label IS the factor, `"about 1:87.35"` when `formatScaleFactorLabel` had to round it. "As displayed" hands over whatever factor the viewport sits at, and printing a bare "1:87.35" would state a scale the drawing was not drawn at, which is an unlabelled sheet's defect wearing a different hat. The number stays at two decimals so the sheet and the export filename can never quote different ratios.
  - The output is plain rectangles and text runs in page millimetres (`ScaleStamp`, `ScaleStampRect`, `ScaleStampText`, `ScaleStampBar`, `StampedSheetLayout`) rather than the SVG strings the sibling `sheet/` renderers emit, because the consumer is a PDF writer. `buildScaleStamp` stays package-private.

- [#2657](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2657) [`d1fb40d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d1fb40d1f72bb0b8345644e83e410cc8c240cf38) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add a flat-shaded colour rasteriser so a to-scale PDF view can show solid coloured surfaces, not just line work.
  
  The to-scale 3D-view PDF export (`computePdfScaleLayout` / `worldPointToPdfMm`) produced monochrome vector line work only, which does not resemble the 3D viewport it is exported from. Filling it with vector paths is not viable: one filled path per triangle is 40-80 bytes of page stream for the 10^5-10^6 triangles a real model has after clipping, and painter's-algorithm ordering is undefined wherever faces interpenetrate, which IFC geometry does constantly (`MeshData.indices` documents that winding is unreliable and meshes are double-sided by design). Resolving those cycles means splitting triangles, i.e. a second CSG kernel.
  
  `buildColorRaster` instead produces an RGBA8 image of the same view, which the caller places at an exact millimetre rectangle underneath the unchanged vector strokes. Dimensional accuracy is unaffected: the rectangle is derived from the raster's own world bounds through the same `PdfScaleTransform` every stroke uses, so pixels bound sharpness and never measured distance, and everything an engineer measures against is still a stroke.
  
  - `buildColorRaster(meshes, plane, occluderDepth, options)` returns `pixels` (RGBA8 straight alpha, row 0 = the top of the drawing), `width`, `height` and `bounds` — the projected extent with NO margin, spanned edge to edge by the pixel grid, so the placement rectangle covers it exactly and registration error is at most half a pixel. Projection and depth come from `projectPointForPlane` / `signedDepth`, the same single-source helpers the line producers use, so the image and the strokes share a frame by construction. Returns `null` when nothing projects into the kept half or the extent is degenerate, so a shaded export can degrade to line work rather than fail.
  - Shading is flat per-face Lambert, `0.4 + 0.6 * abs(dot(faceNormal, viewDir))`, with the normal recomputed from each triangle's own positions. Both details are forced by the data: `MeshData.normals` may be absent or stale, and a signed dot product would paint half the surfaces of an ordinary IFC model black. Colour comes from `MeshData.color` (the apparent rendering colour, what viewers display), not `shadingColor`.
  - Translucent meshes (`color[3] < 0.999`) are composited in a second pass that tests against the opaque depth buffer without writing it, so glass in front of a wall blends over it and glass behind it is dropped. Translucent over translucent composites in mesh iteration order rather than back to front; that approximation is documented at the module and is closer to the viewport than either treating glass as opaque or dropping it.
  - `fitRasterPixels(widthMm, heightMm, dpi, maxPixels, maxDimensionPx)` sizes the grid, with `DEFAULT_SHADING_DPI` (150), `MAX_SHADING_PIXELS` (2^24) and `MAX_SHADING_DIMENSION_PX` (16384). Over-cap requests scale both sides by the same factor and report the `effectiveDpi` actually achieved, so a large sheet gets blurrier and never mis-scaled.
  
  The vertex fetch, projected-extent walk and barycentric test are now shared with the existing hidden-line depth raster through an internal `raster-core` module rather than duplicated. The hidden-line raster keeps its own per-pixel loop and its `width - 1` (centre-to-centre) mapping, which is correct for sampling a depth buffer and wrong for an image rectangle; its existing tests pass unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#2695](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2695) [`b8fb71e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b8fb71e5c19ddf405563664f29e8a6ec22f36b63) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Orient mesh normals by signed volume before silhouette extraction, so an inward-wound solid no longer loses its projected line work ([#2682](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2682)). The silhouette test is winding-sensitive: on an inward-wound mesh it picked the far side of the solid, which the projection band then dropped, producing a blank drawing with no error. A mesh and its reversed twin now yield identical line work.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#2644](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2644) [`7cb7394`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7cb73940e0c23cd6b93c4483bfddb7b45cbb363a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Hidden-line removal now actually occludes (issue [#2639](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2639)). The occluder depth buffer previously rasterized the cut-away half-space, and projection lines carried depth 0 or a negative flip-adjusted depth, so classification degenerated to "everything visible" - or, when no occluder vertex fell in the window and no bounds were passed, to "everything hidden" via NaN buffer indexing. The classifier now rasterizes the kept half of the section, and both the buffer and line depths carry the VIEW DEPTH convention: the negated flip-adjusted signed depth, 0 at the cut plane, increasing into the kept half, smaller means nearer the viewer.

  Breaking changes:

  - `HiddenLineClassifier.buildDepthBuffer(meshes, axis, position, maxDepth, flipped, bounds?)` is now `buildDepthBuffer(meshes, plane, occluderDepth, bounds?)`, taking the full `SectionPlaneConfig`. It honours `plane.customPlane`, so custom (face-picked) planes classify in their own basis instead of silently falling back to the stale cardinal fields.
  - `GeneratorOptions.outlineProvider` is bypassed when `plane.customPlane` is set: the provider contract is cardinal-only (it receives just axis/flipped and returns contours and axis extents in cardinal projection space), so its output cannot be classified against the custom-basis depth raster. On custom planes the generator now uses the plane-aware silhouette path for those meshes instead; on cardinal planes the provider is used exactly as before.
  - `DrawingLine.depth` semantics change to view depth at the line's start point. A new optional `DrawingLine.depthEnd` carries the view depth at the end point; the classifier interpolates between the two along the line.
  - Drawings will show more dashed/hidden projection lines than before, because the previous output never hid correctly occluded geometry.
  - Line samples falling outside the depth raster's 2D bounds now classify VISIBLE instead of clamping onto the nearest border pixel. Outside the raster there is no occluder information, so visible is the only safe default; the old clamping could wrongly hide a line far from any occluder when `buildDepthBuffer` was called without a `bounds` argument and the self-computed bounds (in-window vertices only) collapsed to a sliver of a straddling occluder.
  - `mergeDrawingLines` now derives each merged line's `depth`/`depthEnd` from the source segment endpoints that became the merged endpoints (swapping them when a source segment runs against the merge direction), instead of copying the first source line's pair onto the whole merged run - a copy that was only lossless while every projection line carried depth 0.
  - `applyVisibility` re-derives `depth`/`depthEnd` for every partial-visibility split segment by lerping the parent line's pair at the split points, so each emitted segment's endpoint depths describe its OWN endpoints. Previously a split carried the parent's original pair unchanged, and merging such a split with a neighbour could report a depth describing a point the segment no longer touches.
  - `VisibilitySegment` gains required `tStart`/`tEnd` fields: the affine parameters (0..1) of the segment's endpoints along the parent line, the same parameterisation the classifier sampled visibility with.
  - The classifier samples a line's final point exactly (a t = 1 lerp can overshoot the endpoint by one ulp on sign-straddling coordinates and fall outside the raster) and opens a visibility transition at the final sample, so `overallVisibility` and the emitted segments always agree; a genuine visibility flip within the last inter-sample gap now yields a final half-sample split segment instead of being silently dropped.

### Patch Changes

- [#2622](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2622) [`a351839`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a35183910da35bd44dd38c5ed50d49d5f73b9f4a) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Scale two fixed-epsilon section-cut tolerances to the element's own coordinate magnitude, so large single elements (long alignments, bridge decks, big roofs) stop producing wrong cut geometry.

  **Plane-side classification (`section-cutter.ts`).** `EPSILON = 1e-7` (in `math.ts`) classified a triangle vertex's signed distance to the cut plane as "on the plane" only within `±1e-7`. For an arbitrary (non-axis-aligned) cut plane, that distance is a dot product summing three float32-quantized coordinates, so even a vertex whose true distance is exactly 0 carries rounding noise proportional to its own coordinate magnitude — around `1e-6` already at ordinary building scale (a 1m element), an order of magnitude above `1e-7`. When that pushed a genuinely coplanar face's vertices out of the epsilon band, the "on-plane, skip" branch was bypassed and the general edge/plane lerp ran on two noise-sized values instead: `t = d0/(d0-d1)` divided one near-zero noise term by another, producing a wildly extrapolated point — metres away, not a tiny nudge — instead of correctly emitting nothing for a face lying on the cut plane. Reproduced with a flat quad placed exactly on a tilted custom plane: segments with endpoints thousands of units from the actual geometry, already at a 1m element, worse at scale. Fixed by computing a per-triangle epsilon, `max(EPSILON, maxVertexCoordinate · 2⁻²²)`, and threading it through the plane classification and edge/plane intersection instead of the fixed constant.

  **Vertex-weld tolerance (`polygon-builder.ts`).** The default 0.0001 (0.1mm) tolerance for welding ring-closing vertices doesn't scale with the cut segments' coordinate magnitude. Two independently-tessellated triangles or material-layer sub-meshes that happen to author the "same" physical boundary point twice — a common source of near-duplicate vertices in mesh output — differ by up to one float32 ULP, which exceeds 0.1mm once a single element's own extent passes roughly 840m (RTC per-element origins mean this is the element's own size, not distance from the model origin). Below that, the weld tolerance already covers the noise. Reproduced: a square entity with its one corner authored twice, offset by a single float32 ULP, welds correctly at 400m but leaves a spurious 5th vertex (an extra near-duplicate corner) at 500km with the fixed tolerance; scaling the tolerance with the entity's own segment-coordinate magnitude (`max(0.0001, extent · 2⁻²²)`, applied per entity so one large element can't loosen welding for smaller ones sharing the same drawing) restores the correct 4-vertex square.

  Near-origin output is unaffected in both cases — the new terms only exceed the existing constants once an element's own coordinate magnitude passes roughly 400–800m, so ordinary elements are bit-identical to before.

  **Measured on the element's own local frame, not its position in the model.** Both terms above are sized from a per-mesh vertex coordinate magnitude, and that magnitude must come from the `Float32Array` values as authored (the mesh's own local frame), _before_ the per-mesh RTC `origin` translation is applied — that translation happens in double precision and never reintroduces quantization noise, so it must not feed the tolerance. The first version of this fix got that backwards: `section-cutter.ts` computed its epsilon from the world-lifted vertex (`local + origin`), and `polygon-builder.ts`'s `withScaleAwareTolerance` sized itself off `p0_2d`/`p1_2d`, which are also world-frame (the cutter never subtracts the origin back out before projecting to 2D). Either one scales the tolerance to an element's _distance from the model origin_ instead of its own extent — the opposite failure from the one this changeset otherwise fixes, and far coarser: a small (2m) element sitting at an RTC origin of ~500,000 got a plane-classification epsilon around 0.119 instead of ~5e-4, misclassifying genuine close plane crossings as coplanar, and a weld tolerance wide enough to fuse genuinely distinct nearby vertices. Fixed by deriving both from the local (pre-origin) coordinate magnitude: `section-cutter.ts` computes it directly from `positions` before `origin` is added, and attaches it to each emitted `CutSegment` as `localMaxCoord` so `polygon-builder.ts` can use it too (falling back to the segment's own 2D magnitude only for segments not produced by `SectionCutter`, e.g. hand-built fixtures with no origin to begin with).

  Found while investigating two tolerance-sizing candidates flagged by an f32-precision audit but left undemonstrated in [#2621](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2621) (which fixed an unrelated missing-origin-lift bug in `edge-extractor.ts`); both are demonstrated here with reproductions that disappear only when the corresponding tolerance is widened, and persist with a naive fixed-epsilon workaround once the element is large enough — confirming the tolerance itself, not something else, was responsible.

  No breaking API surface change (constructors and public method signatures are unchanged; `CutSegment` gained one optional `localMaxCoord` field, and private helper signatures gained parameters).

## 1.21.2

### Patch Changes

- [#2621](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2621) [`118188b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/118188b22c0685f07c3537f0500b0bcb2aa4b33f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `EdgeExtractor` reading mesh positions as if they were already world space. Positions are stored in the element's local frame (`world = origin + local`) on the wasm client path; `section-cutter.ts`, `storey-bands.ts`, and `gpu-section-cutter.ts` already lift by `mesh.origin`, but `edge-extractor.ts` did not, so crease/boundary/silhouette edges from an origin-shifted mesh were extracted in the wrong place and compared against the world-space section plane and bands incorrectly — landing in the wrong depth band or projecting far from the correctly-placed cut polygons. `getVertex` now lifts by `mesh.origin` when present, matching `section-cutter.ts`. Meshes with no origin (or `[0,0,0]`) are unaffected.

  Also fix `HiddenLineClassifier` (`hidden-line.ts`), which the `EdgeExtractor` change above left inconsistent: it still rasterized its occlusion depth buffer from raw local-frame positions while `drawing-generator.ts` now feeds it world-space lines from the fixed `EdgeExtractor`. With projection and "show hidden lines" both enabled and a non-zero `mesh.origin`, this silently turned hidden-line removal into a no-op. `hidden-line.ts`'s `getVertex` now lifts by `mesh.origin` too, at both the bounds-computation and rasterization call sites.

## 1.21.1

### Patch Changes

- [#2381](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2381) [`3029cb2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3029cb2813940438dd43de3cca9e6b25546dad80) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix an infinite loop in `PolygonBuilder.classifyLoops` that hung the viewer at ~95% load (issue [#2364](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2364)). The nearest-ancestor search introduced by [#2331](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2331) tested containment with a single point, so two partially-overlapping loops could each "contain" the other's start vertex, making the parent pointers cyclic and the nesting-depth walk spin forever. Parents are now restricted to earlier (larger-or-equal-area) loops in the area-descending sort, which keeps the ancestor relation acyclic by construction.

- [#2331](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2331) [`70c431d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/70c431d3d9a12a5217ac0c1912da18bce7548e4e) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `PolygonBuilder.classifyLoops` misclassifying an island (e.g. a mullion cross-section, or a column stub) nested inside a hole as a second hole of the outer boundary, instead of a solid polygon in its own right. Previously every ring's containment was tested only against the top-level outer boundary, so anything geometrically inside it — at any nesting depth — became a hole, silently turning the island into void in the rendered section drawing. Loops are now classified by nesting depth relative to their nearest containing ancestor: even depth is a solid outer boundary, odd depth is a hole of its immediate parent.

## 1.21.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2119](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2119) [`f566a3a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f566a3af5d92728d682a150282e37de3ece3a613) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix a showstopper found in review of the scaled PDF export ([#2042](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2042), reported on PR [#2119](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2119)): `front` and `side` section PDF exports rendered off-page for any model at ordinary (asymmetric-about-zero) world coordinates. The page layout was derived from the drawing's un-flipped bounds while points were drawn flipped, which only produced a correctly-positioned page when the bounds happened to be symmetric about zero — the uncommon case. `computePdfScaleLayout`'s offsets must now be derived from the bounds as they are actually drawn; the new `flipBounds2D` helper (and `@ifc-lite/viewer`'s `computePdfSectionLayout`/`makeSectionMapPoint`) keep the two in sync. Also: the PDF export filename no longer rounds the scale factor with `Math.round` (v1 has no title block, so the filename is the sole record of a sheet's scale — a 1:99.5 export used to be filed as `…-1-100`); it now reuses the same rounding rule as the SVG title block's scale label (`formatScaleFactorLabel`, extracted from PR [#2131](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2131)). `computePdfScaleLayout` now also validates its derived OUTPUTS (page size, offsets), not just its inputs, since finite inputs can still multiply/divide out to a non-finite page size that would otherwise reach jsPDF. The async PDF-construction/download path now shows an alert on failure (e.g. a failed `jspdf` chunk load) instead of surfacing only as an unhandled promise rejection. The PDF export's cut-line skip is now scoped to entities actually covered by a cut-polygon outline — cut-category `drawing.lines` are still drawn when the polygon reconstruction failed to close a loop for that entity, instead of being silently dropped.

- [#2119](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2119) [`f566a3a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f566a3af5d92728d682a150282e37de3ece3a613) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Add `computePdfScaleLayout`, `worldPointToPdfMm`, and `worldLengthToPdfMm`: pure scale/extent arithmetic for exporting a section drawing to a dimensionally accurate ("to scale") PDF page ([#2042](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2042)). The page is sized to the drawing extent at the exact chosen scale plus a margin, rather than fit into a fixed named paper size, so a selected scale (e.g. 1:100) is never silently re-scaled to make the drawing fit — unlike the existing sheet-fit transform in `sheet/sheet-types.ts`, which is correct for an on-screen preview but not for a document someone measures from.

### Patch Changes

- [#2131](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2131) [`ae2debf`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ae2debf665fdbe25afd9e16411bd2347dcd4f39d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Make `SVGExportOptions.padding` (documented as "Padding around drawing in mm") actually affect `SVGExporter.export()` / `.exportPolygons()` output. Since the exporter's original commit, `computeTransform` derived `availableWidth`/`availableHeight` from `padding` and never used them anywhere — the option was a silent no-op regardless of value.

  **Behaviour change:** `padding` is now a minimum-margin guarantee. `computeTransform` keeps the caller's exact requested `scale` when the drawing already leaves at least `padding` mm of margin on the chosen paper (the common case, and unchanged from before). When it would leave less than that — or the drawing overflows the paper outright — the effective scale is shrunk (never enlarged) just enough to respect the margin; centring is otherwise unaffected, since padding is applied uniformly on all sides.

  `padding` defaults to `20` (mm) in both `export()` and `exportPolygons()`, so **this can change output for callers who never pass `padding` explicitly** — not just callers who pass a non-zero value — whenever their drawing, at its requested scale, is closer than 20mm to the paper edge. `padding: 0` is unaffected except in the pre-existing edge case where a drawing already overflows the paper at the requested scale with no padding at all (previously silently overflowed the page; now clamped to fit).

  **Review follow-ups (both are cases where "padding is a minimum-margin guarantee" was not actually a contract):**

  - **The title block's "Scale:" label could lie.** `computeTransform` clamps the effective scale to honour the margin, but `createTitleBlock` printed the caller's _requested_ `scale.name` unconditionally — a sheet clamped from 1:100 to, say, ~1:973 still read "Scale: 1:100". That is a confidently wrong document: scaling a dimension off the printout is the entire reason a scale label exists, and it would be silently wrong by the clamp ratio. The label is now derived from the _effective_ scale whenever the drawing was clamped (rounded to 2 decimal places, trailing zeros stripped, e.g. `1:127.3`), and continues to print the exact requested name unchanged — no floating-point re-derivation — on the common, unclamped path.
  - **An impossible `padding` (`padding * 2 >= paperSize.width` or `.height`) used to disable the clamp entirely** on the affected axis, silently falling back to rendering at the full requested scale with no margin honoured at all — the same "no padding at all" failure this changeset otherwise removes, just reached from the opposite direction. `padding` is now clamped to the largest value the paper's shorter dimension can still hold (leaving a minimum 1mm sliver of drawable area) and a `console.warn` is emitted; the export keeps working rather than throwing, since this is a published package and a large-`padding` caller should not have their existing integration start throwing on upgrade.

The underlying ASCII DXF R12 writer stays package-internal; only the exporter facade (and its `DXFExportOptions` / `DXFUnderlayOptions` types) is public API.

  `exportToDXF` mirrors `exportToSVG`'s `Drawing2D` + reference-underlay input contract (same polylines/edges, hatch-boundary polygons, text/annotations, and per-style layers) and writes ASCII DXF R12 (`$ACADVER` = `AC1009`): HEADER, TABLES (LTYPE, STYLE, LAYER), ENTITIES (classic POLYLINE/VERTEX/SEQEND, LINE, TEXT). Layer names follow the strict R12 symbol rules (31 characters, `A-Z a-z 0-9 $ - _`), with numeric-suffix disambiguation when distinct source names collide after sanitizing. R12 is deliberate — entity handles and subclass markers are mandatory from R13 on and this writer emits neither, so declaring a later version would produce an invalid hybrid file that strict readers (AutoCAD, ODA/Teigha-based tools) reject or force-repair. R12 has no `$INSUNITS`; the unit (always metres) and, when known, the target CRS are stated in a leading `999` comment instead. Hatched cut polygons are represented as closed POLYLINE boundaries on a dedicated layer rather than a HATCH entity. An optional `coordinateTransform` lets a caller re-derive world/map coordinates before points reach the writer (used by the viewer's "Download DXF" section-panel export, issue [#1861](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1861), to georeference plan sections).

  It already existed in `math.ts` and is used internally by `section-cutter.ts`
  for face-picked custom-plane sections, but was never re-exported. The new
  point-cloud "scan" layer on the 2D section view (issue [#1805](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1805)) needs it as a
  consumer outside the package, to project retained scan points into the same
  drawing-space coordinates the section cutter produces for custom (non-cardinal)
  cut planes.

The geometry slicer no longer caps the layer interface planes — capping doubled each shared interface into a coincident, non-watertight "ghost face" sheet and ~tripled the triangle count on layered walls. With the interfaces left open, the 2D section's polygon builder is now bidirectional (each open band closes at the interface chord) and, for 3+ layer walls, stitches the disconnected end strips of an interior layer (which has no wall face) back into a closed fill at the interface chords — so every layer keeps its section fill.

  Harden that reconstruction on OPENING-cut walls so the 3D section cap covers every layer (no more wall-reads-hollow in section view). An opening splits each layer into disconnected solid chunks; the old greedy nearest-endpoint stitch hopped an interior layer's strip to the strip ACROSS the opening, emitting one self-overlapping polygon that bridged the void and failed to fill. Closure now runs along the interface lines (the principal/length axis of the band, so it is robust to rotated walls): endpoints are paired CONSECUTIVELY along each interface line, which closes each solid chunk and leaves the opening between chunks empty. Ambiguous layouts fall back to the previous stitch, so no case is made worse.

  Add an opaque base-cap backstop so a 3D section cut can NEVER read see-through, even on a wall the per-layer reconstruction cannot resolve. For each multi-material entity the builder also emits its full closed cross-section (the watertight union of the bands always closes, so this needs no interface stitching), carried in a new `Drawing2D.layerBaseCutPolygons` that ONLY the 3D section overlay consumes (the flat 2D drawing, SVG export, and measure/snap paths are untouched). The overlay draws this opaque base first and the per-layer colours over it, so the colours show where they reconstruct and solid cut material shows everywhere else.

  Fix multilayer walls reading HOLLOW in normal (uncut) 3D, not just in section. The renderer backface-culled material-layer slices on the assumption their winding was reliably outward — correct for the OLD closed per-layer slabs (the cull hid their coincident interface caps). Since the slabs became open bands whose union is the wall's watertight outer skin (no caps), and IFC winding is not reliably outward, culling dropped inward-wound faces and punched holes, so the wall looked like a thin see-through shell. Layer slices now render DOUBLE-SIDED like all other IFC geometry: every face of the watertight skin draws, so the wall reads solid. With no coincident caps left there is nothing to z-fight, so the cull that motivated the special pipeline is removed (the `GEOM_CLASS_LAYER_SLICE` tag stays — it now only marks per-layer section fills).

## 1.18.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1160](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1160) [`631511e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/631511eedb135ea8bfc7caf640edea8862b86a59) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Restore per-layer slicing of single-solid walls/slabs with an `IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage`. Slicing turns one solid into one coloured sub-mesh per material layer (geometry_id = the layer's `IfcMaterial`) so the build-up is visible in 3D. The "Merge Multilayer Walls" toggle now does what its label promises for these walls too — "render walls as one solid": with the toggle on, the layer index is not attached, so each wall stays a single swept solid instead of slicing into layers (off, the default, shows the layered build-up).

  The slicing kernel stayed intact, but [#874](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/874) (mesh-production unification) dropped the `set_material_layer_index` wiring from every pipeline, so the router's index was always `None` and `try_layered_sub_meshes` never fired — layered walls silently rendered as a plain single solid in the browser, native, and server paths. Re-wire it: build the `MaterialLayerIndex` once per load (cached on the IfcAPI for the streaming path, with a cheap substring bail-out so files with no layer set pay nothing) and attach it to every batch router. This also restores the "Merge Multilayer Walls" toggle for models whose sliceable walls carry their geometry as `IfcBuildingElementPart`s — the merged parent now actually draws its sliced solid instead of leaving a gap.

  2D section now shows the layers too. The section cutter carries each sub-mesh's colour onto its cut segments (CPU and GPU paths), and the polygon builder splits one entity's cut into a polygon per material colour — single-material elements still produce one colourless polygon, so their existing per-`ifcType` / per-entity fill is unchanged. When the viewer shows IFC materials, each sliced layer fills with its own `IfcMaterial` colour instead of one colour for the whole wall, and the layer divisions are drawn as outlines — matching the 3D build-up.

  Two follow-on robustness fixes:

  - **3D layer glitch (z-fighting).** Adjacent layer slabs share the parent wall's `expressId`, so the renderer's per-entity depth nudge (keyed on `entityId`) gave their coincident interior interface caps the SAME depth — under `cullMode: 'none'` + MSAA that z-fought into a flickering comb that read as "see inside / not solid". The shader now folds the per-draw `baseColor` into the depth-nudge hash; batches are keyed by colour, so abutting layers (distinct colours) land on distinct depths. Constant per draw, so flat faces stay flat and curved surfaces are unaffected.

  - **Cap watertightness on irregular profiles.** A layer slab's innermost cut is built by two successive plane clips; on a non-convex `IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef` the two passes deposit geometrically-coincident section vertices that differ by ~1 ULP. `cap_half_space_clip` welded by exact f32 bits, so those twins stayed separate, the boundary chain dead-ended and a cap sub-loop was silently dropped — leaving open edges (a hole you could see through and a section with no fill there). The cap now welds on a spatial grid tied to its on-plane tolerance, collapsing the twins so the loop closes. Single-plane callers (opening cuts) have no such twins and are unaffected.

  - **3D section cut read hollow.** The live 3D section cap (`Section2DOverlayRenderer`) filled each cut polygon with a naive convex fan over the outer ring only, ignoring holes — a long-standing KNOWN LIMITATION. On the concave cross-sections that arbitrary IFC profiles (and material-layer slabs) cut into, the fan inverts and leaves the cut face uncovered, so a sectioned wall read as a hollow shell. The fill now uses the renderer's existing hole-aware ear-clipping (the same one the annotation-fill path uses), so the cut face is solid. The cap also now honours a per-polygon colour: a material-layer wall fills each layer of its 3D section cut with that layer's `IfcMaterial` colour (matching the 3D solids and the 2D section), while single-material cuts keep the uniform cap style + hatch unchanged via a sentinel.

  - **Solid layered 3D walls via backface culling.** Rendering a material-layer wall as N thin coincident-faced layer solids made it shimmer / read as a hollow shell — adjacent layers' interface caps z-fight under the viewer's double-sided rendering (culling is globally off because general IFC winding is unreliable), and same-material adjacent layers can't be depth-separated. The layer slices DO have reliable outward winding, though, so they're now tagged `geometryClass` 3 and the renderer draws that class with a dedicated **backface-culling** pipeline: the build-up stays visible on the wall's faces and edges, but the interior coincident caps never rasterise, so the wall reads as a clean solid (and a section cut through it shows the interior material surface rather than a hollow shell). The 2D/section cut consumes the same class — it never culls — for its per-layer fills. Cache `FORMAT_VERSION` → 9 so stale caches re-mesh with the class-3 slices.

- [#1114](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1114) [`16d87f2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/16d87f201dfd7d4cba46bb43e0f4a44ccce717bb) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Per-element local frame: eliminate f32 "fan" corruption on building-scale and georeferenced models.

  When a mesh is stored at f32 precision while its vertices sit at building-scale world coordinates (a model whose extent reaches ~200 m from the coordinate origin), the f32 mantissa only resolves ~15 µm there, so vertices closer than one ULP collapse to the same value and the triangles joining them fan out as long needles across the model. Lowering the global RTC threshold is the wrong lever (it is reserved for >10 km federation re-basing), and a single global recentre still leaves the model genuinely spanning ~200 m.

  Each element's vertices are now stored RELATIVE to a per-element `MeshData.origin` (the f64 AABB centre, snapped to the kernel reconcile grid `1/65536 m`), so the f32 coordinates stay element-small and collapse-free at any building or georef scale; the world position is `origin + position`. The renderer reconstructs world space with a per-batch model-matrix translate around a single shared scene origin (so abutting elements in different colour batches stay bit-coincident with no seam z-fighting), and the selection-highlight / GPU-picker buffers replicate the batch's exact f32 path so highlights are bit-coincident with no depth bias. The local frame is ON for the wasm (viewer) path and opt-in for native/server, so determinism snapshots and server output stay absolute-coordinate byte-identical.

  Every world-space consumer of element geometry now folds `origin` (`world = origin + position`): camera/scene bounds, the CPU raycast + BVH narrow phase, snap detection, the section cutters (CPU + GPU), the BIM↔scan deviation BVH, the spatial index, clash (world-frame triangles fed to both the TS and Rust kernels), the glTF / IFC5 / Parquet exporters, the Cesium GLB overlay, the construction-projection outline + storey-band derivation, and the federation alignment / mesh-duplicate paths. `MeshData.origin` is serialized in the geometry cache (format version 6, which auto-heals stale entries). Position differences (normals, edge vectors, areas) are origin-invariant and unchanged.

  This composes with the sub-grid sliver hygiene pass: the local frame removes the f32-storage fans, and `Mesh::clean_degenerate` removes the sub-grid slivers the finer-grained CSG host emits.

  - **Current-floor scoping.** On a plan cut of a multi-storey model the projection
    bands now clamp to the storey the cut sits in, instead of projecting the whole
    model height — so a roof two levels up no longer draws on the ground-floor plan.
    New `@ifc-lite/drawing-2d` exports back this: `currentFloorBands` (pure band
    math) and `storeyFloorsFromMeshes` (per-storey floor levels from mesh-Y in the
    render frame, plus the `StoreyFloorMesh` type). The caller derives band depths
    from these; storey-less / single-storey / federated models fall back to the
    full-extent bands unchanged.
  - **Opening exclusion.** `IfcOpeningElement` and the rest of the
    `IfcFeatureElement` family no longer participate in projection.
    `Drawing2DGenerator.generate` filters them from BOTH the profile and the
    mesh-silhouette paths via the new `isFeatureElementType` helper, and the Rust
    `extract_profiles` (`@ifc-lite/wasm`) skips `is_subtype_of(IfcFeatureElement)`
    at the source so opening void cross-sections never become projection profiles.

  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

### Minor Changes

- [#650](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/650) [`2ff772d`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2ff772d0174f8cd6657f7e4090e15bc7744e8158) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Arbitrary-normal section planes with face-pick (Bonsai-style) and a
  properly-rendered cap on tilted planes (#243). Click any face in the
  section tool's "Pick" mode to cut through it; the kept half-space
  defaults to the side facing the camera. The cardinal "Down / Front /
  Side" presets are unchanged.

  Renderer:

  - New `planeBasis(normal)` + `nearestCardinalAxis(normal)` exports
    derive a deterministic in-plane basis used by both the cap renderer
    and the 2D cutter — without a single shared derivation the cap hatch
    rotated when state was reconstructed.
  - `SectionPlaneRenderOptions` and `SectionPlane` gain optional
    `normal` + `distance` fields. When set, the shader clips on that
    plane verbatim (no axis mapping, no building-rotation, no
    position-percentage math) and the gizmo renders as a violet quad
    oriented from `planeBasis(normal)`.
  - `Section2DOverlayRenderer.uploadDrawing` accepts an optional
    `customPlane = { origin, tangent, bitangent }`. When supplied it
    replaces the cardinal-axis 2D→3D coordinate swap with
    `origin + tangent·x + bitangent·y`, so the cap silhouette lands
    exactly on the tilted plane (the bug PR #581 hid by suppressing the
    cap entirely for non-cardinal planes).

  Drawing-2d:

  - `SectionPlaneConfig` gains an optional `customPlane`. `SectionCutter`
    uses it verbatim for the plane equation and projects intersections
    to 2D via `(dot(p − origin, tangent), dot(p − origin, bitangent))`,
    matching the cap renderer's lift exactly.
  - `DrawingGenerator` now rebuilds the CPU cutter on each `generate()`
    call so a switch from cardinal to custom (or between custom planes)
    takes effect immediately.

  Tests: 11 new viewer tests covering normalisation, sign-preserving
  cardinal mapping, basis orthonormality, half-space flip, slice
  clearing on cardinal preset, and degenerate-normal handling. 6 new
  renderer tests covering basis derivation across cardinal axes,
  near-axis tilts, and the +Y / −Y reference-axis boundary.

## 1.15.3

### Patch Changes

- [#561](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/561) [`8f4df0e`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/8f4df0e50e22419353829114b5af80cfd5d45805) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - 3D section cap with screen-space hatches, driven by exact cut polygons.

  ### `@ifc-lite/renderer`

  - **3D cut surface (cap) rendering.** `Section2DOverlayRenderer` gained
    a fill pipeline that paints the user's cap style on top of the exact
    polygons `SectionCutter` produces from triangle-plane intersection.
    Eight built-in screen-space hatch patterns are supplied via the new
    `section-cap-style.ts` module: `solid`, `diagonal`, `crossHatch`,
    `horizontal`, `vertical`, `concrete` (clean dot grid, ISO 128-50),
    `brick`, `insulation`. Pattern ids match the numeric branches in the
    fill fragment shader and are pinned by unit tests so changes can't
    drift silently. New `Section2DOverlayCapStyle` shape carries fill,
    stroke, pattern id, spacing/angle/width, and a secondary cross-hatch
    angle.
  - **Outline + fill toggle independently.** `Section2DOverlayOptions`
    has new `showFills` and `showOutlines` booleans, both honoured by
    `Section2DOverlayRenderer.draw()`, so callers can hide the cut hatch
    without losing the line drawing or vice versa.
  - **Cap respects model depth.** Both fill and outline pipelines test
    with `depthCompare: 'greater-equal'` (reverse-Z) and don't write
    depth, so when the camera looks through closer model geometry the
    cap is occluded naturally. Cap polygons live exactly on the plane,
    so equal-depth ties tie cleanly with greater-equal.
  - **Cap fill landed exactly on the plane.** Removed the old 0.3 m
    vertical bias that made the hatch visibly drift off the slider
    position; the fill now sits on the cut surface itself.
  - **Depth format unified at `depth24plus-stencil8`.** Main, instanced,
    section-plane preview, and 2D overlay pipelines all declare the same
    depth/stencil format and route through `PIPELINE_CONSTANTS.DEPTH_FORMAT`
    so the literal lives in exactly one place. All in-pass pipelines also
    declare both colour attachments (main colour + objectId, the latter
    with `writeMask: 0`) so WebGPU validation passes regardless of which
    shaders render inside the section render pass.
  - **`flipped` flag plumbed end-to-end.** Main and instanced fragment
    shaders pack `enabled` (bit 0) + `flipped` (bit 1) into one flag slot
    and negate the keep side when flipped — slider position stays where
    it is, only the kept half swaps.
  - **`SectionCapStyle`, `HatchPatternId`, `DEFAULT_CAP_STYLE`, and
    `HATCH_PATTERN_IDS` exported from the package** as the canonical
    styling primitives consumed by the viewer store and the fill shader.
  - **Renderer log on first section enable** (`[Section] Y-up bounds
used for clip: …`) so a user can verify the slider range matches
    their geometry without opening a debugger.

  ### `@ifc-lite/drawing-2d`

  - **Plane equation no longer changes when `flipped`.** Both
    `SectionCutter` and `gpu-section-cutter` now build the plane normal
    from `getAxisNormal(axis, false)` regardless of the flipped flag.
    Previously the flipped normal was paired with an unchanged
    `planeDistance`, which described a different plane (`y = -position`
    instead of `y = position`) — the cutter then looked for intersections
    far outside the model and produced an empty 2D drawing. `flipped` is
    still honoured by `projectTo2D` so the resulting drawing mirrors
    correctly when viewed from the opposite side.

  ### `viewer`

  - **`SectionCapControls` panel.** New compact controls inside the
    expanded Section panel: independent Display toggles for _Surfaces_
    (cap fill) and _Lines_ (outline), hatch pattern dropdown, fill +
    stroke colour pickers, and Spacing / Angle / Width number inputs in
    a 3-col grid. The hatch fieldset disables itself when Surfaces are
    off so users can't tweak settings that don't apply. Every control
    has an explicit `id`/`htmlFor` association via `useId()` for
    assistive tech.
  - **Flip button reflects state.** Now toggles `variant` to `default`,
    carries `aria-pressed`, and swaps `aria-label`/`title` between
    "Flip cut direction" and "Unflip cut direction".
  - **Auto-enable on slider/axis change.** Moving the position slider or
    picking a direction now sets `enabled: true` so users no longer get
    stuck in a no-op "preview mode" wondering why nothing cuts. The
    bottom toggle relabelled "Clip on/off" instead of the old
    "Cutting/Preview" wording that read as if the cut was always live.
  - **2D panel auto-fits on Flip.** `useViewControls` now triggers
    `fitToView` on `sectionPlane.flipped` change as well as axis change,
    so flipping doesn't park the polygons off-screen and leave the
    panel blank.
  - **Cap style persists across reloads.** `showCap`, `showOutlines`,
    and the full `capStyle` (fill, stroke, pattern, spacing, angle,
    width, secondary angle) round-trip to `localStorage` under the keys
    `ifc-lite:section-cap-show`, `ifc-lite:section-outlines-show`, and
    `ifc-lite:section-cap-style`. `resetSectionPlane()` clears them so
    the default button actually resets. `resetViewerState()` (called on
    every IFC load) preserves persisted cap settings and only clears
    axis/position/enabled/flipped — so opening a new file no longer
    wipes the user's hatch and colour choices.
  - **Cap style types deduplicated.** `SectionCapHatchId` and
    `SectionCapStyle` in the viewer store are now re-exports of the
    renderer's `section-cap-style.ts`, so adding a new pattern only
    requires editing the renderer.
  - **localStorage failures are diagnosable.** Every persistence catch
    in `sectionSlice` now logs via `console.warn` instead of a bare
    `catch {}` — quota / private-mode / serialisation failures still
    fall back gracefully but show up in devtools.

## 1.15.2

### Patch Changes

- [#552](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/552) [`aeb5edf`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/aeb5edf89605d103582f68866c92d69ef6cb4635) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when the published packages are loaded by Node's native ESM resolver (SSR, serverless, Vitest Node mode, CI test runners, etc.).

  Several relative imports in the source omitted the `.js` extension. Under the old workspace `moduleResolution: "bundler"` TypeScript tolerated them and emitted the specifiers verbatim, so `dist/*.js` shipped extensionless relative imports. Bundlers (Vite/webpack/esbuild) resolved them transparently, but Node's native ESM resolver strictly requires the file extension and threw `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` — most visibly in `@ifc-lite/renderer`'s `dist/snap-detector.js` importing `./raycaster`.

  All offending relative imports have been rewritten to include explicit `.js` (or `/index.js` for directory imports), and every publishable package's TypeScript config now uses `module: "nodenext"` + `moduleResolution: "nodenext"` so the TypeScript compiler rejects extensionless relative imports at build time, preventing regressions. Every published package has been smoke-imported via `node --input-type=module` to verify the fix end-to-end.
