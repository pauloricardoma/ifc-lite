/**
 * #1973 — textured meshes must reconstruct `world = origin + position`.
 *
 * `transform_mesh_world_framed` (on by default for wasm) stores each element's
 * vertices RELATIVE to a per-element `MeshData.origin` so the world magnitude
 * stays out of f32. The batch path folds that origin into the shared frame; the
 * textured sub-pass hard-zeroed its model translation, so every textured
 * occurrence drew offset by `-origin` — collapsed toward the world origin,
 * while CPU picking used the correctly placed geometry.
 *
 * The invariant asserted here is the one the issue asks for: a textured face
 * set and its untextured twin land at the same world AABB. Buffer allocation
 * and draws need a real GPUDevice, but the origin bookkeeping and the
 * interleaved vertex data are GPU-agnostic, so a capturing stub suffices.
