/**
 * Turning one colour batch into the set of partial sub-batches that should be
 * drawn for it this frame.
 *
 * A colour batch draws with ONE uniform per draw, so any per-entity property
 * that disagrees within a batch has to be expressed by drawing subsets of it.
 * Two such properties exist, and they compose:
 *
 * - **Colour-override promotion** (#677): an entity carrying a deliberate lens/
 *   Pset override must draw through the OPAQUE pipeline, the only draws the
 *   entity colour table paints (#6076). Promoting the whole
 *   batch would drag non-overridden batchmates opaque, so a mixed batch splits
 *   into `:promoted` and `:remaining`.
 * - **X-Ray alpha** (#4129): `transparencyOverrides` / `ghostExceptIds` name
 *   entities, so a batch whose entities resolve to different alphas splits into
 *   one `:xN` slot per distinct alpha. Otherwise fading one element faded every
 *   batchmate that happened to share its colour.
 *
 * Each emitted entry names a cache SLOT (`sourceBatchKey`). Slots are stable
 * across frames — that is what lets the sub-batch cache hold a clone per slot
 * instead of rebuilding every frame — and distinct, so a batch can own several
 * at once without them overwriting each other.
