/**
 * Section 2D Overlay Renderer
 *
 * Renders 2D section drawings (cut polygons, outlines, hatching) as a 3D overlay
 * on the section plane in the WebGPU viewport. This provides an integrated view
 * where the architectural drawing appears directly on the section cut surface.
 *
 * SIZE (issue #2456): this module is deliberately over the ~400-line house rule.
 * Everything that could leave without dragging a GPU resource across a module
 * boundary has left — the WGSL to `shaders/section-2d-overlay.wgsl.ts`, the
 * 2D→3D lift and cap triangulation to `section-2d-lift.ts`, the per-family
 * vertex buffer to `section-2d-line-buffer.ts`, the cap pipeline descriptors
 * to `section-cap-pipelines.ts`. What is left is one nullable,
 * `init()`-created / `dispose()`-destroyed GPU object (pipelines, one
 * bind-group layout, one bind group, one uniform buffer holding a 160-byte
 * record per draw site) plus the published API over it: one
 * `setLineOverlay`/`hasLineOverlay`/`drawLineOverlay` trio covering every
 * standalone line channel and the section cut's own upload/draw. Splitting further gives
 * shared resources a second owner, which #2456 explicitly refuses.
