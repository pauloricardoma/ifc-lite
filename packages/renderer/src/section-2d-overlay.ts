/**
 * Section 2D Overlay Renderer
 *
 * Renders 2D section drawings (cut polygons, outlines, hatching) as a 3D overlay
 * on the section plane in the WebGPU viewport. This provides an integrated view
 * where the architectural drawing appears directly on the section cut surface.
 *
 * SIZE (issue #2456): this module is deliberately over the ~400-line house rule.
 * Everything that could leave without dragging a GPU resource across a module
 * boundary has left — the WGSL to `shaders/section-2d-overlay.wgsl.ts`, the
 * 2D→3D lift and cap triangulation to `section-2d-lift.ts`, the per-family
 * vertex buffer to `section-2d-line-buffer.ts`. What is left is one nullable,
 * `init()`-created / `dispose()`-destroyed GPU object (two pipelines, one
 * bind-group layout, one bind group, one uniform buffer holding a 160-byte
 * record per draw site) plus
 * the published `upload*`/`clear*`/`has*`/`draw*` API over it. Splitting that
 * further means giving those shared resources a second owner, which is the cut
 * #2456 explicitly refuses. Do not "fix" the line count by doing it.
