/**
 * Where a hole's bridge edge attaches to the boundary it is being spliced into
 * (see `joinHoles` in `fill-triangulate.ts`).
 *
 * "Nearest vertex to the right" alone is not enough. The bridge has to be a
 * segment that stays inside the material — if it crosses a boundary edge, an
 * already-spliced hole, or an earlier bridge, the merged ring is no longer a
 * simple polygon and ear clipping is entitled to emit nonsense. Ranking by
 * distance lands on a visible vertex in nearly every case, because a wall's own
 * corner is nearer than anything behind it; the exception is a long blocking
 * edge whose endpoints are both far away, which leaves a vertex on its far side
 * as the nearest candidate.
 *
 * So candidates are ranked exactly as before (to the right first, then by
 * distance) and the first one whose bridge crosses nothing wins. The ranking is
 * unchanged for the common convex case, which is why simple profiles produce
 * byte-identical rings to before.
