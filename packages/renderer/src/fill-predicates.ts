 * Scale-aware geometric predicates for the fill triangulator.
 *
 * Every tolerance in here is RELATIVE. An absolute one would be a trap: a
 * cross product carries squared coordinate units, so a threshold tuned for a
 * cut face measured in metres silently reclassifies every crossing in a face
 * measured in millimetres — collinear where it is not, "clear" where the
 * bridge in fact cuts through a wall. The section overlay sees both, because
 * the model's own unit assignment decides what a coordinate means.
 *
 * So orientation is tested as a SINE (determinant over the two operand
 * lengths) and position along a segment as a PARAMETER (dot over the squared
 * length). Both are dimensionless, so the same constant means the same thing
 * at any model scale.
