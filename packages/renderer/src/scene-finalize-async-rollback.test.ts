/**
 * `finalizeStreamingAsync` is the time-sliced twin of `finalizeStreamingInner`
 * (see scene-finalize-rollback.test.ts). Unlike the sync path, its chunked GPU
 * rebuild runs across `setTimeout` continuations with no try/catch, so a
 * mid-rebuild GPU failure (e.g. createBuffer OOM) on a LATER chunk:
 *  - is NOT caught by any try/catch around the Promise executor (a throw
 *    inside a setTimeout callback is a distinct macrotask, not part of the
 *    executor's synchronous frame — see the empirical probe in the PR notes),
 *  - leaves `finalizeInProgress` stuck true forever,
 *  - leaves `streamingFragments` wiped (emptied by the synchronous preamble)
 *    with no restoration,
 *  - destroys any live `partialBatchCache` entry before the rebuild could
 *    fail (dropAllPartialCaches ran unconditionally in the preamble), and
 *  - leaves the returned promise permanently unsettled (neither resolved nor
 *    rejected), so callers with no timeout/race have no way to observe failure.
 *
 * These tests seed two buckets and force a yield after the FIRST batch (via
 * budgetMs=0), so the second — the one that throws — runs inside a real
 * setTimeout continuation, not the promise executor's synchronous frame.
