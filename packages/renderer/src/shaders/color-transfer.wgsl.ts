/**
 * Colour transfer shared by every shader that lights or tone-maps: the
 * geometry fragment stage (`main.wgsl.ts`, and the textured variant derived
 * from it) and the procedural sky (`sky.wgsl.ts`). One home, so the model and
 * the sky cannot drift onto different "film stocks".
 *
 * The contract:
 *
 *  - Authored colours (IfcColourRgb, IFC5 / glTF base colours, overlay tints,
 *    texture texels) are display-referred sRGB. `srgbToLinear` decodes them
 *    before they are multiplied by light, because light adds and multiplies
 *    linearly and sRGB values do not.
 *  - `neutralCompress` rolls off highlights only. Anything whose brightest
 *    channel is below 0.76 (about 227/255 once encoded) passes through
 *    untouched, so a colour up to that brightness, lit at unit neutral
 *    irradiance, renders as authored; brighter colours roll off with their
 *    hue preserved (pure white lands at 0.88, about 241/255, leaving
 *    headroom for sunlit highlights). It is the Khronos PBR Neutral operator
 *    without its toe: the toe subtracts up to 0.04 to cancel the specular F0
 *    offset a dielectric picks up under a unit-radiance environment. This
 *    renderer's sky is far dimmer, so its specular term (specular.wgsl.ts)
 *    lifts a dark matte surface by only about 0.01-0.02, and keeping the toe
 *    would crush dark materials below their authored value.
 *  - `linearToSrgb` is the exact piecewise encode. The canvas is configured
 *    with a non-sRGB format, so the shader must encode.
