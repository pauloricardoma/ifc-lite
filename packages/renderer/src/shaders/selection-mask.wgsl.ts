/**
 * Fragment stage for the selection/hover mask pass (#5390). The vertex
 * stage is `mainShaderSource`'s `vs_main` (recompiled as its own
 * `GPUShaderModule`, reusing the exact same RTE/section-plane/transform
 * math the selection highlight draw already uses) — this module supplies
 * only the fragment side, so the two can be mixed in one pipeline: a
 * fragment entry point with no declared inputs is interface-compatible
 * with any vertex stage, since `@builtin(position)` is always available.
 *
 * Manual depth test instead of a real depth-stencil attachment: comparing
 * `@builtin(position).z` (this fragment's own device depth) against the
 * scene depth texture (`depth-reconstruct.wgsl.ts`'s `loadDepth`, same
 * sample-0 convention as the AO/edge passes) means the mask targets stay
 * single-sample regardless of the scene's MSAA sample count, with no
 * resolve step of their own.
 *
 * Every output first drops fragments the section plane or clip box cuts
 * away (`sectionClipped`, shared with `fs_main`), so an outline never traces
 * geometry the section tool removed. That reads the mesh uniform at group 0
 * and the `worldPos` / `eyePos` varyings `vs_main` already emits.
 *
 * Three outputs, at most one per pipeline:
 *  - `fs_mask_selected_visible` / `fs_mask_hover_visible`: pass only where
 *    this fragment is at least as close as the stored scene depth
 *    (reverse-Z: `>=`), i.e. not occluded. `discard` otherwise, so the
 *    additive blend leaves the target at 0 there. The comparison is NOT
 *    exact: the stored depth is sample 0 of an MSAA attachment (not the
 *    pixel centre) and was usually written by the batch draw, whose
 *    positions may be quantized, so the same surface lands a slope-sized
 *    step away. `isVisible` therefore allows this fragment's own depth
 *    slope (`fwidth`, taken before any branch so it stays in uniform
 *    control flow) plus `MASK_DEPTH_REL_TOLERANCE` of its depth; reverse-Z
 *    depth is proportional to 1/distance, so that is a relative distance
 *    tolerance. A fixed 1e-7 epsilon failed on every pixel of a real
 *    WebGPU frame, leaving the visible mask empty.
 *  - `fs_mask_selected_all`: always passes (drawn "through occluders").
 *
 * Instanced variant (#5745, `instanced = true`): the vertex stage is
 * `vs_instanced` instead, so one draw covers every occurrence of a template.
 * The same entry points then also keep only the occurrences they are for:
 * selected ones (instance flag bit 0) for the selected outputs, and the one
 * whose entity id is the hovered id (a small uniform at
 * `SELECTION_MASK_HOVER_GROUP`) for the hover output. Hidden occurrences
 * (flag bit 1) are dropped, as `fs_main` drops them. The section/clip cut and
 * the depth test are the same code as the non-instanced variant.
