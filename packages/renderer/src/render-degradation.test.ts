/**
 * The "degrading and not recovering" threshold policy (issue #2417).
 *
 * `Renderer.render()` refuses to latch on a throw that is not a device-loss
 * signal, because host memory pressure on a live device must cost one frame and
 * not the session. The cost of that (correct) choice is that a failure which
 * never clears is indistinguishable from one that did. This is the policy that
 * closes that blind spot, tested apart from the renderer so the threshold and
 * its once-per-session latch are pinned on their own.
