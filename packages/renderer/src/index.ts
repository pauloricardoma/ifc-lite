 * Is this throw the GPU device telling us it is gone?

 * The discriminator is the exception TYPE, not its message, because WebGPU
 * draws exactly that line:
 *  - a call on a dead / invalid-state device throws a `DOMException`
 *    (`InvalidStateError` in Safari 26.5 — the whole of issue #2229);
 *  - a buffer allocation the host cannot back throws a plain `RangeError`
 *    ("createBuffer failed, size (…) is too large … when mappedAtCreation ==
 *    true"), which `gpu-upload-guard` documents happening on a HEALTHY device
 *    under memory pressure.
 *
 * Treating the second as a device loss is a false positive that costs the whole
 * session, so only the first latches; everything else degrades one frame.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO consecutive-failure threshold as a middle ground.
 * Not because failures necessarily arrive back-to-back — between two BCF / IDS
 * capture frames the awaited `camera.frameBounds` normally does let an ordinary
 * rAF frame through, which would reset a counter — but because those ordinary
 * frames are not guaranteed to SUCCEED: they allocate too (`ensureMeshResources`
 * creates a buffer per unresourced mesh, and the queued-mesh flush allocates),
 * so under sustained host memory pressure any finite budget is still reachable.
 * A latch whose safety depends on incidental animation timing is the wrong
 * shape of guarantee for "never kill the viewport by mistake".
 *
 * Real losses on browsers that do not throw are still caught by the async
 * `device.lost` promise — which the WebGPU spec makes the sole loss channel
 * anyway (on a conformant engine, calls against a lost device are no-ops, not
 * throws; Safari 26.5's synchronous throw is the deviation being handled here).
 *
 * `typeof` guarded because non-DOM hosts (Node before 17, some workers) have no
 * `DOMException` global; there, no throw can be a WebGPU device signal anyway.

     *  - a `DOMException` is the device reporting its own death synchronously
     *    (Safari 26.5, issue #2229). It latches the same `deviceLost` state the
     *    async `device.lost` promise would: later frames become quiet skips and
     *    `onDeviceLost` listeners fire exactly once.
     *  - anything else (a `RangeError` from a buffer the host cannot allocate,
     *    say) costs only this frame: the swap-chain config is invalidated so
     *    the next frame reconfigures, a frame is re-requested within a bounded
     *    budget, the failure is counted in `getDiagnostics()`, and rendering
     *    carries on. Once enough such frames have degraded without recovering,
     *    `onPersistentRenderDegradation` fires once.
     *
     * SCOPE: `renderFrame()` has two try/catch regions — this outer one (canvas
     * resize, context setup, evicted-batch restore) and an inner one opened
     * after the swap-chain texture is acquired, covering encoder work through
     * `submit`. Until #2417 only the outer one discriminated, so a device that
     * died after `getCurrentTexture()` succeeded degraded quietly forever with
     * no latch and no toast. Both now run the same policy; the encode catch
     * additionally balances the frame's validation error scope before doing so.
