/**
 * Pure statistics for frame/pass GPU timing (issue #2670 perf-verdict gate).
 *
 * Everything in this file is arithmetic over plain numbers/bigints — no
 * `GPUQuerySet`, no `performance.now()`, nothing that touches a clock or a
 * device. That split is deliberate: the thin GPU-facing code in
 * `frame-timing-gpu.ts` cannot be exercised without a WebGPU adapter with the
 * `timestamp-query` feature (which this environment's Chromium does not
 * expose — `navigator.gpu` itself is absent), so every number it produces is
 * pushed through here, where it CAN be tested with synthetic values.
 */

/**
 * Summary statistics over a sample of frame or pass durations, in
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * A mean hides exactly the stutter a perf verdict cares about — one frame
 * that spikes to 40 ms among fifty at 8 ms barely moves a mean, but it is
 * the one a user notices. `p95` (and `max`, its worst case) are the
 * statistics this module treats as the headline; `mean` and `median` are
 * kept for context, not as the number to gate on.
 *
 * `count === 0` is the explicit empty-sample marker: every other field is
 * `null` rather than `0`, because a real all-zero sample and "nothing was
 * measured" must never be indistinguishable to a caller reading this object.

 * `performance.now()`) are in milliseconds, so every raw pair gets converted
 * through this one function.
 *
 * Takes `bigint` (the actual readback type) so a caller cannot accidentally
 * pass an already-lossy `Number(timestamp)` of a value that may exceed
 * `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (a query set can hold timestamps for a
 * long-running session; ~104 days of nanoseconds overflows a JS number).
 * The subtraction happens in `bigint` space and only the final, small
 * (sub-second, in practice sub-100ms) millisecond duration is converted to
 * `number`.
 *
 * Clamps a negative delta (`endNs < startNs`) to `0` rather than returning
 * a physically impossible negative duration. This is reachable: GPU
 * timestamps are not guaranteed monotonic across a device reset (see this
 * module's own doc above). `0` is the honest floor — a duration cannot be
 * negative, and unlike a raw negative number it cannot silently drag a
 * `min`/`mean` computed downstream into nonsense. This is the guard's one
 * choke point: `frameTotalMs`/`passDurationsMs` (`frame-timing.ts`) sum
 * this function's output directly, without ever routing it through
 * `computeDurationStats`, so a guard placed only in `computeDurationStats`
 * would miss that summation entirely. Use `isNegativeDelta` alongside this
 * function where the caller wants to know a clamp happened.

 * single honest millisecond number for every downstream summation (see
 * `frameTotalMs`/`passDurationsMs` in `frame-timing.ts`, which add its
 * output directly into a running total and never pass through
 * `computeDurationStats`) AND separately expose "this one was bad" — a
 * plain `number` return has no second channel for that. Callers that want
 * to surface an invalid-sample count (rather than let a clamped-to-0 value
 * pass as an unremarkable real zero) call this predicate on the same raw
 * pair alongside `nsToMs`. `computeDurationStats` is deliberately NOT where
 * this lives: by the time a caller has an array of plain millisecond
 * numbers, it has no way to tell a clamped GPU-reset zero apart from a
 * genuine fast pass or a CPU-fallback delta (which is never negative — it
