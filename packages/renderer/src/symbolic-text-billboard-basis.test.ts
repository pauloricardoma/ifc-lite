/**
 * The billboard basis the world-space text labels (grid bubble tags) are
 * oriented by must come from `viewBasis` — the same derivation the frame's
 * view matrix is built from (#2489, closing the drift #2467 closed for the
 * unprojection ray).
 *
 * The copy that used to live inline in `SymbolicOverlays.drawTexts` computed
 * `cross(forward, up)` itself and guarded only its two DIVISORS, with
 * `Math.hypot(...) || 1`. That leaves two whole classes of pose broken:
 *
 *   • A non-finite coordinate anywhere in the pose poisoned the NUMERATORS,
 *     so `right`/`up` came out all-NaN and went into the text pipeline's
 *     uniform. `camera.setPosition/setTarget/setUp` take their arguments
 *     verbatim on purpose (the pose is raw public state that BCF viewpoint
 *     restore writes), so this is reachable through the public API.
 *   • `eye === target`, and an `up` parallel to the view direction (a plan
 *     pose, or a restored viewpoint), are perfectly FINITE degeneracies that
 *     the `|| 1` guard let through as a zero-length `right`/`up` — which
 *     collapses every glyph quad to a point. A finiteness assertion alone
 *     would not catch these; the length assertions below do.
 *
 * Every case asserts the VALUES handed to the pipeline. "Did not throw" is
 * exactly the assertion that cannot catch either failure: NaN and zero-length
 * axes both draw quietly.
