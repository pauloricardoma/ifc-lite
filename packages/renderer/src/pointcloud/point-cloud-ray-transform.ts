/**
 * Ray <-> point-cloud local-frame conversion for snap queries.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Two features landed independently and left a gap between them:
 *
 * - #1804 gives each point-cloud node a per-asset model matrix
 *   (`PointCloudNode.model`) applied at RENDER time — the shader places
 *   points through it, and `transformAabb` folds it into reported bounds.
 * - #1860 built the snap/measure spatial index, which stores RAW,
 *   untransformed chunk positions straight off the decoder.
 *
 * So for a georeferenced (aligned) scan the renderer draws points at
 * aligned positions while the snap query walks an index of pre-alignment
 * positions: a measurement snapped to where the point USED to be, not
 * where the user can see it. Both features are individually correct; the
 * defect only exists in their composition, which is why neither PR's tests
 * caught it.
 *
 * ## Why the ray moves, not the points
 *
 * We inverse-transform the ray into the node's local frame rather than
 * transforming candidate points into world space:
 *
 * - The index's cell keys are packed RELATIVE to the first indexed point
 *   and are only meaningful in local space — transforming points would
 *   invalidate the whole acceleration structure.
 * - It is O(1) per node instead of O(points-examined).
 *
 * ## Distances stay in world units
 *
 * `queryRay` treats `t` as a distance along a UNIT direction and compares
 * `toleranceAt(t)` as a perpendicular radius, both in the index's own
 * space. Under a matrix with scale `s`, a world distance `d` is a local
 * distance `d / s`. Every distance-valued quantity therefore has to be
 * converted on the way in and back on the way out:
 *
 *   maxDistance_local = maxDistance_world / s
 *   toleranceAt_local(t_local) = toleranceAt_world(t_local * s) / s
 *   distance_world = distance_local * s
 *
 * Get this wrong and the ~8px screen-space snap tolerance silently means
 * something different on any scan whose CRS is not in metres (a foot-based
 * CRS carries s = 0.3048), which would read as "snapping feels wrong on
 * US survey-foot projects" — the sort of bug that is very hard to trace
 * back to a matrix.
 *
 * The alignment matrices this handles are similarity transforms (uniform
 * scale * rotation about Y, zero translation — see `pointCloudAlignment`),
 * so a single scalar `s` is exact. `matrixUniformScale` falls back to the
 * mean column length for anything else, which keeps a non-uniform matrix
 * approximately right rather than wildly wrong.
 *
 * ## Known limit: long-range reach under a sub-unit scale
 *
 * `PointCloudSpatialIndex` caps its per-step dilation at
 * `MAX_DILATION_RADIUS_CELLS * cellSize` = 2 LOCAL units, a deliberate
 * bound on march cost. Because the tolerance is converted into local
 * units, a matrix with `s < 1` tightens that cap in world terms: a
 * foot-based CRS (`s = 0.3048`) caps the effective snap radius at
 * `2 * 0.3048 = 0.61 m` rather than 2 m, so at long range a point inside
 * the nominal ~8px tolerance can sit outside the searched cells and be
 * missed.
 *
 * This is a reach limit, not a wrong answer: whatever the query returns is
 * correctly placed, and near-to-mid range (where measuring actually
 * happens) is unaffected. Restoring the full world-space reach means
 * scaling the cap to `MAX_DILATION_RADIUS_CELLS / s` (~14 cells at
 * s = 0.3048), which re-inflates the per-step probe cost that the
 * leading-slab bound exists to contain — a perf trade that should be made
 * deliberately, with a benchmark, rather than folded into this fix.
