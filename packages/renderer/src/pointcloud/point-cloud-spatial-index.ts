/**
 * CPU spatial index over one point-cloud asset's positions (issue #1860).
 *
 * The measure tool picks by CPU ray-casting triangle meshes
 * (`scene-raycaster.ts` / `raycast-engine.ts`); point clouds never
 * participate because their positions are packed straight into a GPU
 * vertex buffer and discarded (`point-cloud-node.ts` `appendChunkToNode`
 * never retains the source `Float32Array`). This index is built
 * incrementally as chunks stream in (or on the one-shot IFCx upload
 * path) and keeps just enough CPU-side state to answer "which real scan
 * point is closest to this ray, within a screen-space tolerance".
 *
 * Storage: a coarse uniform voxel grid. Points bucket into
 * `floor(coord / cellSize)` cells, keyed by a single packed integer
 * (`packKey`) so the grid is a plain `Map<number, number[]>` — no
 * string hashing, and no need to know the cloud's final extent up
 * front. Keys are packed relative to the FIRST indexed point's cell so
 * they stay exact f64 integers even for un-rebased georeferenced clouds
 * (LV95 / UTM eastings in the millions of metres); see `CELL_KEY_BIAS`.
 *
 * Memory: each inserted chunk's `Float32Array` is kept BY REFERENCE
 * (never copied) — it would otherwise be garbage immediately after
 * `appendChunkToNode` finishes packing it into the GPU buffer, so
 * retaining it here is the only reason it survives. That is an
 * unavoidable 12 bytes/point (three f32) if snapping is to hit real
 * points rather than an approximation. The grid itself adds roughly
 * 8 bytes/point (one array slot per point, across however many cells)
 * plus a small constant per occupied cell — a few MB per million
 * points at typical scan density. The safety valve on extreme
 * (tens-of-millions-of-points) clouds has two independent limbs:
 * `DEFAULT_MAX_INDEXED_POINTS` bounds retained position memory (it
 * binds on dense scans), and `DEFAULT_MAX_INDEXED_CELLS` bounds the
 * `cells` Map itself below V8's 2^24-entry ceiling (it binds on sparse
 * clouds, where occupied cells track the point count nearly 1:1).
 *
 * Query: `queryRay` walks cells in ray-marching (Amanatides & Woo DDA)
 * order, so cost is O(cells touched along the ray), not O(points) —
 * a query over a 50M-point cloud still only tests a handful of cells.
 */

 * `insertRange` creates at most one new cell per indexed point and, on a
 * SPARSE cloud, very nearly one per point: airborne LiDAR at 1-20
 * points/m^2, or a coarse site scan, puts on the order of one point in

 * `cells === points`, and a 30M-point cap sits ABOVE `V8_MAP_MAX_ENTRIES`
 * — the Map throws at 16,777,216 cells, i.e. the valve could never bind
 * on exactly the clouds it was written for. Dense terrestrial scans put
 * thousands of points in a cell and never come close, which is why the
 * gap survived.
 *
 * The two limbs bound different resources and neither implies the other:
 * a sparse cloud exhausts cells long before points; a dense one exhausts
 * points with a tiny grid. Both are enforced.
 *
 * Chosen 1M cells below the engine limit: high enough that it binds only
 * where V8 would otherwise have thrown (no cloud that indexes fully today
