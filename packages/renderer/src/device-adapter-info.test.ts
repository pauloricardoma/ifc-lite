/**
 * The adapter-identity snapshot for device-loss telemetry (issue #2624).
 *
 * The #2624 field report - "GPU device lost (unknown): A valid external
 * Instance reference no longer exists." - arrived with no way to tell WHAT GPU
 * died. `WebGPUDevice.init()` now snapshots `GPUAdapterInfo.vendor` and
 * `.architecture` so the loss report can carry them. These tests pin the two
 * properties that make the snapshot safe to read at loss time:
 *
 *  - it is a defensive COPY taken at init, never the live GPUAdapterInfo, so
 *    a browser mutating (or invalidating) its info object after a loss cannot
 *    change what we report;
 *  - the read is fully defensive: `adapter.info` shipped only in
 *    Chrome/Edge 128 and Safari 26, so a runtime without it - including one
 *    whose getter THROWS - must still complete `init()`, with the snapshot
 *    null.
 *
 * They drive the real `init()` under node against a hand-stubbed
 * `navigator.gpu`, the same by-hand GPU-stub approach as this package's other
 * lifecycle tests (renderer-init-reentry.test.ts stubs `GPUTextureUsage` the
 * same way).
