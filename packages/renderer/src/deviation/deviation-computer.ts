 * BIM ↔ scan deviation as a composed collaborator (issue #2425).
 *
 * Owns the whole deviation concern's state — the `DeviationPipeline`
 * and the BVH-reuse fingerprint — so the `Renderer` holds one field
 * instead of two and `computeDeviations` becomes a delegation. Nothing
 * outside this file reads either piece of state: the render loop, the
 * diagnostics counters and the bounds tracker are all untouched by it,
 * which is what makes this seam separable at all.
 *
 * The collaborator borrows (never owns) the device, the point-cloud
 * renderer and the scene — they arrive per call in `DeviationComputeContext`.
