/**
 * Thin GPU-facing half of frame/pass timing (issue #2670 perf-verdict gate).
 * Everything with judgement — statistics, unit conversion, mode selection —
 * lives in `frame-timing.ts` / `frame-timing-stats.ts`, which are pure and
 * fully covered by synthetic-value tests. This file is deliberately as small
 * as it can be: it only creates the `GPUQuerySet`, writes `timestampWrites`
 * into pass descriptors, resolves the query set into a readback buffer, and
 * hands the raw nanosecond pairs to the pure aggregator. None of it runs in
 * this environment (`navigator.gpu` is absent here, so there is no test file
 * for this module — a mock `GPUDevice` would only prove the mock is
 * internally consistent, not that the real WebGPU calls are correct) and
 * none of it should be trusted without exercising it on a real
 * `'timestamp-query'`-capable adapter.
 *
 * OPT-IN, NOT WIRED BY DEFAULT: nothing in this codebase constructs a
 * `GpuFrameTimingRecorder` today. A caller enables it explicitly:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const recorder = GpuFrameTimingRecorder.create(device); // null if unsupported
 * if (recorder) {
 *   const pass = encoder.beginRenderPass({
 *     ...descriptor,
 *     timestampWrites: recorder.beginPass('main'),
 *   });
 *   // ...draw calls...
 *   pass.end();
 *   recorder.endFrame(encoder);
 *   device.queue.submit([encoder.finish()]);
 *   const samples = await recorder.readback(); // PassTimingSample[] | null
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Measuring every frame changes what you're measuring (query resolution and
 * the readback `mapAsync` are not free), so a caller should sample
 * intermittently (e.g. every Nth frame) rather than every frame in a
 * shipped build — this module does not impose that policy, it only makes
 * one frame's measurement cheap and correct.
 */

 * `timestampWrites`. Pure: given a labels array and a `BigInt64Array`, the
 * resulting `PassTimingSample[]` is fully determined; no `GPUBuffer`
 * mapping is involved. Extracted out of `readback()` so this pairing
 * arithmetic — the part that would silently mis-attribute a duration to
 * the wrong label on an off-by-one — is checked directly.
 *
 * `GpuFrameTimingRecorder.readback()` always calls this with
 * `timestamps.length === labels.length * 2` (it sizes the readback slice
 * from the same `nextQueryIndex` cursor that `beginPass` pushed each label
 * against — see `readback()`'s call site), so a short buffer cannot occur
 * on that path today. But this function is exported precisely so it can be
 * exercised standalone, and a caller passing a corrupted or hand-built
 * buffer must not get back a sample whose `startNs`/`endNs` is `undefined`
 * where the type says `bigint`: that silently propagates into
 * `frameTotalMs`/`passDurationsMs` (`frame-timing.ts`), which throws a
 * `TypeError` mixing `BigInt` and `undefined` for a one-short buffer, or
 * silently computes `NaN` for a two-short buffer — two different failure
 * shapes for what is really the same input error, and neither is the
 * "never throws, never fabricates" contract the rest of this module's
 * siblings hold themselves to. A label whose (start, end) pair does not
 * fully fit in `timestamps` is dropped rather than pushed with a missing
 * field.
