/**
 * Preset views: the ViewCube's six named directions, plus the admission check
 * that decides whether a preset may be applied at all.
 *
 * Split out of `camera-framing.ts`, which owns the *free* framing pickers
 * (point / bounds / extents — "put the camera on this thing, keeping the
 * current direction"). Presets are the opposite subject: the direction is
 * dictated by the named face and the caller's rotation cycle, and the box is
 * whatever the caller supplied or whatever the current pose implies. The two
 * share only box arithmetic, which is why this module imports `centerOf` /
 * `maxExtentOf` rather than owning a second copy.
 *
 * Pure by construction, exactly as `camera-framing.ts` is: everything here
 * reads `CameraInternalState` and returns a target, nothing writes to it or
 * touches the tween. That is what keeps both modules free of a cycle back into
 * `camera-animation.ts`, which is the one that applies the results.
 *
 * **Guard placement.** `resolvePresetBounds` validates the box exactly once,
 * here, and a rejection is `null`. Callers null-check and do nothing else: a
 * second, defensive copy of the same guard in the caller would mean neither
 * copy is load-bearing on its own, and the mutation test that pins this guard
 * would go quiet while still looking green.
