/**
 * Geometry cache building for snap detection.
 *
 * Three stages, in order, because each one is what makes the next answerable:
 *
 * 1. WELD by position (`snap-weld.ts`). The wasm mesh is unwelded across
 *    creases, so classifying edges by vertex INDEX made every physical edge
 *    arrive twice with one adjacent triangle each — every edge looked like a
 *    boundary edge, the coplanarity test below could never fire, and the cache
 *    filled with triangulation diagonals (911 of 1755 distinct edges on
 *    `building-architecture.ifc`) that a user can snap to and measure.
 * 2. CLASSIFY: keep boundary and crease edges, drop the diagonals shared by two
 *    coplanar triangles.
 * 3. MERGE collinear runs (`snap-edge-runs.ts`), so a straight model edge that
 *    several triangles cross becomes ONE edge of the length the user sees.

/**
 * Dot-product threshold above which two triangles sharing an edge count as
 * coplanar, so their shared edge is an internal triangulation diagonal rather
 * than a model edge.
 *
 * NEAR-EXACT on purpose. Measured over every two-manifold welded edge of the
 * three committed samples (the `pnpm test:snap-edges` pipeline), the two
 * populations this constant separates do not overlap for five decades:
 *
 * - triangulation diagonals of flat faces sit at dot >= 1 - 8.1e-8, pure f32
 *   position noise (10k+ edges on building-architecture.ifc and
 *   infra-bridge.ifc);
 * - real creases sit at dot <= 1 - 3.66e-5 (0.49 degrees and steeper).
 *
 * 1 - 1e-6 sits between them: 12x above the diagonal noise floor, 36x below
 * the flattest measured crease (both in 1-dot terms). As an angle it is a
 * 0.081 degree cutoff, flatter than any slope BIM geometry encodes on purpose
 * (a 2% drainage fall is 1.15 degrees, a 0.5% minimum interior fall 0.29
 * degrees), so shallow real creases stay snappable. An earlier 0.98 cutoff
 * (~11.5 degrees) deleted them wholesale: 1093 real creases on
 * infra-bridge.ifc alone, among them a 3.500 m bridge-deck edge whose faces
 * meet at 3.617 degrees (IfcBuildingElementProxy #723) - and it cleared the
 * coarsest shipped circle facet (32 segments = 11.25 degrees, dot 0.98079) by
 * only 0.0008, so tessellated arcs kept their edges by luck.
 *
 * The trade is asymmetric and this errs on the KEEP side deliberately: a
 * sliver triangle noisier than the measured floor slips its diagonal under
 * the cutoff and adds a benign extra snap edge on a flat face, while a cutoff
 * low enough to chase such noise deletes real edges a user has to be able to
 * measure. Keeping more edges on curved geometry is the conservative
 * direction for snapping. Pinned from both sides by
 * `snap-geometry-cache.test.ts`.
