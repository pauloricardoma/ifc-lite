/**
 * X-Ray alpha resolution: per ENTITY, and the batch partition that makes a
 * per-entity alpha reachable on the batched draw path.
 *
 * `RenderOptions.transparencyOverrides` is a `Map<expressId, alpha>` and
 * `ghostExceptIds` is a `Set<expressId>` — both name entities. Flat geometry,
 * though, is drawn as merged colour batches with ONE uniform alpha per draw,
 * and the vertices carry no entity lane the shader could branch on. Fading one
 * entity therefore used to fade every batchmate that happened to share its
 * colour (#4129): the caller's X-Ray set held one id and the screen showed a
 * group, so everything keyed on that set (picking, counts, exports) disagreed
 * with what the user saw.
 *
 * The fix reuses the machinery that already draws a SUBSET of a batch — the
 * cached partial sub-batches built for hide/isolate and for colour-override
 * promotion. A batch whose entities resolve to more than one alpha is
 * partitioned into one sub-batch per distinct alpha, each drawn with its own
 * uniform. No vertex format, shader, or pipeline change.
 *
 * The partition is only ever an OPTIMIZATION target, never a correctness
 * requirement: when a batch cannot be partitioned (its CPU geometry was
 * released or evicted, or it is colour-merged — see `Scene.canPartitionBatch`)
 * the caller falls back to drawing it whole at {@link XRayAlpha.forBatch}, the
 * minimum alpha across its non-selected ids. That is the pre-#4129 behaviour,
 * so degrading is a fade that is too wide, never geometry that goes missing.
