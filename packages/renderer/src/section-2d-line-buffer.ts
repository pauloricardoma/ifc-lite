/**
 * One world-space line-list vertex buffer.
 *
 * `Section2DOverlayRenderer` uses this buffer for its standalone world-space
 * line channels. Each channel owns its vertex buffers and vertex counts, while
 * the renderer decides which pipeline and colour to use for a draw.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT an owner of anything shared. The line pipeline, the
 * bind-group layout, the bind group and the 160-byte uniform buffer stay owned
 * solely by `Section2DOverlayRenderer` and are handed in per draw as
 * {@link SectionLinePipelineResources}. That keeps the renderer's single
 * `init()`/`dispose()` lifecycle the one place those resources are created and
 * destroyed (issue #2456).
