 * early return, which reads like a guard but is a magnitude test: every
 * comparison with NaN is false, so `NaN < eps` is false and a malformed pose
 * walked straight past it. Downstream, each of these gestures writes its result
 * back into `camera.position` and `camera.target`, so the consequence is not
 * one bad frame — it is a pose that can never be recovered from, and two of
 * them additionally latch an accumulator that never recovers either.
 *
 * Scope: the gesture side of #2441 — `camera-controls.ts` / `camera-animation.ts`
 * reading the pose back out. The matrix side, where a degenerate pose must not
 * turn `MathUtils.lookAt` or the projection inputs into NaN, lives in
