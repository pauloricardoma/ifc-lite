/**
 * The ONE guard every GPU upload path outside `render()`'s own containment
 * routes through (issue #4885).
 *
 * `render()` and `renderFrame()` already survive a lost or dying device: a
 * pre-check skips the frame, and `containFrameThrow` catches whatever a
 * mid-frame call throws. Every upload call site that runs OUTSIDE that loop —
 * `addMeshes`, `loadGeometry`, `addMesh`, `ensureMeshResources`,
 * `createMeshFromData`, and the viewer's `setAuthoringOverlayMeshes` — has none of
 * that. Before this module, a `device.createBuffer()` on a lost-but-not-yet-
 * `isInitialized()==false` device (see `getGPUDevice()`'s doc: a loss never
 * calls `destroy()`, so the zombie device stays "initialized") threw straight
 * into whatever called it: a React event handler, a store action, a streaming
 * loop. That is how 23 `out_of_memory` events landed for one Edge user in two
 * days — every one of them fallout from a device that had already died.
 */

/**
 * Is this throw the GPU device telling us it is gone?
 *
 * The discriminator is the exception TYPE, not its message, because WebGPU
 * draws exactly that line:
 *  - a call on a dead / invalid-state device throws a `DOMException`
 *    (`InvalidStateError` in Safari 26.5 — the whole of issue #2229);
 *  - host memory pressure on a HEALTHY device throws a plain `RangeError` —
 *    today from the CPU side of an upload (typed-array allocation while
 *    merging geometry: "Array buffer allocation failed"). Until #5429 the
 *    upload's own `createBuffer({ mappedAtCreation: true })` was a second
 *    source ("createBuffer failed, size (…) is too large … when
 *    mappedAtCreation == true", at sizes as small as 672 B); static geometry
 *    now uploads through `gpu-static-upload.ts`'s `createStaticGpuBuffer`,
 *    which never maps at creation and so cannot raise it.
 *
 * Treating the second as a device loss is a false positive that costs the
 * whole session — see `runGuardedGpuUpload`'s doc for how a caught RangeError
 * is instead checked against `isDeviceLost()`, not this classifier, to tell
 * loss fallout from real memory pressure. The one healthy-device
 * `DOMException` an upload could raise — `writeBuffer`'s `OperationError` for
 * a byte count that is not a multiple of 4 — is ruled out by construction:
 * `createStaticGpuBuffer` pads every payload.
 *
 * Shared by `index.ts`'s frame-level `containFrameThrow` (the ONE throw class
 * that latches mid-frame) and this module's `runGuardedGpuUpload` (the same
 * throw class latching from a call OUTSIDE the frame, #4885) — a single
 * classifier, so the two paths cannot drift on what counts as a loss signal.
 *
 * `typeof` guarded because non-DOM hosts (Node before 17, some workers) have
 * no `DOMException` global; there, no throw can be a WebGPU device signal.

 * Never throws: the failure comes back as data, for the caller to log,

 * here: Safari's SYNCHRONOUS `DOMException` (issue #2229) reaches this catch
 * without ever having gone through `handleDeviceLost` — nothing upstream of
 * `run()` calls it, unlike the async `device.lost` promise, which the
 * `WebGPUDevice` wrapper already forwards on its own. Without this callback
 * `isDeviceLost()` would answer `false` forever after such a throw and every
