 * bit-identical distances from the cursor. Run merging removes that particular
 * pair, but distinct edges can still tie (a cursor centred between two parallel
 * edges), so the tiebreak is made geometric and total:
 *
 * 1. closer wins;
 * 2. then the edge that actually spans the cursor (its closest point is
 *    interior, not clamped to an end) — a clamped candidate means the cursor is
 *    off the end of that edge, so it is the worse description of what the user
 *    is pointing along;
 * 3. then the longer run — the more model-like edge, and the one that survives
 *    a retessellation unchanged;
 * 4. then the endpoints lexicographically, which depends on nothing but the
 *    geometry.
