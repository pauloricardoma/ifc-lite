/**
 * `IfcAnnotationFillArea` is the SECOND consumer of the shared cut-cap
 * triangulator (issue #2516), and it reaches it down a different road: a flat
 * `points` buffer split into rings by `holesOffsets`, rather than an explicit
 * outer/holes pair. Testing the kernel alone would leave that split — and the
 * even-odd nesting it feeds — unverified, which is exactly how the annotation
 * path could keep rendering a hollow hatch after the cap path was fixed.
 *
 * So this drives the real `SymbolicFillPipeline.upload()` over a fake device
 * and measures the vertex stream it actually writes to the GPU.
