 * Pull one entity's triangles out of a colour-merged `MeshData`.

 * The colour-merge path packs many entities into a single mesh and tags each
 * VERTEX with its owner in `entityIds`, which is why such a mesh cannot be
 * split by the batch machinery (it is one indivisible piece as far as buffers
 * are concerned). Selection highlighting, per-entity raycast geometry and the
 * snap cache all need just the one entity, so they compact it out here.
