 * Frame/pass timing: mode selection and multi-frame aggregation (issue #2670
 * perf-verdict gate). Pure — see `frame-timing-stats.ts` for the statistics
 * primitives this builds on, and `frame-timing-gpu.ts` for the thin
 * GPU-facing code that produces the raw samples consumed here.
 *
 * Timestamp queries (`GPUQuerySet` of type `'timestamp'`) require the
 * `'timestamp-query'` adapter feature, which is NOT always available — this
 * module's job is to decide, from a plain boolean feature flag, what mode to
 * run in, and to turn raw per-pass nanosecond pairs into the millisecond
 * statistics a caller reads. None of that requires a live device.

 *    Labelled explicitly wherever it is reported: it measures a DIFFERENT
 *    thing (CPU-observed frame cadence, inflated by anything that blocks the
