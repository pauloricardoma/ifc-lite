/**
 * The ghosting decision, tested as a decision (#2606 review).
 *
 * `scene-instanced-ghosting.test.ts` asserts the same behaviour through the
 * bytes actually written to the instance colour lane, which is the proof that
 * matters. These are here because the fast path and the forced re-apply are
 * cheaper to pin down directly than to infer from a write log, and because the
 * planner is the part that can be reasoned about without a device at all.
