/**
 * Safari's SYNCHRONOUS device-loss signal (issue #2229).
 *
 * Chromium surfaces device loss by resolving `device.lost`, which the renderer
 * already listens to. Safari 26.5 instead throws `InvalidStateError` straight
 * out of the next GPU call — in the field, `GPUDevice.createTexture` inside
 * `RenderPipeline.resize()`, reached from the canvas-resize branch of
 * `render()`. That branch sits outside the frame's inner try/catch, so the
 * throw escaped `render()` entirely: the host's rAF loop never reached its
 * tail `requestAnimationFrame`, the viewer froze permanently, and because
 * `device.lost` never resolved, `deviceLost` never latched and no
 * `onDeviceLost` listener ever ran.
 *
 * These tests pin the four properties of the fix, using a renderer whose
 * `pipeline.resize()` throws exactly as Safari's does:
 *   (i)   the throw does not propagate out of render()
 *   (ii)  `deviceLost` latches
 *   (iii) onDeviceLost listeners fire (once)
 *   (iv)  later render() calls are quiet skips, not repeat throws
 *
 * ...and the boundary of that latch: a throw that is NOT a device signal must
 * cost one frame, not the session (see the second describe block).
 */

/**
 * Verbatim Safari 26.5 wording from the PostHog frames in #2229.
 *
 * The TYPE matters as much as the wording: Safari throws a `DOMException`, and
 * the renderer discriminates on exactly that (`isDeviceLossThrow`). A harness
 * throwing a plain `Error` here would exercise the non-latching branch while
 * claiming to reproduce Safari, and every assertion below would invert.
