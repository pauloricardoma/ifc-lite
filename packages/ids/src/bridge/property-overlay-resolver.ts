 * only patches the specific properties it names, so an entity with no
 * overrides sees byte-identical output to the no-overlay path, and an
 * entity WITH overrides keeps every other property untouched.
 *
 * An override's OWN value, however, does still go through unit
 * conversion here (`toBaseSI` below, keyed off the same
 * `resolveEntityMeasureScales` the canonical projection uses): a
 * `PropertyOverride.value` is written in the model's raw storage frame
 * (mirroring `MutablePropertyView.setProperty`), the same frame the
 * canonical projection's OWN properties start in before
 * `projectProperty` scales them — so splicing it in unconverted would
 * leave it in the wrong unit frame relative to its neighbours.
 *
 * Pset/property name matching here is deliberately CASE-INSENSITIVE, to
 * match `getPropertyValue`/`getPropertySets` in ./data-accessor.ts (both
 * compare via `.toLowerCase()`, to tolerate real-world IFC files with
 * inconsistent Pset/property-name casing). An exact-case `find`/`findIndex`
 * here would silently miss a base property whose stored name differs only
 * in case from the override's target: the override would land as a NEW,
 * separately-cased property instead of replacing the existing one, and
 * `getPropertyValue`'s case-insensitive scan would then return the OLD,
 * uncorrected entry (it iterates in array order and the untouched base
 * property comes first) — a correction that reads back as applied through
 * this same accessor (case-insensitively) yet never becomes visible to a
 * re-run of IDS validation through the very same accessor. Matching
 * case-insensitively here, and preserving each existing entry's own
 * stored casing on update, keeps this merge and the read path that
 * consumes it in agreement.
