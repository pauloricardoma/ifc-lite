/**
 * The `xs:date` / `xs:dateTime` / `xs:time` value space (#3721).
 *
 * A regex over digit RUNS decides the lexical shape and nothing else, so
 * `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` accepts `2024-13-45` and `2023-02-29`. XML Schema
 * Part 2 §3.2.7-3.2.9 layers a calendar value space on top of that shape:
 * month 1-12, day within that month under the Gregorian leap rule,
 * hour/minute/second in range with `24:00:00` as the only hour-24 form, and a
 * timezone offset no further out than ±14:00. XSD 1.1's own `explicitPattern`
 * for these types encodes every one of those bounds except day-in-month, which
 * it states as an assertion because no regex can express it.
 *
 * Three places decide the same question — the coherence audit's
 * `xs:restriction @base` check, the facets' strict-cast gate, and (through the
 * first) the `info/date` conformance check in `audit/xsd/index.ts` — so the
 * calendar lives here once instead of in a regex table per caller. Two files
 * import this module; the third consumer arrives through
 * `isValidLexicalForXsType`, which is why the count is not the import count.

 * (`-2024-…`) and the five-digit spelling after 9999 (`10000-…`) stay rejected
 * exactly as they already were. Every quantifier has a fixed length except the
 * fractional second, which is followed only by characters it cannot match, so
 * no input backtracks (#3113).
 *
 * NOT rejected, and this is a PRE-EXISTING gap rather than something this
 * module introduces or fixes: year `0000`. `ids.xsd` is XSD 1.0, which
 * prohibits `0000` outright, and libxml2 duly rejects `0000-01-01`; the old
 * regex accepted it and so does this, because `\d{4}` matches. Measured by
 * differential against libxml2 over 11,261 values: 366 disagreements, ALL of
 * them year 0000, every one of them accepted by the old regex too. Widening
 * the year rule is a separate change with its own upstream-parity question, so
 * it is named here rather than folded into a calendar fix.
