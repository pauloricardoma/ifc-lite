/**
 * buildingSMART's official IDS conformance corpus, run against this package
 * (github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2747).
 *
 * The 318 IDS+IFC pairs under `buildingsmart-ids/` were vendored in #1685 and
 * then referenced by nothing. Their README asserted that "the `corpus.test.ts`
 * test runs the entire corpus"; `git log --all --diff-filter=A` shows no such
 * file has ever existed in this repository, and four source files describe a
 * "corpus-parity harness" consuming the IDS bridge that did not exist either.
 * Five places said the corpus was wired in, which is the likeliest reason
 * nobody noticed that it was not. This file is that harness.
 *
 * ## Why an official corpus, rather than more hand-written fixtures
 *
 * A spec-validation library tested only against models it should accept cannot
 * detect an inverted predicate. #2746 found `matchBounds` had its `xs:length` /
 * `xs:minLength` / `xs:maxLength` inequalities unpinned: inverting all three
 * left the whole package green, because no fixture anywhere built a bounds
 * constraint with those fields. The corpus contains the fixtures for exactly
 * that (`restriction/*max_and_min_length*`), in both directions, and had done
 * all along.
 *
 * ## The three prefixes route to two different entry points
 *
 * `pass-` and `fail-` are questions about a MODEL: the IDS is well-formed and
 * the answer is whether the IFC satisfies it, which is `validateIDS`.
 * `invalid-` is a question about the IDS DOCUMENT: the file is not conforming
 * IDS, so the validator is the wrong judge of it and `auditIDSDocument` is the
 * right one. Routing every prefix through the validator was measured first and
 * reports `fail` for all 27 `invalid-` cases, which is not wrong so much as an
 * answer to a different question.
 *
 * Assertions are PER SPECIFICATION, not per file. A file-level aggregate ("did
 * anything fail?") can be green while individual specifications disagree in
 * compensating directions, which would make this corpus test one more thing
 * that cannot observe what it claims. Every corpus file currently holds exactly
 * one specification and `EXPECTED_SPECS_PER_FILE` pins that, so a future corpus
 * update introducing a multi-specification case fails here loudly instead of
 * being silently averaged.
 *
 * ## Licence
 *
 * The corpus is (c) buildingSMART International Ltd under CC BY-ND 4.0 (see
 * `buildingsmart-ids/UPSTREAM_LICENSE`). NoDerivatives: this harness only ever
 * READS the vendored files. Nothing here rewrites a fixture, and a test needing
 * a variant must build it in memory rather than committing a modified copy.
