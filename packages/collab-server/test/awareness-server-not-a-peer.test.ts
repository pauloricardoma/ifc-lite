/**
 * The server relays awareness; it is not itself a peer (#2791).
 *
 * y-protocols' `Awareness` constructor self-registers a local state of `{}` for
 * its own clientID, so `new Awareness(this.doc)` inside `Room` used to publish
 * the SERVER as a participant. Every client counted it, so every room badge
 * read one too high: "(2)" directly above a roster reading "You're the only
 * one here", because the roster filters on a `user` field and the badge did
 * not.
 *
 * How the ghost actually reached clients, measured rather than assumed: NOT via
 * the connect-time snapshot in `addConnection`, but via the ~15s renewal. A
 * lone client polled every 2s saw only itself through t=14s and picked up a
 * second, empty state at t=16s, which then persisted. That matches the
 * production observation this was filed from (t=18s, one remote peer, `{}`).
 * `_checkInterval` in y-protocols/awareness.js:59-63 re-sets the local state
 * once `outdatedTimeout / 2` (15s) has elapsed, which broadcasts it.
 *
 * The second test therefore drives that exact renewal call instead of sleeping
 * for 15s of wall clock. The third test is the no-regression half: clearing the
 * server's own state must not stop it forwarding real peers to each other.
