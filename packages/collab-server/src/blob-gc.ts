/**
 * Garbage collection for content-addressed blobs.
 *
 * Blobs are one file per mesh and, until this module, were NEVER deleted:
 * `retention.ts` covers room LOGS only and `bin.ts` wired no blob retention.
 * That is why production ran out of INODES rather than bytes (#2790): 305,741
 * blobs against a 5 GB volume's 305,175 inodes, with only 2.9 GB of 4.9 GB
 * used. Mean blob size is well under the 16 KB-per-inode default ratio, so
 * inodes exhaust before bytes at ANY volume size. Growing the volume buys
 * time; this is the structural fix.
 *
 * # Safety model
 *
 * Deleting a referenced blob is silent, permanent geometry loss, so the sweep
 * is built to fail CLOSED. It deletes a blob only when ALL of these hold:
 *
 *  1. No PERSISTED room log references it. Every `*.log` in the data dir is
 *     read, not just the rooms currently loaded in memory - a room that is
 *     merely idle must not have its geometry collected.
 *  2. No LOADED room references it. A room whose newest updates have not yet
 *     been compacted to disk is covered by the live scan.
 *  3. It is older than `graceMs`. Clients PUT a blob and only then write its
 *     hash into the doc (`geometry-sync.ts`), so a fresh blob is legitimately
 *     unreferenced for a moment. The grace window covers that race.
 *
 * Blobs are shared BETWEEN rooms: the same content hash is reused by any room
 * with the same mesh, and branch forks copy refs into sibling rooms without
 * re-uploading. So references are unioned across every room and a blob
 * survives if ANY room still points at it.
 *
 * # Absence must not read as success
 *
 * Every way of "seeing no references" that is not genuinely "no references"
 * aborts the whole sweep rather than deleting:
 *
 *  - an unreadable log directory, an undecodable room name, or a doc that
 *    throws on `applyUpdate`
 *  - **a non-empty log file that `FilePersistence.load` returns `null` for.**
 *    `load` does not throw on a corrupt log: an empty file, a truncated length
 *    prefix, or any garbage yielding zero complete frames all return `null`
 *    (`persistence.ts`). Treating that as "this room references nothing" would
 *    delete every blob belonging to a damaged room. A genuinely 0-byte log is
 *    the one safe case, since it cannot hide a reference.
 *  - zero room logs found while blobs exist, which is what a mispointed
 *    `dataDir` looks like.
