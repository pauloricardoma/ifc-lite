/**
 * Parsing of the request target (`req.url`), which the client controls.
 *
 * `new URL(target, base)` throws `TypeError` for targets such as `//`, and
 * `decodeURIComponent` throws `URIError` for a malformed percent-escape such
 * as `%E0%A4%A`. Both are errors in ONE client's request, so they are
 * returned as `null` for the caller to answer (400 / close 4400) instead of
 * being thrown into a handler that reports them as a server fault.
 *
 * This is the only place a request path is decoded into a room id. It is the
 * counterpart of `isIllFormedRoomId` in `room-token.ts`, which checks a room id
 * that arrives in a request BODY: a decoded path can never hold an unpaired
 * surrogate, so the two checks cover disjoint inputs and neither repeats the other.
