/**
 * How a {@link ContentMatch} relates its `base` and `head` members (issue
 * #1891, `DiffOptions.matchUnpairedByContent`):
 *
 * - `renamed`      — the base and head members share a data hash AND a world
 *   geometry hash: same content, same place, different key (re-GUID/rename).
 *   Usually one entity per side; a group of `N` per side is reported as one
 *   `renamed` match when both sides agree on both hashes `N` times over,
 *   because every bijection between them is then indistinguishable.
 * - `moved`        — one base and one head entity share a data hash but not a
 *   geometry hash, and their bounding boxes are the same size in every axis
 *   while their centres are further apart than `DiffOptions.moveTolerance`.
 *   Without an {@link EntityFingerprint.aabb} on both sides this is also what
 *   a bare geometry-hash difference reports, since nothing can tell a move
 *   from a reshape.
 * - `reshaped`     — one base and one head entity share a data hash but not a
 *   geometry hash, and their bounding boxes differ in size beyond
 *   `DiffOptions.reshapeTolerance` — or agree entirely, which is what a reshape
 *   confined to the interior looks like. A pure re-triangulation of an
 *   unchanged surface no longer lands here (the geometry hash is
 *   retriangulation-invariant), but a re-tessellation that introduces new
 *   vertices still does, and a bounding box genuinely cannot separate that from
 *   an interior reshape. This kind does not pretend otherwise.
 * - `duplicated`   — one base entity's content matches several head entities
 *   (it looks like it was copied).
 * - `deduplicated` — several base entities' content matches one head entity
 *   (they look like they were merged into one).
 * - `ambiguous`    — several candidates remain on both sides with no
 *   principled pairing: the engine could not tell duplication from
 *   deduplication, or positions were symmetric enough that no base was any
 *   head's unique nearest neighbour, or the only candidates were further apart
 *   than `DiffOptions.maxMoveDistance`.

/**
 * WHICH refinement tier inside a content bucket produced a match — the

 *
 * - `geometry-hash` — TIER 1. The base and head entities landed in the same
 *   world-geometry-hash sub-bucket, `N` per side. The strongest evidence the
 *   pass has: data and world shape+position agree.
 * - `residue-1-1`   — TIER 2. Exactly one base and one head were left in the
 *   bucket after tier 1, and they agreed on `ifcType` and every component
 *   sub-hash. This is the pass's only destructive path resting on the data
 *   hash alone.
 * - `positional`    — TIER 3. An N:M leftover paired by iterated mutual
 *   nearest neighbour on bounding-box centres.
 * - `unresolved`    — nothing was retired; the record is a reported group
 *   (`duplicated` / `deduplicated` / `ambiguous`).
 *
 * Reported so a caller can weigh a match by the evidence behind it, and so a
 * validation harness can score the tiers separately — an aggregate number
 * hides a tier that has stopped firing behind the tiers that still do.
 * `undefined` only where a producer predates this field.
