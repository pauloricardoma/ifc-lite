/**
 * The successor stage (issue #4955): claims that one deleted entity was
 * REPLACED IN PLACE by one added entity, when neither the data hash nor the
 * geometry hash agrees.
 *
 * Content matching needs one of the two hashes to agree; split/merge needs
 * volumes to conserve. A wall whose buildup was changed (thicker, different
 * layer set, re-measured quantities, often re-named) and a chair swapped for a
 * different family agree on nothing a hash can see. What they do share is
 * WHERE they are, and this stage argues from that alone — which is why it is
 * the weakest stage in the engine and why it never decides anything:
 *
 * - it runs LAST, on what content matching and split/merge left unbound, so
 *   the nearest piece of a split is never offered as the whole's successor;
 * - it retires nothing and touches no count (`ModelDiff.successors` is
 *   additive, like `splitMerges`);
 * - it mints no identity entry unattended: {@link identityMapFromSuccessors}
 *   takes only what a caller explicitly accepted.
 *
 * Two profiles, evaluated in order, each requiring a pairing that is UNIQUE IN
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS with a margin. A tie, or a runner-up inside the margin, is an
 * abstention: two candidates that both explain a position carry no information
 * about which one it became (`mutual-nearest.ts`, #1923).
 *
 * **`footprint`** — bounding-box intersection over union. A thickening that
 * nests the old box in the new one scores `V_old / V_new`, so a 200 → 250 mm
 * wall is 0.8 whichever face moved, a 200 → 350 mm wall is 0.57 and misses,
 * and a 100 mm axis shift at 200 mm is 0.33 and misses. An axis-shifted redraw
 * is exactly the case this profile misses and `position` must carry.
 *
 * **`position`** — same class family, same spatial container (a NAME path both
 * adapters resolve, equal and non-empty on both sides — absent on either side
 * is not evidence and the pair is skipped), boxes of comparable size (no axis
 * more than 2× the other's), centre distance within
 * `max(successorDistance, 0.5 × base box diagonal)`, mutual nearest with the
 * runner-up at least twice as far. `footprint` ignores the container on
 * purpose: a storey rename changes the path of every element in it, and a
 * heavy box overlap is stronger evidence than a matching name.
