/**
 * Lineage (issue #4955): the durable, 1:k answer to "for old key K, which new
 * keys carry its data forward, and by what relation?"
 *
 * An identity map is 1:1 by contract — identity is not a relation that
 * survives being split — and it stays that way. A downstream system that keyed
 * external data (cost lines, inspection records, room bookings) on GlobalIds
 * needs something wider: when a wall becomes three walls, the data has to go
 * SOMEWHERE, and "orphaned" is one honest answer but not the only one. A
 * lineage entry records the relation the engine (or a reviewer) established
 * and lets the external side pick its own policy: copy to every piece, follow
 * the largest share, or refuse.
 *
 * Four relations, each with a different source in a `ModelDiff`:
 *
 * - `identity` — from a content match the engine COMMITTED to (the same
 *   entries `identityMapFromContentMatches` mints), and from an applied alias
 *   whose incoming lineage explicitly recorded identity (otherwise a fresh
 *   alias whose reason is not a successor's).
 * - `split` / `merge` — from `ModelDiff.splitMerges`, verbatim: one base to k
 *   heads, or k bases to one head, with the confidence in the reason.
 * - `replaced` — from successor claims a caller passed in as accepted
 *   (`options.accepted`), and from an applied alias whose incoming lineage
 *   explicitly recorded replacement (otherwise a fresh alias whose reason
 *   carries the successor prefix). The engine never promotes a mere
 *   suggestion to lineage on its own.
 *
 * Every key appears in at most one entry, on either side. The engine already
 * guarantees that (content matching retires; split/merge resolves conflicts;
 * successors run on what is left), and the sidecar refuses a document where it
 * does not hold — a key with two lineages is a document that has not decided.
