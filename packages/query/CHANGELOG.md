# @ifc-lite/query

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#3009](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3009) [`131e3dc`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/131e3dc84244d9dd24859a5923ef0aef4d6119c4) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - **Breaking:** `IfcQuery.ofType()` now throws for a type string that is not an IFC entity name, instead of silently querying the `Unknown` bucket.
  
  `ofType()` maps each type string through `IfcTypeEnumFromString`, which falls back to `IfcTypeEnum.Unknown` for any name it does not recognize. A typo — `ofType('IfcWal')` — therefore returned every entity whose type the store could not classify: neither the caller's walls nor an empty result, but some other, unrelated set of entities. `ofType()` now rejects such a string with an error naming it.
  
  What still works unchanged:
  
  - **Standard IFC types that this build's enum table does not map.** `TYPE_STRING_TO_ENUM` (`@ifc-lite/data`) is a curated subset of IFC, so standard buildingSMART types such as `IfcChiller`, `IfcActuator`, `IfcElectricAppliance` — and IFC2X3's `IfcDoorStyle`, `IfcWindowStyle` and `IfcElectricalDistributionPoint` — resolve to `Unknown`. These are **not** rejected: they keep falling through to the `Unknown` bucket exactly as before, which is the only representation this build has for them and which answers the query correctly in a file whose unclassified entities are of that type.
  
    The oracle deciding this is `isKnownType()` (`@ifc-lite/parser`), the predicate that already guards `@ifc-lite/sdk`'s `addEntity`: the bundled **IFC2X3 + IFC4 + IFC4X3** schema union, minus EXPRESS defined types (`IfcLengthMeasure`, `IfcArcIndex`), with the IFC4_ADD2_TC1 codegen pin as a fallback, plus the parser's alias table for IFC2X3 leaves the bundled EXPRESS exports omit. Reusing it rather than adding a second name table keeps one source of truth for "is this a real IFC class". The suite asserts the coverage exhaustively — every entity in `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` and in all three per-version tables must pass `ofType()` — rather than by sampling names.
  - **The `Unknown` bucket itself**, still reachable by passing the literal string `'Unknown'`.
  
  Surrounding whitespace is trimmed once, and the trimmed name feeds both the enum lookup and the acceptance check. `IfcTypeEnumFromString` only uppercases, so before this a padded `ofType(' IfcWall ')` missed the enum table and resolved to `Unknown` while the check — which did trim — found `IfcWall` known and let it through: the query then ran against the `Unknown` bucket and returned entities that are not walls, with no error. For a name with no surrounding whitespace the trim is the identity, so nothing that resolved correctly before resolves differently now.
  
  What breaks: a call passing a name that is not an IFC entity name in any of those schemas — a typo, or a genuine vendor-specific type name — previously returned an `EntityQuery` over the `Unknown` bucket and now throws. Callers relying on a vendor-specific name to reach unclassified entities must pass `'Unknown'` instead. Hence the major bump: this is a behaviour change on a published SDK export, not a bug fix that is invisible to correct callers.
  
  The error text says which schemas were searched rather than assuming a misspelling, because a rejected name may well be spelled correctly:
  
  > `ofType(): "IfcWal" is not an entity name in any IFC schema this build reads (IFC2X3, IFC4, IFC4X3). Check the spelling; for a vendor-specific type name, pass 'Unknown' to query entities whose type could not be classified.`

### Minor Changes

- [#3034](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3034) [`75867a7`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/75867a7e6ebf51b2da47cab14242bcd71787ba3b) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Stop dropping entities from an unfiltered query, and stop reporting their class as `Unknown`, when the curated `IfcTypeEnum` does not carry it.
  
  **`isProductType` now keys on the inheritance chain.** It gated on `IfcTypeEnumFromString(type) !== Unknown`, and `TYPE_STRING_TO_ENUM` is a curated 138-entry subset — the same table PR [#3009](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3009) found rejecting standard buildingSMART classes. An unfiltered `bim.query()` walks `store.entityIndex.byType` and keeps only entries this predicate accepts, so every class outside those 138 was absent from the result with nothing to say so. On a 176k-entity MEP model that was every `IfcAirTerminal` (139), every `IfcDuctFitting` (383) and every `IfcDistributionPort` (2,053): 2,575 real elements, reported as not present rather than as unclassified.
  
  The gate is now `isQueryableObjectType` in `@ifc-lite/parser`: `getInheritanceChain(type).includes('IfcObjectDefinition')`, minus `IfcTypeObject` descendants. It lives in the parser rather than in each backend because `isProductType` was a verbatim copy in `packages/cli` and `packages/mcp` and only the CLI copy had tests — a predicate that had just diverged once should not be left in two places to diverge again. Both backends now alias the single implementation and keep publishing it under the old name. That is the exact line the four prefix tests were approximating: `IfcObjectDefinition` covers products, type objects, groups, systems and `IfcContext`, and excludes the other two `IfcRoot` branches, `IfcPropertyDefinition` and `IfcRelationship`. The chain resolves across the bundled schema union, so it answers for classes the pin omits. `IFC_ENTITY_NAMES` alone would not work here: it carries all ~880 classes, so keying on "is a known IFC name" floods the same query with that model's 42,024 `IfcCartesianPoint`.
  
  The MCP `dataQuality` audit counts the same set, so its score moves for an unchanged file: ports, groups, systems and annotations now enter the naming denominator that the 138-entry table kept out, and most of them are unnamed.
  
  **Behaviour change worth planning for:** on that model an unfiltered `bim.query()` returns 3,090 entities where it returned 515. The growth is real elements that were missing, and it is dominated by ports on MEP models. Callers that want the narrower set should filter with `byType`.
  
  **`EntityNode.type` no longer answers `Unknown` for an entity the product table does not index.** `store.entities` indexes products, so `getTypeName` has no row for `IfcPropertySet`, `IfcElementQuantity`, `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` or `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial` and answered `'Unknown'` for all four, while `entityIndex.byId` carried the class the whole time as the raw uppercase STEP token. `type` is what callers key passes on, so iterating a model's classes by it skipped 8,928 entities on that same model. It now falls back to the index and canonicalises through `normalizeIfcTypeName`, which resolves against the bundled schema union. `IFC_ENTITY_NAMES` would have been the same curated-subset trap one file over: it is ~880 hand-maintained entries whose generator script no longer exists, so an `IfcMove` on an IFC2X3 model came back as the raw `IFCMOVE` token — a second wrong answer.
  
  `QueryResultEntity.type`, which is what `EntityQuery.execute()` returns, carried the identical getter and is fixed with it. Both now call one `resolveEntityTypeName`; fixing only `EntityNode` would have left the two disagreeing on the same entity.
  
  Verified against the real columnar parser, not only against the query package's mock store. With both changes reverted, 3 of the 5 new CLI tests fail and 1 of the 4 new query tests fails; the two CLI tests that still pass are the ones asserting what stays excluded.

## 1.14.17

### Patch Changes

- [#2861](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2861) [`2156528`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/2156528c926114233c79ba74925c0c8656f1ea65) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `ifc-lite query`'s DuckDB SQL integration reading a NULL string-typed property as an empty string instead of SQL `NULL`.
  
  `createPropertiesTable` (duckdb-integration.ts) resolved `PropertyTable.valueString` with `valueStringIdx >= 0 ? ... : ''`. `valueString` is a `Uint32Array`, so the NULL sentinel written by `StringTable.intern(null)` (-1) wraps to 4294967295 rather than going negative — the `>= 0` check was always true and never caught it, and the row was inserted with `value_string = ''`, indistinguishable from a genuine empty-string property. `WHERE value_string IS NULL` silently matched nothing.
  
  Two siblings on the same column family already guard this correctly: `getPropertyValue`'s String branch in `@ifc-lite/data`'s `property-table.ts` and its cache-restored twin in `@ifc-lite/cache`'s `properties.ts`, both checking `idx < strings.count`. This DuckDB path is named as a sibling in `property-table.ts`'s own doc comment ("the on-demand fallback in `@ifc-lite/query`") but used an independent, unguarded decode. The fix extracts the shared logic into `resolveDuckDBStringLiteral` and applies the same in-range check, emitting the bare `NULL` keyword — matching how this same file already handles the `containedInStorey`/`definedByType` sentinels a few lines above.

- [#2907](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2907) [`b7d2a11`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b7d2a11345add8acdf0926ade5d4c1ca19ccecf7) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `PropertyTable.getProperty` returning null when an entity carries two property sets with the same name and the property lives only on the second one.
  
  `getProperty` stopped scanning at the first pset whose name matched, and returned whatever that pset had for the property (`null` if it lacked it) instead of continuing to the next same-named pset. `findEntities`, right below it in the same class, already handled two same-named psets correctly by scanning all of them; `getProperty` now does the same — it keeps checking subsequent same-named sets until it finds the property, matching the semantics IFC's `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` allows (an entity can be targeted by more than one property set sharing a name).

### Patch Changes

- [#2218](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2218) [`d260a35`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d260a35669e379e5f465861294391c95ee48cb3d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix three `EntityNode` relationship helpers that traversed the graph in the wrong direction.

  The parser builds every edge as `addEdge(relatingObject, relatedObject)` (`columnar-parser.ts:476`), so `forward` always means relating → related. Three helpers were oriented against that:

  - `filledBy()` used `inverse`. `IfcRelFillsElement` is `(RelatingOpeningElement, RelatedBuildingElement)`, so the opening is the source and the filler the target — reaching the filler from the opening is a forward traversal. As written the method returned an empty array for every opening, which is indistinguishable from "this opening has no filler".
  - `definingType()` used `forward` and `instances()` used `inverse`. `IfcRelDefinesByType` has the type as its relating object, so the type is the source and each occurrence the target; both helpers were the wrong way round. The element → type lookups in `on-demand-extractors.ts` already used `inverse` for this, so the two disagreed.

  `filledBy()` is the one with an observable consequence today: `@ifc-lite/clash` calls `opening.filledBy()` to exclude a host element from clashing with the door or window filling its own opening (`adapters/step.ts:172`). Because the call always returned nothing, that exclusion never fired and every door and window could report a false-positive clash against the opening it legitimately fills. `definingType()` and `instances()` have no in-repo callers, so their fix is latent — but they are public API.

  The gap survived because the unit-test fixture encoded the reverse orientation for `IfcRelDefinesByType`, so the mock and the reversed code agreed with each other. The fixture is corrected to match the parser, and `IfcRelFillsElement` — previously absent from it entirely — is now covered.

- [#2321](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2321) [`51ec81b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/51ec81b125532cd0efe4f004c7ab01f4efe55cb8) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `EntityQuery.first()` permanently capping the query it was called on. `first()` narrowed the result set by calling `this.limit(1)` — which mutates the query object itself rather than a clone — so the cap outlived the call: every subsequent `execute()`, `ids()` or `first()` on the same query returned at most one row. A caller's own explicit `limit(n)` was overwritten too, silently collapsing to 1.

  Building a query, peeking at the first match, then iterating it in full is ordinary usage of a fluent query API, and `EntityQuery` is published surface — so "no in-repo caller does that" is not a defence here, the same reasoning applied to `ParquetExporter`'s un-memoised overlay index in the [#2111](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2111) review.

  `first()` now narrows for the duration of the call only, restoring whatever limit was previously set rather than clearing it.

### Patch Changes

- [#1935](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1935) [`9a7b5a2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9a7b5a2fc1bb85ce60e954ccf7819829e43431d6) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - fix(query): make `whereProperty` actually filter STEP-parsed models

  `EntityQuery.whereProperty()` returned `[]` for every `.ifc` (STEP) model, for
  any property-set name, silently — no error, no warning. `applyPropertyFilters`
  only consulted `store.properties.findByProperty`, but a STEP parse deliberately
  leaves the columnar property/quantity tables empty and routes reads through the
  on-demand maps (issue [#577](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/577)), so that lookup could only ever return nothing. The
  read path (`EntityNode.property`, `QueryResultEntity.getProperty`) resolved the
  same data correctly, so a model that plainly carried the property still filtered
  to nothing. [#577](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/577) / [#578](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/578) fixed this class on the read path and left the filter
  path behind; this is that other half.

  `whereProperty` now picks a strategy per store. When the property table reports
  an explicit zero row count it resolves the surviving candidates through
  `store.getProperties` / `store.getQuantities`, the same accessors the read path
  uses; otherwise it answers off the table's name indices as before. Only an
  explicit zero selects the fallback — a duck-typed store whose table omits the
  optional `count` keeps the indexed path, because every store written before
  `count` existed implements `findByProperty` for real. The fallback is
  candidate-scoped, and each entity is resolved at most once _per source_ across
  all filters: property sets and quantity sets have separate caches, so an entity
  reached by both sides costs one `getProperties` and one `getQuantities`, never
  one per filter.
  Nothing is materialised onto `store.properties`, so IDS keeps reading the richer
  on-demand property shape.

  Quantity sets are folded into the same call on every store, making the
  documented `whereProperty('Qto_WallBaseQuantities', 'NetSideArea', '>', 10)`
  form work; previously a `Qto_` filter matched nothing on any path.

  Matching is ANY-match: an entity passes when any property of that name, in any
  set of that name, satisfies the operator. That is what
  `PropertyTable.findByProperty` already did, so the two strategies agree with
  each other. It deliberately differs from the single-value read path, which
  returns the first match — the two disagree only for an entity carrying the same
  property twice, and that divergence is pinned by a test.

  `@ifc-lite/data` gains two additive optional interface members and one new
  export: `QuantityTable.findByQuantity` (the quantity mirror of `findByProperty`,
  answered off the quantity-name index), `count` on `IfcStoreBase`'s property and
  quantity tables, and `comparePropertyValues` — the definition of property-filter
  comparison semantics shared by the store-level property tables (same-type only,
  `null` never matches, `==` aliases `=`). `@ifc-lite/cache` and the viewer's
  server-converted store now use
  `comparePropertyValues` instead of local copies: the cache copy had no boolean
  branch, so a cache-restored `findByProperty('IsExternal', '=', true)` silently
  returned `[]`, and the server copy ignored the operator entirely and compared
  with `===`, so `'>' 60` answered `= 60`.

  **Cost.** Filtering a STEP model is now real work where it used to be an instant
  wrong answer. The shape of that work: the filter resolves property sets **per
  candidate**, so cost is proportional to how many entities reach the filter, not
  to how many carry the property. Scope with `ofType(...)` / `onStorey(...)` before
  `whereProperty(...)` — an unscoped `query.all().whereProperty(...)` resolves
  every entity in the model. The guide and the package README now say so.

  This per-candidate path covers more than a fresh `.ifc` parse. A cache written
  from a STEP parse serialises the empty property table verbatim, so a
  cache-restored `.ifc` model reports `count === 0` and takes the same fallback;
  the viewer's server-converted store reports `count: 0` too. What decides the
  path is the store rather than the file format: a store carrying table rows is
  answered from the index, and one reporting no rows resolves per candidate.

  Those indexed stores are deliberately kept off the per-candidate path: folding
  quantities by resolving every candidate would have made a `Qto_` filter cost
  them per candidate as well, so the quantity side goes through the new
  `findByQuantity` name index instead. Where an indexed store's cost moves at all
  it is because the query is answered rather than silently returning nothing — a
  `Qto_` filter that used to match zero entities now matches the real set.

  `EntityQuery.whereProperty(psetName, propName, ...)` recorded the property-set
  name but never passed it to `findByProperty`, so a property matched in _any_
  property set — e.g. filtering `Pset_WallCommon.IsExternal` also returned doors
  whose `Pset_DoorCommon.IsExternal` matched. `findByProperty` gains an optional
  `psetName` argument (honored by the in-memory, cache-restored, and
  server-converted property tables), and `whereProperty` now passes it. An unknown
  pset name matches nothing.

## 1.14.9

### Patch Changes

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

  `parseColumnar` intentionally leaves the pre-parsed `store.properties` / `store.quantities` tables empty and populates `onDemandPropertyMap` / `onDemandQuantityMap` instead, but `QueryResultEntity` only read from the empty pre-parsed tables. As a result `query.ofType(...).includeProperties().includeQuantities().execute()` always returned elements with empty `properties` / `quantities`, even when the IFC file contained them (issue #577).

  `loadPropertiesFromStore` / `loadQuantitiesFromStore` in `query-result-entity.ts` now fall back to `extractPropertiesOnDemand` / `extractQuantitiesOnDemand` when the pre-parsed tables are empty and the on-demand maps are present. This applies to the `properties` / `quantities` getters, the `loadProperties` / `loadQuantities` eager loaders, and the `getProperty()` accessor.

  Also normalizes untagged STEP enumeration tokens (`.T.` / `.F.` / `.U.` / `.X.`) emitted by some authoring tools in the `NominalValue` slot of `IfcPropertySingleValue`: `.T.` / `.F.` now decode to real JS booleans and `.U.` / `.X.` to a Logical `null`, matching the behavior of the conformant `IFCBOOLEAN(...)` / `IFCLOGICAL(...)` typed form.
