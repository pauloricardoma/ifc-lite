Used by the chart source filter ([#4946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4946)) so a selector carrying an NBSP is never silently rewritten before it reaches the parser.

Resolve named attributes across every bundled IFC schema so IFC2X3-only and IFC4X3-only classes participate too (`EntityNode.allAttributes()` now consults the store's own schema version). On-demand property extraction reports a property's explicit `Unit` as `unit` plus `unitSiScale`; an unresolvable unit reference is reported as `#<id>` with no scale instead of being dropped.

One of the comments claimed a "can't drift" guarantee the code never actually enforced. Both packages already depend on `@ifc-lite/query` for the helpers this function is built from, so there is now exactly one implementation, exported from `@ifc-lite/query`, that both `HeadlessBackend` (CLI) and the MCP backend import. No behavior change.

- [#4774](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4774) [`7b34e97`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7b34e97f2abdc49be3eef78031d52d1107622544) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Added `selectorToQueryDescriptor` and `SelectorUnsupportedError`, translating IfcOpenShell-style selector text (already parsed by `parseSelector`) to the `{ types, filters }` shape `bim.query()` executes. Class terms remain normalized base names so each backend expands them against each executing model's own IFC schema, including mixed-schema federations. Only the lossless subset (class terms, exact-name `Pset_`/`Qto_` comparisons across the `=`/`!=`/`>`/`>=`/`<`/`<=`/`*=` operators, a `/regex/` value on `=`, and `Prop!=NULL` for existence) translates; every other construct (regex pset/property names, `!*=`, a regex value on any operator but `=`, `Prop=NULL`, entity-attribute terms, `!` class negation, `+` group unions, `parent=`, `query:`, `material=`/`classification=`/`location=`) throws `SelectorUnsupportedError` naming it, rather than silently running an empty or partial query. This is the shared translator behind `@ifc-lite/sdk`'s `QueryBuilder.select()`.

### Patch Changes

- [#4672](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4672) [`6d8ebeb`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6d8ebebb7cd8722534ff1ad7817cf7a7d0191aaf) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `extractRelFast`'s hand-written per-STEP-keyword branch ladder (`packages/parser/src/columnar-parser-relationships.ts`) is replaced by a single schema-derived algorithm: for any `IfcRelationship` subtype, the relating (single-reference) and related (reference-or-list) attribute positions are read straight from the codegen-generated schema registries, keyed by the `Relating*`/`Related*` EXPRESS naming convention, not a hand-typed table. `HIERARCHY_REL_TYPES` (the gate that decides which STEP keywords ever reach relationship extraction) is derived the same way, from every concrete `IfcRelationship` subtype across the bundled IFC2X3/IFC4/IFC4X3 registries, replacing an enumeration that [#3964](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3964), [#3237](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3237) and [#1075](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1075) each landed because it was missing one more class.
  
  17 previously wholly-unindexed relationship classes (`IfcRelAssignsToActor`, `IfcRelAssignsToResource`, `IfcRelAssignsToProcess`, `IfcRelAssignsToControl`, `IfcRelAssociatesConstraint`, `IfcRelAssociatesApproval`, `IfcRelAssociatesLibrary`, `IfcRelDeclares`, `IfcRelInterferesElements`, `IfcRelCoversBldgElements`, `IfcRelCoversSpaces`, `IfcRelServicesBuildings`, `IfcRelProjectsElement`, `IfcRelFlowControlElements`, `IfcRelSequence`, and the IFC4X3-only `IfcRelPositions`/`IfcRelAdheresToElement`) each get their own `RelationshipType` enum member and edge, instead of being invisible to the relationship graph. `RelationshipType`-keyed name maps in `relationship-graph.ts`, `parquet-exporter.ts`, `cache/sections/relationships.ts` and `duckdb-integration.ts` were extended for exhaustiveness; the last of those was also converted from a non-exhaustive `Record<number, string>` to `Record<RelationshipType, string>` (it had silently been missing `ConnectsPortToElement`, `ConnectsPorts` and `AssociatesDocument` since they were added).
  
  A handful of concrete relationship subtypes (`IfcRelDefinesByObject`, `IfcRelDefinesByTemplate`, `IfcRelConnectsStructuralActivity`, `IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember`, `IfcRelConnectsWithEccentricity`, `IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements`, `IfcRelSpaceBoundary1stLevel`/`2ndLevel`, plus ten IFC2X3-legacy classes such as `IfcRelAssignsTasks`) now pass the schema-derived gate but still have no dedicated `RelationshipType`/edge — a deliberately scoped remainder, not a regression, tracked against [#4205](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4205).

### Patch Changes

- [#4504](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4504) [`3af8c93`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3af8c938050373cf95c09502573dead0fd425467) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `EntityNode.containedIn()` now resolves duplicate containment against the same reachable-node set `elementToStorey` uses, so the two APIs agree.
  
  When an element is duplicate-declared in more than one `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` edge (a malformed file naming the same element from two different storeys) and the first-declared storey is itself an orphan with no `IfcRelAggregates` edge back to `IfcProject`, `containedIn()` used to return that orphan while `SpatialHierarchyBuilder`'s `elementToStorey` fell through to the reachable, later-declared storey — two APIs answering "which storey is this element on" with a present but different value.
  
  `SpatialHierarchy` gains an optional `reachableSpatialNodes` set, which `SpatialHierarchyBuilder` fills from the `computeReachableSpatialNodes` call it already made when resolving `elementToStorey`, and which survives the worker transport. `containedIn()` reads that set rather than deciding reachability for itself, so the two answers come from one computation and cannot drift. First-declared still wins among reachable containers, and `containedIn()` falls back to the first-declared candidate when no candidate is reachable or the store carries no spatial hierarchy, so a disconnected spatial tree never turns a present answer into `null`.

- [#4496](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4496) [`511e488`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/511e488a8de2b90f7d5f7663911873a92b3427c7) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix two of the relationship-graph folds named in [#4205](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4205) that lost information at parse time:
  
  - `IfcRelNests` was indexed onto the exact same `RelationshipType.Aggregates` edge as `IfcRelAggregates`, with no way to tell a nesting edge apart from a real decomposition edge once indexed. It now also lands on a distinct `RelationshipType.Nests` edge (in addition to the existing `Aggregates` edge, so every current consumer — spatial hierarchy, decomposition, the IDS `partOf`/ancestors bridge — is unaffected).
  - `IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor` was indexed onto the same `RelationshipType.AssignsToGroup` edge as a plain `IfcRelAssignsToGroup`, and its `Factor` attribute was unreachable from the relationship graph. It now also lands on a distinct `RelationshipType.AssignsToGroupByFactor` edge, and `extractGroupAssignmentFactorOnDemand(store, groupId, memberId)` resolves the `Factor` value (`undefined`, not `0`, when the assignment is plain or absent).
  
  This is a narrow fix for the two folds the issue calls out as live defects, not the full schema-derived relationship-edge migration [#4205](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4205) also scopes — the hand-written 17-value `RelationshipType` enum and the hand-written relating/related attribute slots are unchanged.
  
  Two follow-up fixes for consumers that don't filter by relationship type and so double-counted or mislabeled the new secondary edges:
  
  - `ParquetExporter`'s `Metadata.json` `statistics.relationshipCount` counted raw graph edges, so a model with `IfcRelNests`/`IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor` relationships reported one extra per such relationship (the new secondary edge counted alongside its broad-bucket edge). It now counts distinct `IfcRel*` records instead.
  - The DuckDB-backed `relationships` SQL table (`@ifc-lite/query`) rendered `rel_type` as `'Unknown'` for both new types — its type→string map was missed when the other three were updated. Added, with the same display strings as those three maps.

### Minor Changes

- [#4356](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4356) [`ced8bb4`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ced8bb46c368648bd54a1bab716d049143faa036) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Surface ambiguous direct storey containment as a detectable signal ([#4311](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4311)), a follow-up to the first-declared-wins tie-break from [#4248](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4248)/[#4310](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4310).
  
  An element can be named by more than one `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` edge pointing at different storeys — a malformed-but-real shape both `elementToStorey` and `containedIn()` silently resolved to a single answer, with no way for a caller to tell the containment was contested in the source file.
  
  - `SpatialHierarchy` (`@ifc-lite/data`) gains an optional `ambiguousStorey: Set<number>` field: the element ids whose direct storey containment named more than one distinct storey. `SpatialHierarchyBuilder.build()` / `buildFromCache()` (`@ifc-lite/parser`) always populate it (empty when nothing was ambiguous); it also round-trips through the parser worker transport.
  - `EntityNode.containedInAmbiguous()` (`@ifc-lite/query`) answers the same question per-call, for callers using `containedIn()` instead of the parser's aggregate hierarchy.
  
  Neither `elementToStorey`'s nor `containedIn()`'s existing resolution changes — both still return a single winner. Detection reuses the direct-containment lists (`byStorey` / inverse `ContainsElements` edges) each already builds, so it costs no extra graph traversal.

- [#4250](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4250) [`cabfd37`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/cabfd3752d8dc221042990187669a5670be88df8) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Added `matches` (regex) to the shared property/quantity comparison operator ([#4094](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4094), follow-up to [#4091](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4091)). This is one of the three prerequisites [#4094](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4094) names for honouring `/regex/` selector text end to end (GlobalId and `+` group support remain open); it now works everywhere `compareFilterValue` already backs `bim.query().where(...)` -- the CLI `HeadlessBackend`, the MCP backend, and the viewer's SDK adapter -- with no further plumbing, since all three already delegated to it.
  
  `expected` is a bare regex source with no `/.../ ` delimiters (the same shape `parseSelector`'s regex literal already carries), tested against `String(actual)`. It is case-sensitive and does not boolean-normalize its operands (unlike every other operator here).
  
  `expected` is caller-supplied and, via the MCP `query_entities` tool, can be agent/LLM-influenced -- `new RegExp(source).test(actual)` is not safe to run on untrusted input: a pattern like `^(a+)+$` is exponential in subject length in V8's backtracking engine (measured: a 35-character non-matching subject already exceeded 30s on a single synchronous call, which on the MCP server blocks every connected client, not just the offending query). Before compiling, a pattern is now rejected -- loudly, by throwing, not by silently returning `false` -- if it is over 200 characters, or if it contains a quantified group with another quantifier inside it (e.g. `(a+)+`), the shape this was measured against. This is a heuristic input constraint, not a proof of linear-time execution: it will reject some patterns that would in fact run fine, and it will not catch every ReDoS-capable shape (e.g. overlapping alternation like `(a|a)*`). A linear-time engine (e.g. RE2) was ruled out -- this environment cannot add a new dependency; a true wall-clock timeout was ruled out too -- `.test()` cannot be interrupted synchronously, and moving the match off the main thread is a much larger, separate change. Residual ReDoS risk from a pattern shape the heuristic does not recognise remains.
  
  A rejected or syntactically-invalid pattern now throws rather than returning `false` -- fixing an inconsistency with this repo's existing fail-loud precedent for caller-supplied input (`--limit`/`--offset` validate up front with `fatal()`). A pattern is also now compiled once and cached by its source string, rather than recompiled for every candidate entity a `where`/`--where` query evaluates.
  
  Reachable from:
  - `bim.query().where(pset, prop, 'matches', pattern)` (SDK, and every backend built on it).
  - The MCP `query_entities` tool's `property.op`.
  - `ifc-lite query --where "Pset.Prop~=pattern"` and `ifc-lite export --where "Pset.Prop~=pattern"` (new `~=` token; plain `~` still means `contains`).
  
  Not included here: `ifc-lite mutate --where` has its own separate, non-delegating comparator (`matchesFilter` in `mutate.ts`) and was left untouched; the CLI `--select`/selector flag, the MCP `selector` parameter, `bim.query().select()`, and the viewer's remaining unsupported selector constructs (`parent=`, `query:`, `+` group unions, material `Category`, GlobalId as a comparison, quantity rows through a property term) are all still open, tracked on [#4094](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4094).

It reads the whole grammar — class and GlobalId terms with `!` subtraction, attribute and `Pset.Prop` comparisons over `= != > >= < <= *= !*=`, `type=` / `material=` / `classification=` / `location=` / `parent=` keywords, `query:` key paths, quoted values, `/regex/` literals and `+` unions — and answers with either an AST or an error carrying the character offset that broke. Accepting more than any one surface can evaluate is deliberate: an adapter names what it dropped instead of matching nothing in silence.

### Minor Changes

- [#3468](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3468) [`586fa29`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/586fa292b69cdb3ba6e45764b4ff742b2fa7b9a9) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix queries, filters, and CSV/JSON exports that silently dropped or omitted data when an entity carried two property (or quantity) sets with the same name -- e.g. one from the type definition and one from the occurrence, which is valid IFC.
  
  Affected symptoms, now fixed:
  - MCP and CLI entity queries with a property filter (`query_entities`, `ifc-lite query --where`) could wrongly exclude a matching entity from the results, with no indication anything was omitted, when the filtered property lived ONLY on the entity's second same-named property set. (When both sets carry it, the filter still reads the first one's value -- see the closing paragraph.)
  - CSV/JSON export with a `Pset.Property` or `Qto.Quantity` column could emit an empty cell instead of the real value, for the same reason.
  - The viewer's advanced-filter query could likewise drop a matching entity from the result count/highlight.
  - `ifc-lite query`'s `--sort`, `--group-by` and `--unique` on a `Pset.Property` path, and `ifc-lite export`'s dotted columns, read only the first same-named set and so sorted, grouped, or exported a blank where a value existed.
  - Editing a quantity whose base value lived on a second same-named quantity set recorded the wrong "old value" and the wrong create-vs-update classification, which undo relied on.
  - Deleting a property or quantity set that the entity carried twice under the same name removed only the first one's members: the panel showed the whole set gone while the exported file still carried the second one's properties.
  
  All of these now scan every same-named set, not just the first, before deciding a property or quantity is absent.
  
  Which member they then use is still first-match, and that is the remaining gap: when two same-named sets both carry the property, only the first one's value is read. Emitting one cell wants exactly that, but a filter does not -- `ifc-lite query --where Pset_WallCommon.FireRating=REI60` still drops a wall whose first `Pset_WallCommon` says `REI30` and whose second says `REI60`. That behaviour predates this change and is tracked in [#3490](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3490).

- [#3577](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3577) [`2c84b15`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/2c84b15526456ad57ba93a77f669208174efbed3) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Add `compareFilterValue`/`normalizeBooleanValue`/`findAllPropertiesInSets` (and the `FilterComparisonOp` type), the shared implementation of the `QueryDescriptor.filters` comparison the CLI (`HeadlessBackend`), MCP, and `ifc-lite query --where` backends each carried a private copy of. The viewer's embedded SDK backend — the one behind `bim.query().where(...)` in sandbox/playground scripts, the SDK's primary consumption path — never picked up the boolean-normalization or case-insensitive-`contains` fix the other backends have independently landed, so an identical `where()` call could silently match a different result set depending on which host ran the script. That backend now uses this shared function, and the CLI/MCP backends were switched to it too so the four implementations can't drift apart again.
  
  Public `where()`/`--where` behaviour is unchanged by this unification:
  - `exists` still matches as soon as the property/quantity is found, regardless of its value — an `IFCPROPERTYSINGLEVALUE('FireRating',$,$,$)` (a `$` nominal value, parsed as `null`) is present in its pset and must match `exists`, the same as before this refactor.
  - A `where()` filter on any operator still matches when ANY same-named property set carries a satisfying value, not just the first one found ([#3490](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3490)) — an entity can legitimately carry two same-named psets (e.g. type + occurrence).

- [#3541](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3541) [`cfee9b2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/cfee9b28f5e6bec2040a29cbf7917be4696f407e) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `query --where` (and `query_entities`'s `property` filter over MCP) tested only the first same-named property or quantity set, so an entity was wrongly excluded when the value it should have matched lived on a later same-named set ([#3490](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3490)) — two `IfcPropertySet`/`IfcElementQuantity` entities sharing one name is legitimate (e.g. one from the type definition, one from the occurrence).
  
  A filter is a predicate over the entity, so it now passes when ANY same-named set satisfies the operator, not just the first one found — uniformly across every operator, `!=` included. `@ifc-lite/query` adds `findAllPropertiesInSets`/`findAllQuantitiesInSets` (alongside the existing first-match `findPropertyInSets`/`findQuantityInSets`, which stay correct for value extraction — export, aggregation, display); `@ifc-lite/cli`'s `query --where` and the shared `HeadlessBackend.query.entities()` filter, and `@ifc-lite/mcp`'s `query_entities` filter, all switch to the any-match lookup. The viewer SDK's `entities()` filter now matches a property/quantity in ANY same-named set, not only the first.

### Patch Changes

- [#3465](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3465) [`10b45b5`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/10b45b571e2c2832bd938bb2a89e6d85d80aed5d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `EntityNode.property()` and `EntityNode.quantity()` dropped a property or quantity that lived only on the second of two same-named sets on an entity, returning `null` instead.
  
  Two distinct `IfcPropertySet` (or `IfcElementQuantity`) entities sharing the same `Name` is a legitimate model shape — two separate `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` relationships pointing at two different sets that happen to be named alike. The on-demand extraction path used for a raw STEP parse returns one array entry per underlying set rather than merging same-named ones (unlike the columnar `PropertyTable`'s `getForEntity`, which does merge them), so `store.getProperties()`/`store.getQuantities()` can legitimately return two entries with the same `name`.
  
  `property()` and `quantity()` both used `.find(p => p.name === setName)`, which stops at the first same-named set. If that particular set instance lacked the requested property/quantity, the method returned `null` even though a later set with the same name carried it — the same defect fixed in `PropertyTable.getProperty` ([#2907](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2907)), left unfixed in `EntityNode`'s own read path. Both methods now check every same-named set before giving up.

- [#3463](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3463) [`9368b2d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9368b2dcdc8df61afe790e671de95317e0418c21) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `PropertyTable.getProperties` (and `QueryInterface.getProperties`, which calls through it) silently dropping a property set when an entity carries two `IfcPropertySet`s that share the same name.
  
  An entity can legitimately carry two same-named property sets — two `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` pointing at distinct `IfcPropertySet`s. `getProperty` already scans every same-named set for this exact shape ([#2907](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2907)). `getProperties` did not: it keyed its result by pset name alone, so the second same-named set silently overwrote the first in the returned `Map`, and every property that lived only in the overwritten set vanished with no signal that anything went missing.
  
  Same-named sets are now merged into one entry per name, with the earlier set's values winning on a key collision — matching `getProperty`'s own first-match-wins order.

- [#3782](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3782) [`a1069f8`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a1069f8f096fcfc5771200a2748466096c3463d5) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `RelationshipGraphBuilder.addEdge` double-counting a relationship that a file declares twice.
  
  Nothing in EXPRESS forbids two `IfcRel*` instances from naming the same (relating, related) pair — two `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` records can re-relate the same element to the same storey, and `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` carries only a `NoRelatedTypeObject` WHERE rule. The builder pushed both edges, so every consumer that walks the raw edge list saw the target twice: `store.spatialHierarchy.byStorey` listed the element twice, the viewer's generated schedule reported one product too many, and `SpatialHierarchy.parquet` emitted a duplicate row (which a `GROUP BY` in an external BI tool inherits).
  
  `addEdge` now folds a repeat of a `(source, target, type)` triple into the surviving edge instead of dropping it: the first instance's express id becomes `relationshipId`, later repeats are kept on `shadowedRelationshipIds`. Edges that differ in source, target, or type are untouched. The parser's on-demand property/quantity/classification/document maps — which a query reads in preference to the graph — now dedup the same way, so a redundant `IfcRel*` no longer duplicates a pset, qset, classification, or document either. `onDemandMaterialMap` is deliberately left as-is: `buildMaterialUsageIndex` already dedupes per (material, entity) downstream via its own `seenPerMaterial` set, a contract pinned by `material-fraction-and-associations.test.ts` (`onDemandMaterialMap.get(100)` for two redundant `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial` records is expected to equal `[300, 300, 999]`, not `[300, 999]`) — deduping upstream too would duplicate that work, not fix a gap.
  
  `shadowedRelationshipIds` is stored on the wire as three small, Transferable typed arrays (`shadowedEdgeIndex`/`shadowedGroupOffsets`/`shadowedRelIds`) rather than one slot per edge, because the obvious dense shape structured-clones (instead of transferring) across the parser worker boundary — measured +1.2s / +190MB on a 12M-edge model for a field that's empty on almost every edge. The fields are optional on `RelationshipEdges`/`RelationshipEdgesColumns`: absent entirely on a graph that tracks no duplicates, read via `?.`.
  
  Four places needed the extra ids, not just the deduped edge itself:
  - `related()` in both the CLI and MCP backends now treats a connection as alive as long as any one of `relationshipId` or `shadowedRelationshipIds` still exists (via a shared `edgeSurvives` helper), so deleting the surviving `IfcRel*` doesn't erase a connection a sibling instance still names.
  - `getRelationshipsBetween` reports `shadowedRelationshipIds` on each `RelationshipInfo`.
  - `Relationships.parquet` and the DuckDB `relationships` table (via a shared `flattenRelationshipEdges` helper) and the anonymized-subset exporter's `collectRelatedEntities` all emit one row/closure entry per shadowed id too, not just the survivor — each is a real STEP record in the source file.
  - The on-disk model cache (`@ifc-lite/cache`, FORMAT_VERSION 17 -> 18) persists the shadowed-id columns, so a model reloaded from cache gets the same delete-then-query behavior as a fresh parse. A v17 cache entry (written before this change) is read as having no shadowed ids rather than being treated as corrupt — matches the pre-fix in-memory behaviour exactly, since those graphs never tracked them either — and the cache lookup key already embeds `FORMAT_VERSION`, so an old entry simply misses and re-parses on next load.
  
  `Relationships.parquet` also drops a row whose own `IfcRel*` record has been deleted through the overlay, not only rows whose source or target endpoint was — an `IfcRel*` line is a row in `Entities.parquet` too, so a `RelId` for a deleted one was a dangling reference. Because each shadowed id is its own row, a deleted survivor drops while a live sibling keeps the connection, matching `edgeSurvives`.
  
  One consequence to note: `Relationships.parquet` is still built from the deduped graph, so a redundant second `IfcRel*` instance appears as its own row again (via `shadowedRelationshipIds`) rather than being silently dropped — every `IfcRel*` record that backs a surviving edge appears at least once, including deduplicated duplicates. (Not a 1:1 row-to-record count: a deleted endpoint still drops rows, and one `IfcRel*` with N `RelatedObjects` has always produced N rows, one per target — unchanged by this fix.)

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#3009](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3009) [`131e3dc`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/131e3dc84244d9dd24859a5923ef0aef4d6119c4) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - **Breaking:** `IfcQuery.ofType()` now throws for a type string that is not an IFC entity name, instead of silently querying the `Unknown` bucket.
  
  `ofType()` maps each type string through `IfcTypeEnumFromString`, which falls back to `IfcTypeEnum.Unknown` for any name it does not recognize. A typo — `ofType('IfcWal')` — therefore returned every entity whose type the store could not classify: neither the caller's walls nor an empty result, but some other, unrelated set of entities. `ofType()` now rejects such a string with an error naming it.
  
  What still works unchanged:
  
  - **Standard IFC types that this build's enum table does not map.** `TYPE_STRING_TO_ENUM` (`@ifc-lite/data`) is a curated subset of IFC, so standard buildingSMART types such as `IfcChiller`, `IfcActuator`, `IfcElectricAppliance` — and IFC2X3's `IfcDoorStyle`, `IfcWindowStyle` and `IfcElectricalDistributionPoint` — resolve to `Unknown`. These are **not** rejected: they keep falling through to the `Unknown` bucket exactly as before, which is the only representation this build has for them and which answers the query correctly in a file whose unclassified entities are of that type.
  
    The oracle deciding this is `isKnownType()` (`@ifc-lite/parser`), the predicate that already guards `@ifc-lite/sdk`'s `addEntity`: the bundled **IFC2X3 + IFC4 + IFC4X3** schema union, minus EXPRESS defined types (`IfcLengthMeasure`, `IfcArcIndex`), with the IFC4_ADD2_TC1 codegen pin as a fallback, plus the parser's alias table for IFC2X3 leaves the bundled EXPRESS exports omit. Reusing it rather than adding a second name table keeps one source of truth for "is this a real IFC class". The suite asserts the coverage exhaustively — every entity in `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` and in all three per-version tables must pass `ofType()` — rather than by sampling names.
  - **The `Unknown` bucket itself**, still reachable by passing the literal string `'Unknown'`.
  
  Surrounding whitespace is trimmed once, and the trimmed name feeds both the enum lookup and the acceptance check. `IfcTypeEnumFromString` only uppercases, so before this a padded `ofType(' IfcWall ')` missed the enum table and resolved to `Unknown` while the check — which did trim — found `IfcWall` known and let it through: the query then ran against the `Unknown` bucket and returned entities that are not walls, with no error. For a name with no surrounding whitespace the trim is the identity, so nothing that resolved correctly before resolves differently now.
  
  What breaks: a call passing a name that is not an IFC entity name in any of those schemas — a typo, or a genuine vendor-specific type name — previously returned an `EntityQuery` over the `Unknown` bucket and now throws. Callers relying on a vendor-specific name to reach unclassified entities must pass `'Unknown'` instead. Hence the major bump: this is a behaviour change on a published SDK export, not a bug fix that is invisible to correct callers.
  
  The error text says which schemas were searched rather than assuming a misspelling, because a rejected name may well be spelled correctly:
  
  > `ofType(): "IfcWal" is not an entity name in any IFC schema this build reads (IFC2X3, IFC4, IFC4X3). Check the spelling; for a vendor-specific type name, pass 'Unknown' to query entities whose type could not be classified.`

### Minor Changes

- [#3034](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3034) [`75867a7`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/75867a7e6ebf51b2da47cab14242bcd71787ba3b) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Stop dropping entities from an unfiltered query, and stop reporting their class as `Unknown`, when the curated `IfcTypeEnum` does not carry it.
  
  **`isProductType` now keys on the inheritance chain.** It gated on `IfcTypeEnumFromString(type) !== Unknown`, and `TYPE_STRING_TO_ENUM` is a curated 138-entry subset — the same table PR [#3009](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3009) found rejecting standard buildingSMART classes. An unfiltered `bim.query()` walks `store.entityIndex.byType` and keeps only entries this predicate accepts, so every class outside those 138 was absent from the result with nothing to say so. On a 176k-entity MEP model that was every `IfcAirTerminal` (139), every `IfcDuctFitting` (383) and every `IfcDistributionPort` (2,053): 2,575 real elements, reported as not present rather than as unclassified.
  
  The gate is now `isQueryableObjectType` in `@ifc-lite/parser`: `getInheritanceChain(type).includes('IfcObjectDefinition')`, minus `IfcTypeObject` descendants. It lives in the parser rather than in each backend because `isProductType` was a verbatim copy in `packages/cli` and `packages/mcp` and only the CLI copy had tests — a predicate that had just diverged once should not be left in two places to diverge again. Both backends now alias the single implementation and keep publishing it under the old name. That is the exact line the four prefix tests were approximating: `IfcObjectDefinition` covers products, type objects, groups, systems and `IfcContext`, and excludes the other two `IfcRoot` branches, `IfcPropertyDefinition` and `IfcRelationship`. The chain resolves across the bundled schema union, so it answers for classes the pin omits. `IFC_ENTITY_NAMES` alone would not work here: it carries all ~880 classes, so keying on "is a known IFC name" floods the same query with that model's 42,024 `IfcCartesianPoint`.
  
  The MCP `dataQuality` audit counts the same set, so its score moves for an unchanged file: ports, groups, systems and annotations now enter the naming denominator that the 138-entry table kept out, and most of them are unnamed.
  
  **Behaviour change worth planning for:** on that model an unfiltered `bim.query()` returns 3,090 entities where it returned 515. The growth is real elements that were missing, and it is dominated by ports on MEP models. Callers that want the narrower set should filter with `byType`.
  
  **`EntityNode.type` no longer answers `Unknown` for an entity the product table does not index.** `store.entities` indexes products, so `getTypeName` has no row for `IfcPropertySet`, `IfcElementQuantity`, `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` or `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial` and answered `'Unknown'` for all four, while `entityIndex.byId` carried the class the whole time as the raw uppercase STEP token. `type` is what callers key passes on, so iterating a model's classes by it skipped 8,928 entities on that same model. It now falls back to the index and canonicalises through `normalizeIfcTypeName`, which resolves against the bundled schema union. `IFC_ENTITY_NAMES` would have been the same curated-subset trap one file over: it is ~880 hand-maintained entries whose generator script no longer exists, so an `IfcMove` on an IFC2X3 model came back as the raw `IFCMOVE` token — a second wrong answer.
  
  `QueryResultEntity.type`, which is what `EntityQuery.execute()` returns, carried the identical getter and is fixed with it. Both now call one `resolveEntityTypeName`; fixing only `EntityNode` would have left the two disagreeing on the same entity.
  
  Verified against the real columnar parser, not only against the query package's mock store. With both changes reverted, 3 of the 5 new CLI tests fail and 1 of the 4 new query tests fails; the two CLI tests that still pass are the ones asserting what stays excluded.

### Patch Changes

- [#2861](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2861) [`2156528`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/2156528c926114233c79ba74925c0c8656f1ea65) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `ifc-lite query`'s DuckDB SQL integration reading a NULL string-typed property as an empty string instead of SQL `NULL`.
  
  `createPropertiesTable` (duckdb-integration.ts) resolved `PropertyTable.valueString` with `valueStringIdx >= 0 ? ... : ''`. `valueString` is a `Uint32Array`, so the NULL sentinel written by `StringTable.intern(null)` (-1) wraps to 4294967295 rather than going negative — the `>= 0` check was always true and never caught it, and the row was inserted with `value_string = ''`, indistinguishable from a genuine empty-string property. `WHERE value_string IS NULL` silently matched nothing.
  
  Two siblings on the same column family already guard this correctly: `getPropertyValue`'s String branch in `@ifc-lite/data`'s `property-table.ts` and its cache-restored twin in `@ifc-lite/cache`'s `properties.ts`, both checking `idx < strings.count`. This DuckDB path is named as a sibling in `property-table.ts`'s own doc comment ("the on-demand fallback in `@ifc-lite/query`") but used an independent, unguarded decode. The fix extracts the shared logic into `resolveDuckDBStringLiteral` and applies the same in-range check, emitting the bare `NULL` keyword — matching how this same file already handles the `containedInStorey`/`definedByType` sentinels a few lines above.

- [#2907](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2907) [`b7d2a11`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b7d2a11345add8acdf0926ade5d4c1ca19ccecf7) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `PropertyTable.getProperty` returning null when an entity carries two property sets with the same name and the property lives only on the second one.
  
  `getProperty` stopped scanning at the first pset whose name matched, and returned whatever that pset had for the property (`null` if it lacked it) instead of continuing to the next same-named pset. `findEntities`, right below it in the same class, already handled two same-named psets correctly by scanning all of them; `getProperty` now does the same — it keeps checking subsequent same-named sets until it finds the property, matching the semantics IFC's `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` allows (an entity can be targeted by more than one property set sharing a name).

### Patch Changes

- [#2218](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2218) [`d260a35`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d260a35669e379e5f465861294391c95ee48cb3d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix three `EntityNode` relationship helpers that traversed the graph in the wrong direction.

  The parser builds every edge as `addEdge(relatingObject, relatedObject)` (`columnar-parser.ts:476`), so `forward` always means relating → related. Three helpers were oriented against that:

  - `filledBy()` used `inverse`. `IfcRelFillsElement` is `(RelatingOpeningElement, RelatedBuildingElement)`, so the opening is the source and the filler the target — reaching the filler from the opening is a forward traversal. As written the method returned an empty array for every opening, which is indistinguishable from "this opening has no filler".
  - `definingType()` used `forward` and `instances()` used `inverse`. `IfcRelDefinesByType` has the type as its relating object, so the type is the source and each occurrence the target; both helpers were the wrong way round. The element → type lookups in `on-demand-extractors.ts` already used `inverse` for this, so the two disagreed.

  `filledBy()` is the one with an observable consequence today: `@ifc-lite/clash` calls `opening.filledBy()` to exclude a host element from clashing with the door or window filling its own opening (`adapters/step.ts:172`). Because the call always returned nothing, that exclusion never fired and every door and window could report a false-positive clash against the opening it legitimately fills. `definingType()` and `instances()` have no in-repo callers, so their fix is latent — but they are public API.

  The gap survived because the unit-test fixture encoded the reverse orientation for `IfcRelDefinesByType`, so the mock and the reversed code agreed with each other. The fixture is corrected to match the parser, and `IfcRelFillsElement` — previously absent from it entirely — is now covered.

- [#2321](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2321) [`51ec81b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/51ec81b125532cd0efe4f004c7ab01f4efe55cb8) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `EntityQuery.first()` permanently capping the query it was called on. `first()` narrowed the result set by calling `this.limit(1)` — which mutates the query object itself rather than a clone — so the cap outlived the call: every subsequent `execute()`, `ids()` or `first()` on the same query returned at most one row. A caller's own explicit `limit(n)` was overwritten too, silently collapsing to 1.

  Building a query, peeking at the first match, then iterating it in full is ordinary usage of a fluent query API, and `EntityQuery` is published surface — so "no in-repo caller does that" is not a defence here, the same reasoning applied to `ParquetExporter`'s un-memoised overlay index in the [#2111](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2111) review.

  `first()` now narrows for the duration of the call only, restoring whatever limit was previously set rather than clearing it.

### Patch Changes

- [#1935](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1935) [`9a7b5a2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9a7b5a2fc1bb85ce60e954ccf7819829e43431d6) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - fix(query): make `whereProperty` actually filter STEP-parsed models

  `EntityQuery.whereProperty()` returned `[]` for every `.ifc` (STEP) model, for
  any property-set name, silently — no error, no warning. `applyPropertyFilters`
  only consulted `store.properties.findByProperty`, but a STEP parse deliberately
  leaves the columnar property/quantity tables empty and routes reads through the
  on-demand maps (issue [#577](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/577)), so that lookup could only ever return nothing. The
  read path (`EntityNode.property`, `QueryResultEntity.getProperty`) resolved the
  same data correctly, so a model that plainly carried the property still filtered
  to nothing. [#577](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/577) / [#578](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/578) fixed this class on the read path and left the filter
  path behind; this is that other half.

  `whereProperty` now picks a strategy per store. When the property table reports
  an explicit zero row count it resolves the surviving candidates through
  `store.getProperties` / `store.getQuantities`, the same accessors the read path
  uses; otherwise it answers off the table's name indices as before. Only an
  explicit zero selects the fallback — a duck-typed store whose table omits the
  optional `count` keeps the indexed path, because every store written before
  `count` existed implements `findByProperty` for real. The fallback is
  candidate-scoped, and each entity is resolved at most once _per source_ across
  all filters: property sets and quantity sets have separate caches, so an entity
  reached by both sides costs one `getProperties` and one `getQuantities`, never
  one per filter.
  Nothing is materialised onto `store.properties`, so IDS keeps reading the richer
  on-demand property shape.

  Quantity sets are folded into the same call on every store, making the
  documented `whereProperty('Qto_WallBaseQuantities', 'NetSideArea', '>', 10)`
  form work; previously a `Qto_` filter matched nothing on any path.

  Matching is ANY-match: an entity passes when any property of that name, in any
  set of that name, satisfies the operator. That is what
  `PropertyTable.findByProperty` already did, so the two strategies agree with
  each other. It deliberately differs from the single-value read path, which
  returns the first match — the two disagree only for an entity carrying the same
  property twice, and that divergence is pinned by a test.

  `@ifc-lite/data` gains two additive optional interface members and one new
  export: `QuantityTable.findByQuantity` (the quantity mirror of `findByProperty`,
  answered off the quantity-name index), `count` on `IfcStoreBase`'s property and
  quantity tables, and `comparePropertyValues` — the definition of property-filter
  comparison semantics shared by the store-level property tables (same-type only,
  `null` never matches, `==` aliases `=`). `@ifc-lite/cache` and the viewer's
  server-converted store now use
  `comparePropertyValues` instead of local copies: the cache copy had no boolean
  branch, so a cache-restored `findByProperty('IsExternal', '=', true)` silently
  returned `[]`, and the server copy ignored the operator entirely and compared
  with `===`, so `'>' 60` answered `= 60`.

  **Cost.** Filtering a STEP model is now real work where it used to be an instant
  wrong answer. The shape of that work: the filter resolves property sets **per
  candidate**, so cost is proportional to how many entities reach the filter, not
  to how many carry the property. Scope with `ofType(...)` / `onStorey(...)` before
  `whereProperty(...)` — an unscoped `query.all().whereProperty(...)` resolves
  every entity in the model. The guide and the package README now say so.

  This per-candidate path covers more than a fresh `.ifc` parse. A cache written
  from a STEP parse serialises the empty property table verbatim, so a
  cache-restored `.ifc` model reports `count === 0` and takes the same fallback;
  the viewer's server-converted store reports `count: 0` too. What decides the
  path is the store rather than the file format: a store carrying table rows is
  answered from the index, and one reporting no rows resolves per candidate.

  Those indexed stores are deliberately kept off the per-candidate path: folding
  quantities by resolving every candidate would have made a `Qto_` filter cost
  them per candidate as well, so the quantity side goes through the new
  `findByQuantity` name index instead. Where an indexed store's cost moves at all
  it is because the query is answered rather than silently returning nothing — a
  `Qto_` filter that used to match zero entities now matches the real set.

  `EntityQuery.whereProperty(psetName, propName, ...)` recorded the property-set
  name but never passed it to `findByProperty`, so a property matched in _any_
  property set — e.g. filtering `Pset_WallCommon.IsExternal` also returned doors
  whose `Pset_DoorCommon.IsExternal` matched. `findByProperty` gains an optional
  `psetName` argument (honored by the in-memory, cache-restored, and
  server-converted property tables), and `whereProperty` now passes it. An unknown
  pset name matches nothing.

### Patch Changes

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

  `parseColumnar` intentionally leaves the pre-parsed `store.properties` / `store.quantities` tables empty and populates `onDemandPropertyMap` / `onDemandQuantityMap` instead, but `QueryResultEntity` only read from the empty pre-parsed tables. As a result `query.ofType(...).includeProperties().includeQuantities().execute()` always returned elements with empty `properties` / `quantities`, even when the IFC file contained them (issue #577).

  `loadPropertiesFromStore` / `loadQuantitiesFromStore` in `query-result-entity.ts` now fall back to `extractPropertiesOnDemand` / `extractQuantitiesOnDemand` when the pre-parsed tables are empty and the on-demand maps are present. This applies to the `properties` / `quantities` getters, the `loadProperties` / `loadQuantities` eager loaders, and the `getProperty()` accessor.

  Also normalizes untagged STEP enumeration tokens (`.T.` / `.F.` / `.U.` / `.X.`) emitted by some authoring tools in the `NominalValue` slot of `IfcPropertySingleValue`: `.T.` / `.F.` now decode to real JS booleans and `.U.` / `.X.` to a Logical `null`, matching the behavior of the conformant `IFCBOOLEAN(...)` / `IFCLOGICAL(...)` typed form.
