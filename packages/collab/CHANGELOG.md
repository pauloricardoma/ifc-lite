### Minor Changes

- [#3090](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3090) [`228bbe7`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/228bbe730522148ea797780c5acd08502b18a3a3) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `mergeBranch(parent, branch, 'layer')` silently dropping every edit the branch made to an entity that already existed in the parent.
  
  The `'layer'` strategy snapshotted the branch as IFCX and fed the result to
  `seedFromIfcx`. That seeder routes every node through `createEntity`, which
  is a deliberate no-op on a path the doc already holds — right for seeding a
  doc from a snapshot, wrong for merging. Since a branch forks from its
  parent, essentially every entity the branch *modified* was already present
  in the merge target, so the merge landed only the branch's brand-new
  entities and discarded all of the modifications: attributes, children,
  inherits, psets, quantities, classifications, materials and geometry refs
  alike.
  
  A new `applyIfcxOverlay(doc, file)` applies an IFCX file as a layer of
  opinions rather than as a seed, and `mergeBranch('layer')` now uses it. It
  creates entities the doc lacks exactly as the seeder does; for entities
  already present it writes the file's opinions on top — values overwrite,
  `null` removes a flat attribute, child or inherit, an `ifclite::deleted:
  true` node deletes — and leaves untouched anything the file says nothing
  about.
  
  Read that last clause narrowly. `mergeBranch('layer')` sends a FULL snapshot,
  so the file has an opinion on nearly everything: a value the parent changed
  after the fork is overwritten by the branch's fork-time value even when the
  branch never edited it. This is the trade the release makes: previously a
  layer merge dropped the branch's edits, now it applies them, and the price is
  that the branch's fork-time value can win over a newer parent one. Attributes
  and geometry behave the same way here; geometry is not a special case.
  
  One consequence is specific to geometry. Blob GC derives the set it RETAINS
  from the live doc and sweeps the complement, so reverting a `blobHash` flips
  which blob counts as an orphan; a sweep between the parent's re-mesh and the
  merge can leave the restored reference pointing at a blob that has been
  deleted.
  
  Geometry records go through `upsertGeometry` rather than `createGeometry`,
  which returns an existing record untouched. Without that, a branch that
  re-meshed geometry the parent already had merged "successfully" and left the
  parent on the old blob hash.
  
  `seedFromIfcx` is unchanged in both its behaviour and its options: it stays
  additive and idempotent, because `apps/viewer` and `snapshot/worker.ts` use
  it to seed live session docs, where overlaying a snapshot onto live edits
  would be the worse bug on the more common path.
  
  One limit is worth stating plainly, since it is a property of the wire
  format and not of this fix: a full IFCX snapshot emits only what an entity
  *has*, so an entity or attribute the branch deleted is simply absent rather
  than nulled or tombstoned. `mergeBranch('layer')` therefore still does not
  propagate deletions made on the branch. `applyIfcxOverlay` does honour
  deletions when a layer states them explicitly.
  
  A second limit, this one in the code: a nulled pset or quantity property is
  NOT removed. `extractMinimalLayer` flattens those into
  `bsi::ifc::v5a::<Set>::<Prop>` attribute keys, so the removal arrives as an
  attribute null and is looked for in the flat attribute map, where it never
  was. The property survives and the call returns normally. Only flat
  attributes, children and inherits are removed today.

- [#3092](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3092) [`e6caf11`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e6caf11a8f8d9d8634a6811b6705ab3367cd02e0) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Stop a collab snapshot round trip from inventing per-entity provenance, and carry the real thing on the wire.
  
  `snapshotToIfcx` wrote nothing about who created an entity or when, because
  IFCX nodes had no provenance slot. `seedFromIfcx` then filled both fields in
  from the file header — which names whoever serialized the *file*, not
  whoever authored each entity, and for a snapshot of a collab doc that is the
  snapshotter plus the write clock. An entity carrying `createdBy: 'ada'` /
  `createdAt: '2019-05-05'` came back claiming a different author and a
  different date, in a shape indistinguishable from genuine attribution. A
  missing field reads as "unknown"; a fabricated one gets trusted.
  
  Two changes:
  
  - **A wire carrier.** `ifclite::meta` (new member of `IFCLITE_ATTR`, the
    extension namespace that already carries collab's classifications,
    materials and geometry refs) holds `createdBy`, `createdAt`,
    `lastEditedBy`, `lastEditedAt` and `previousPath`, so real provenance
    survives snapshot → seed. Values are shape-gated on the way in: only
    strings are read, and a foreign value under the key stays an ordinary
    flat attribute. Every field carried is written once at entity creation
    and never re-stamped — a per-edit stamp would put this attribute in
    every minimal layer and give the merge engine a component that conflicts
    on every concurrent edit.
  - **No more header defaults.** `seedFromIfcx` and `seedFromStep` no longer
    copy `header.author` / `header.timestamp` onto every entity, and no longer
    stamp the read clock as `createdAt`. What the wire does not say now stays
    unset. The file-level record is still available as `meta.header` /
    `meta.stepHeader`.
  
  `createEntity` also now writes the `bsi::ifc::class` attribute when given an
  `ifcClass`. `meta.ifcClass` is doc-local bookkeeping with no wire form, so
  an entity whose class was only ever passed as that option snapshotted
  without a class and came back classless; the MCP draft path had already
  open-coded the attribute at its own call site to work around this.
  
  Scope: `lastEditedBy` / `lastEditedAt` survive only because nothing
  re-stamps them today. Relationships (the doc's separate `relationships`
  map) still do not survive a snapshot — IFCX has no relationship node and
  no first-party writer populates that map; `snapshot-relationships.test.ts`
  pins that as a tripwire rather than papering over it.

### Patch Changes

- [#3022](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3022) [`66697fc`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/66697fc57de1de4475a2c5eed4361e0e378e0f7a) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `sweepBlobs` reporting a blob as reclaimed even when the underlying `store.delete()` call failed.
  
  `sweepBlobs` computed how many deletes actually succeeded but then discarded that count and returned `decision.reclaimBytes` unconditionally — the full byte total `planBlobSweep` had planned to free, regardless of whether any individual `delete()` call reported failure (a remote backend 404, a race with another sweep, a transient error). A caller using the return value for storage-capacity accounting would believe more space was freed than actually was, while the undeleted blob kept consuming storage. `planBlobSweep` now records each dropped hash's byte length on the `SweepDecision`, and `sweepBlobs` sums only the bytes for hashes whose `delete()` actually returned `true`.

- [#3004](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3004) [`2580830`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/25808308bbbc63eb0fd8b25e6dd0c08864adb6a8) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `snapshotToIfcx` writing a literal `null` for a flat attribute value that its own counterpart, `seedFromIfcx`, treats as an IFCX removal opinion and silently drops.
  
  A doc attribute can legitimately hold `null` (e.g. a user clearing a root
  attribute like `Description` through the viewer's mutation bridge). Before
  this fix, `snapshotToIfcx` serialized that value verbatim, so a
  snapshot -> seed -> snapshot cycle was not idempotent: the first snapshot
  carried `"Description": null`, the intervening seed dropped the key per
  `from-ifcx.ts`'s documented contract, and the second snapshot of the
  re-seeded doc omitted the key entirely - two snapshots of "the same" doc
  state disagreeing with each other.
  
  `snapshotToIfcx` now drops null-valued attributes on the way out, matching
  the reader's contract instead of handing it a value it is guaranteed to
  discard on the next round-trip.

### Minor Changes

- [#2801](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2801) [`b14e710`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b14e710ae8d56f518f84abb4d4ec8d1f98aacad8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `BlobStore.put` now accepts an optional `AbortSignal`, and `HttpBlobStore`
  forwards it to `fetch`.
  
  A hung upload was worse than a failed one: a rejection is counted, retried and
  can trip a caller's failure ceiling, but a request that never settles produces
  no failure at all, so nothing retries, no ceiling trips, and a geometry seed
  never resolves while the UI reports work in progress. `LayeredBlobStore` also
  forwards the signal, since its `Promise.all` cannot settle while the remote half
  hangs and its `.catch` never runs when nothing rejects.
  
  Additive and optional: existing callers are unaffected, and implementations that
  cannot abort may ignore the option.

### Patch Changes

In a browser this went unnoticed because navigating away reclaims everything; in a Node test process it kept the event loop alive indefinitely — `startCollab`'s entry-race regression test, run together with its sibling collab test files in one process, would pass every assertion and then never let the process exit.

### Patch Changes

- [#2336](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2336) [`a220406`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a2204062ba1fc555e4529896cbc82efccc7a5146) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `promoteEntityType` silently discarding data when its target path already exists. `createEntity` is documented as idempotent — a pre-existing path is a no-op that returns the existing entity unchanged — but `promoteEntityType` deletes the source path unconditionally before calling it. If the target already existed (e.g. seeded by a concurrent peer, or a prior promotion that landed on the same path), the call reported success with a truthy `Y.Map` while the source entity's carried attributes, children and meta were permanently lost and the target kept its stale data. `promoteEntityType` now throws before deleting the source when the target path is already occupied, matching this file's existing convention of throwing on precondition violations (`setAttribute`, `setChild`, etc.) instead of silently discarding data.

- [#2337](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2337) [`29409e5`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/29409e57227d3c458707dbc2cf0cb2e8ae8fcf7b) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix two gaps found while auditing files with no direct test coverage:

  - `createConflictDetector` classified concurrent writes to a Pset property as a `pset-property` conflict but had no matching case for the structurally identical Qset (quantity) shape — concurrent quantity writes from two peers landed silently with no conflict event, a false negative. `classify()` now handles `ENTITY_KEY.QUANTITIES` the same way it handles `ENTITY_KEY.PSETS`, emitting a new `quantity` `ConflictKind`.
  - `redactAuthorMeta` (the "anonymise this project" GDPR helper) blanked `createdBy`/`lastEditedBy` on every entity but never touched the `annotations` map, so a markup pin's `authorId`/`authorName` (real display name) survived redaction untouched. It now blanks both fields on every annotation alongside the existing entity-meta redaction; annotation `note` text and position are left as-is.

- [#2220](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2220) [`512406f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/512406f0d21c7e33b8c84a83865ffaff299e7cc1) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix a snapshot -> seed round trip silently dropping an explicitly-cleared `classifications` or `materials` attribute.

  `inflateStructuredAttributes` (`packages/collab/src/snapshot/structured-attrs.ts`) shape-gated these attributes with `Array.isArray(value) && value.every(isClassificationRefShaped)` (same for materials). `[].every(...)` is vacuously true, so an entity whose classifications/materials were explicitly cleared to `[]` passed the gate, got pulled out of the flat attributes into the structured branch, and `flattenStructuredBranches` only re-emits that branch when it's non-empty — so the key never came back on the next snapshot. A reader who took a snapshot after the clearing landed would see the attribute vanish entirely rather than resolve to `[]`, and could keep serving a stale non-empty value from before the clear. Both branches now require a non-empty array before taking the structured path (mirroring the existing `geometryRefs` guard), so an explicit `[]` stays in the flat attributes and survives the round trip.

The typed `TypedPropertyValue` record is the canonical wire shape: the MCP `set_property` draft op emits it, property extraction decodes it (and skips `ifclite::` carriers), composition resolves `null` attribute opinions as removals, and `bakeLayers` preserves the persistent carriers while stripping bookkeeping.

  declared `import` + `types`, so any resolver hitting the CJS/default

  ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED. The `default` entry points at the same

### Patch Changes

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

### Minor Changes

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Final integration batch. Closes the last cross-cutting items in the
  plan: the spec §16.3 mutations bridge, open problem #7 (per-section
  locks), the viewer-mount one-liner, the TLS bundle helper, and a
  runnable performance benchmark suite. **+11 tests, total 175 passing.**

  `@ifc-lite/collab`

  - **`bindMutationsToCollab(view, session, opts)`** (spec §16.3): wraps
    `@ifc-lite/mutations` `MutablePropertyView` so legacy STEP property
    edits mirror to the Y.Doc whenever a collab session is bound. The
    view's existing observers / change-set tracking still fire; reads
    pass through. `resolveEntity(id)` translates numeric expressIds to
    IFCX paths; returning `null` skips the mirror for that mutation.
    `PROPERTY_TYPE_NAMES` maps `PropertyValueType` enum values to the
    IFCX type strings stored on `PropertyValue`.
  - **`mountPresenceInViewer({ session, container, viewport })`** (spec
    §7 viewer mount): one-line glue that creates a presence overlay,
    forwards `mousemove → setCursor2d`, and returns a `teardown()`.
  - **`runPerfBenchmarks(budget?)`** (§15): self-contained Node-runnable
    benchmarks measuring single-attribute update size, cold-load time
    for a 1k-entity fixture, and (gated by `COLLAB_BENCH_HEAVY`) state-
    vector size at 100k entities. Each result reports
    `{ name, value, unit, budget, ok }`. Useful for `vitest` perf
    regression coverage and CI smoke tests.

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server`

  - **Per-section locks (open #7).** `createPathLockRegistry()` →
    `add({ prefix, label?, exemptUserIds?, exemptRoles? })` /
    `remove(lock)` / `matches(path, principal)` / `clear()`.
    `verifyAgainstPathLocks(registry)` returns a `VerifyMessageFn`
    that decodes incoming sync-update frames, runs them through a
    throwaway Y.Doc to harvest touched paths, and rejects writes that
    intersect any locked prefix (audit reason `locked:<label>`).
    `harvestUpdatePaths(update)` is exposed for tests + custom
    filtering. Path format: `entities/wall`, `geometry/g7`, etc.
  - **`startSecureCollabServer(opts)`**: bundles `createSecureHttpServer`
    - `secureHttpHandler` + `startCollabServer` so deployers get
      TLS-in-process plus the OWASP-baseline header wrapper without
      writing the wiring.

  Tests added (+11): mutations bridge happy path / null-resolve / delete
  mirror, path-lock registry add/match/remove + path harvesting + raw-WS
  rejection of writes to a locked prefix, perf benchmarks for
  single-attr-update / cold-load / runPerfBenchmarks happy paths,
  secure-bundle smoke test (rejects missing cert paths), viewer-bridge
  overlay mounting + mousemove forwarding + clean teardown via a
  hand-rolled DOM stub.

  Plan doc: v0.1 ☑ (mutations bridge added), v0.2 ☑ (mount-in-viewer
  shipped), v0.5 ☑ (TLS bundle + per-section locks). Open problems are
  closed in this batch as follows: problem #7 (per-section locks) is
  new in this PR; problems #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9, #10 were
  already closed in prior batches.

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Big reach-for-the-stars batch. Closes (or near-closes) the remaining
  substantial items in `docs/architecture/collab-plan.md` for v0.2,
  v0.5, v0.7, and v1.0. **+21 tests, total 140 passing.**

  `@ifc-lite/collab`

  - **History sidecar (v0.7).** `HistorySidecar` interface with
    `MemoryHistorySidecar` ship and an `AutomergeHistorySidecar` slot
    reserved (matching the same interface). Records, time-travels, diffs
    per-entity-id, branches, merges. `attachHistorySidecar(session,
sidecar, opts)` drives a sidecar from a live `CollabSession` on a
    configurable interval + on demand, with optional differential
    layers in each entry for cheap diff queries.
  - **End-to-end encryption (v1.0).** WebCrypto-based suite:
    `deriveRoomKey` (PBKDF2-SHA256, 200k iterations default),
    `generateRoomKey` / `exportRoomKey` / `importRoomKey`,
    `encryptFrame` / `decryptFrame` with versioned
    `[1B ver][12B IV][N B AES-GCM]` framing, and a `KeyRing`
    (`createKeyRing(initial, { gracePeriodMs })`) so in-flight frames
    decode through retired keys for the configured grace window.
  - **Presence-renderer math (v0.2).** `peerVisuals(peers, opts)` turns
    a `PresenceMap` into render-ready `{ color, label, opacity,
isStale, cursor3d, cursor2d, selection, modelId }`. Color resolution
    uses `colorForUser` against either the human or agent palette
    depending on the `(agent)` suffix; opacity fades over `staleAfterMs`.
    `cursorScreenPosition` projects 2D cursors per viewport.

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server`

  - **S3 persistence (v0.5).** `S3Persistence` against an injectable
    `S3LikeClient` + `S3Commands` shape — AWS SDK, R2, MinIO, or any
    S3-compatible client all fit without forcing
    `@ifc-lite/collab-server` to depend on `@aws-sdk/client-s3`.
    Per-room layout: `<prefix><room>.snap` for compacted state plus
    `<prefix><room>.log/<NNNNNNNNNN>.bin` for rolling log frames.
    Implements load / append / compact / drop with `frameMaxBytes`
    enforcement.
  - **Anti-replay wired into the message path (v0.5 / open #8).**
    `RoomOptions.verifyMessage: VerifyMessageFn` runs before rate-limit
    / role-check. Rejects audit as `reject` with the supplied reason.
    `verifyWithReplayProtector(protector, { requireSigned })` adapts the
    existing `ReplayProtector` for the hook. `encodeSignedFrame` /
    `decodeSignedFrame` ship a default
    `[0xff][4B clientId][4B clock][64B HMAC][N B payload]` envelope so
    apps don't have to invent one.
  - **TLS / secure-server helpers (v0.5).** `createSecureHttpServer`
    with strong defaults (TLS 1.2+, conservative cipher list, ALPN
    `http/1.1`, optional CA bundle for mTLS), `applySecurityHeaders` for
    the OWASP-baseline response headers (HSTS, no-sniff, frame deny,
    no-referrer), and `secureHttpHandler(inner)` to wrap an existing
    request handler with the headers + TRACE/TRACK rejection.

  Tests added (+21):

  - `history` — record / list / time-trace, diff added/removed/changed,
    branch + merge, session-driven captures with diff entries.
  - `e2e-encryption` — derive → encrypt → decrypt round-trip,
    cross-salt rejection, wrong-key rejection, export/import preserves
    decryption, key ring grace period, post-grace key drop.
  - `render` — color/label/opacity resolution, stale fading, local-peer
    exclusion, cursor projection by viewport.
  - `replay-wired` — server rejects unsigned frames when
    `requireSigned`, signed frame decodes + clock-tracks, replay
    rejected.
  - `secure-server` — security headers applied, TRACE/TRACK rejected
    via raw socket (undici blocks TRACE client-side).
  - `persistence-s3` — append + load round-trip, compact replaces snap
    and clears log, drop removes everything.

  Plan doc has updated v0.2 / v0.5 / v0.7 / v1.0 status badges. v0.5
  and v0.7 and v1.0 are now ☑ on every item that lives inside these
  two packages; remaining work for v0.5 (Redis persistence,
  full-bucket histograms) and v0.7 (`AutomergeHistorySidecar`) is
  opt-in extension that doesn't block GA.

  plan for v0.2, v0.3, v0.4, v0.5, v0.7, and v1.0. **+37 tests, total
  164 passing.**

  `@ifc-lite/collab`

  - **`AutomergeHistorySidecar`** (v0.7): real `@automerge/automerge`
    3.x implementation. Same `HistorySidecar` interface as the in-memory
    variant; adds binary `save()` / `load(bytes)` for
    cross-restart persistence. Branches and merges round-trip through
    the Automerge doc.
  - **`buildBranchTree(sidecar)`** (v0.7): pure-data branch-tree
    builder. Returns `{ nodes, edges, branches }` with `branch-anchor` /
    `entry` / `merge` node kinds and `history` / `fork` / `merge` edge
    kinds. Apps render this directly into git-log columns or
    force-directed graphs.
  - **Parametric mesh primitives** (v0.3): pure-TS reference kernel.
    `paramsToMesh(source, params)` ships `extruded-area-solid`, `box`,
    `cylinder`, and `revolved-area-solid`. `hashMesh(mesh)` returns a
    32-hex content hash for cache keys.
  - **Determinism harness** (v0.3 / open #5):
    `runDeterminismHarness(kernel, fixtures, expected)` + a
    `DEFAULT_FIXTURES` set covering every primitive. CI runs this on
    every platform and fails on drift.
  - **`createWebRtcProvider`** (v0.2 §8.1): wraps `y-webrtc` lazily so
    consumers who don't use it pay no bundle cost. Same status /
    whenSynced shape as the websocket provider.
  - **`createNumericRegistryAdapter(registry)`** (v0.4): bridges the
    renderer's existing numeric-offset `FederationRegistry` into our
    string-shaped `FederationResolver` without forcing
    `@ifc-lite/collab` to depend on the renderer.
  - **`installIfc4ToIfc4x3Migration()`** (v1.0): sample registered
    schema migration that renames `Pset_<…>::<key>` attributes into
    the `bsi::ifc::v5a::Pset_<…>::<key>` namespace. Demonstrates the
    migration plumb for consumers.
  - **`createPresenceOverlay({ container, viewport })`** (v0.2): drop-in
    2D canvas overlay that consumes a `PresenceMap` and draws other
    peers' cursors + label badges. `update(peers)` redraws; auto-resizes
    via `ResizeObserver`. Pairs with `peerVisuals` for any DOM viewer.

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server`

  - **`RedisPersistence`** (v0.5): `Persistence` against a
    `RedisLikeClient` interface (ioredis / node-redis 4+ satisfy it).
    Layout: `<prefix><roomId>:snap` for compacted state, list
    `<prefix><roomId>:log` for rolling frames. Implements
    load / append / compact / drop.
  - **Bucketed histograms** (v0.5): `MetricsRegistry.bucketedHistogram(
name, buckets, help)` accumulates observations into upper-bound
    buckets and renders as a proper Prometheus `histogram` type with
    `le="<bound>"` bucket labels.

  Tests added (+37): Automerge sidecar record / save+load / diff /
  branch+merge; branch-tree anchor + history edges, fork edges, merge
  edges with merge-from-branch annotation; parametric primitives shapes

  - deterministic hashes + dispatch errors; determinism harness happy
    path + drift detection; numeric registry adapter forwarding + numeric
    guard; IFC4 → IFC4X3 sample migration verifying renames; Redis
    persistence append/load + compact/clear + drop; bucketed histograms
    counts + label dimensions + empty-bucket guard.

  Plan doc: v0.2 ☑ (overlay shipped), v0.3 ☑ (parametric kernel +
  determinism harness), v0.4 ☑ (numeric registry adapter), v0.5 ☑
  (Redis + bucket histograms), v0.7 ☑ (Automerge sidecar + branch
  tree). v1.0 was already ☑; the sample migration finishes the §1.x
  "actually IFC schema migrations" caveat.

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `@ifc-lite/collab` follow-up: deterministic per-user color hash exposed
  publicly (`colorForUser`, `DEFAULT_USER_PALETTE`, `fnv1a`) and consumed
  automatically by `Presence.setUser` when the caller doesn't supply a color.
  `UserIdentity.color` is now optional.

  Conflict detector tightened: only flags concurrent deletes (not creates) at
  the entity top level, and now also surfaces concurrent Pset-creation as a
  `pset-property` event keyed by Pset name.

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server` follow-up: an append-only audit log
  (`AuditSink`, `MemoryAuditSink`, `noopAuditSink`, `shortHash`) that records
  `(timestamp, user, room, op-type, op-hash)` for every connect, sync,
  update, awareness, and reject event; and a per-peer rate limiter
  (`createRateLimiter`, `RateLimitOptions`) wired into the room's update
  filter. Editor-or-better roles get a 200-token / 60-tps default bucket;
  `startCollabServer` accepts a function form so service accounts can have
  tighter budgets than humans.

  Tests added: 23 new (color, audit + rate limit, disconnect/reconnect,
  property-based convergence with seeded random traces, conflict scenarios
  for each `ConflictKind`, broader entity-op coverage). Total now 49.

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - v0.1 Foundation of `@ifc-lite/collab` — real-time collaborative BIM via CRDT
  on IFCX, plus a reference websocket sync server. New packages.

  `@ifc-lite/collab` ships:

  - Y.Doc schema with `entities` / `relationships` / `geometry` top-level
    shared types and helpers for every operation in the spec §6 table
    (create, delete, set attribute, set Pset property, hierarchy move, type
    promotion, relationship target add/remove, geometry param/blob updates).
  - IFCX seed (`seedFromIfcx`) and snapshot (`snapshotToIfcx`) with full
    round-trip against the buildingSMART hello-wall fixture.
  - Per-user layer extraction filtered by `clientID`.
  - IndexedDB and websocket providers, plus an in-memory provider for tests.
  - Awareness / presence helpers (3D + 2D cursors, selection, camera, view,
    section, isolation, tool, status) at 30 Hz with stale eviction.
  - Y.UndoManager wrapper scoped to a local-origin tag, so a peer's `undo()`
    only rolls back their own edits.
  - Conflict detector backed by `Transaction.changed` (catches LWW losses
    even when `YEvent.keys` is empty).
  - `createCollabSession` glues the above into the public façade documented
    in spec §16.2.

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server` ships:

  - `y-websocket`-compatible sync (`y-protocols/sync` + awareness on the
    same socket).
  - In-memory and append-only-file persistence with periodic compaction.
  - JWT auth hook (`AuthenticateFn`) and role-based write capability check.
  - Healthcheck endpoint and clean shutdown.
  - `ifc-lite-collab-server` CLI binary.

  Tests cover schema round-trips, the buildingSMART hello-wall fixture,
  two-peer convergence with conflict-detector firing on both peers,
  end-to-end sync through the websocket server, undo isolation, and
  per-user layer extraction.

  See `docs/architecture/collab-plan.md` for the v0.1 → v1.0 roadmap.

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Continuing the v0.1 → v1.0 plan. Lands foundational pieces of v0.3
  (geometry), v0.4 (federation), and v0.6 (MCP) so each upstack consumer
  has stable shapes to build on.

  `@ifc-lite/collab`

  - Blob store: content-addressed put/get/has/delete/list with a stable
    32-hex `fnv128` hasher. Backends: `MemoryBlobStore`,
    `createIndexedDbBlobStore` (browser only, lazy-loaded), `HttpBlobStore`,
    and `LayeredBlobStore(local, remote)` for local-first read-through and
    parallel write-through.
  - CSG-tree CRDT: `ensureCSGTree`, `appendCSGOp`, `insertCSGOp`,
    `removeCSGOp`, `moveCSGOp`, `getCSGOps`. Stored as `Y.Array<CSGOp>` on
    the geometry node's `params.ops` so concurrent appends interleave
    per-peer-relative-order. Order-dependence of the resulting solid is
    documented as a v0.1 limitation; full CRDT-tree merging is open
    problem #4 (v1.x).
  - Conflict UI bridge: `createConflictUIBridge(detector)` folds detector
    events into stable `(kind, path, field)` buckets and emits
    `open` / `update` / `close` lifecycle events. Buckets close on
    idle (`closeAfterMs`, default 4 s) or via explicit `resolve(key)`.
  - Agent presence helper: `markAsAgent`, `agentIdentityFromMcp`,
    `AGENT_PALETTE`. Standardized convention so the viewer can render MCP
    tool peers with a `(agent)` suffix and a distinct color band.
  - `FederationSession` (spec §10): hosts N per-model `CollabSession`s
    plus a shared `_federation` Y.Doc for cross-model
    `FederationRecord`s (clash, RFI, view, BCF refs). Presence is
    project-scoped via the `_federation` doc per §10.2. APIs:
    `createFederationSession`, `addModel`, `removeModel`, `upsertRecord`,
    `getRecord`, `removeRecord`, `listRecords`, `observeRecords`.

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server`

  - Blob HTTP route: `PUT /blobs/<hash>`, `GET /blobs/<hash>`,
    `HEAD /blobs/<hash>`, `DELETE /blobs/<hash>`, `GET /blobs` (list).
    Pluggable `ServerBlobStorage` (default `InMemoryBlobStorage`,
    swappable for S3/disk) and configurable `blobMaxBytes` (default
    100 MB) for payload-too-large rejection.

  Tests added (+22, now 71 total — all passing): blob store backends,
  CSG concurrent appends, UI-bridge open/update/close + explicit resolve,
  agent presence (suffix idempotence, deterministic id from MCP input),
  FederationSession (multi-model rooms, record CRUD, observeRecords), and
  the server's blob route end-to-end (round-trip, malformed-hash 400,
  413 on payload-too-large).

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Continuing the plan. Lands the production observability stack (v0.5),
  blob GC (v0.3 / open #6), GDPR helpers (v1.0), and the worker-safe
  snapshot entry point (v0.1 deferred).

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server`

  - `SnapshotWorker`: periodic per-room IFCX export to a writable
    directory. `runOnce()` for tests / cron. Skips idle rooms by default;
    `includeIdle: true` covers them too. Adds `@ifc-lite/collab` as a
    dep so we can call `snapshotToIfcx` directly.
  - `MetricsRegistry` + Prometheus-text `/metrics` endpoint. Ships
    counter/gauge/lightweight-histogram. Built dependency-free so we can
    swap in `prom-client` later without API churn. Surfaces
    `collab_rooms`, `collab_room_peers{room}`, `collab_updates_total`,
    `collab_rejects_total{reason}`.
  - `RoomManager.setCounters({ update, reject })` so the server can
    inject metric counters without leaking the registry into the manager.
  - `createReplayProtector({ secret })` (open problem #8): HMAC-SHA256
    verifier for `(clientId, clock, payload)` envelopes with strict
    monotonic-clock enforcement. `computeHmac` is exported so non-Node
    clients can produce matching tags.

  `@ifc-lite/collab`

  - `BlobStore.stat(hash)` (optional): returns `BlobMeta` without
    downloading the bytes. Implemented for `MemoryBlobStore`,
    `createIndexedDbBlobStore`, and `HttpBlobStore` (HEAD).
  - Blob GC (open problem #6): `collectReferencedBlobHashes(doc)`,
    `planBlobSweep(store, referenced, { epochMs })`, `sweepBlobs(store,
decision)`. Walks every entity's `geometryRef.geomId` → resolves
    `blobHash`, also collects any 32-hex string in `geometry.params.*`
    so apps that store auxiliary refs in params survive.
  - GDPR helpers: `exportAndLeave(session, { snapshot, serverDelete })`
    snapshots to IFCX, marks presence offline, runs the optional remote
    hard-delete hook, then disposes. `redactAuthorMeta(session)` blanks
    per-entity `createdBy` / `lastEditedBy` for anonymised exports.
  - Worker-safe snapshot entry: new sub-export
    `@ifc-lite/collab/snapshot/worker` ships `runSnapshotWorker(self)`,
    a postMessage adapter that mounts a `(snapshot|seed)` request handler
    on a `DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope`. The pure `snapshotToIfcx` /
    `seedFromIfcx` helpers are also re-exported from this entry point so
    consumers that don't want the adapter still get a worker-clean
    surface.

  Tests added (+18, total 101 passing): blob GC end-to-end (collect →
  plan → sweep, plus epoch grace window), GDPR `exportAndLeave` happy
  path / hook ok / hook failure / `redactAuthorMeta`, snapshot worker
  postMessage round-trip (snapshot, seed, error report), server-side
  `SnapshotWorker` writing IFCX files, metrics counters / gauges /
  histogram and the `/metrics` endpoint serving Prometheus text, and
  replay-protector HMAC happy path / tampered MAC / replay / payload
  mismatch.

  Plan doc updated with v0.3 / v0.5 / v1.0 status badges.

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Continuing the plan. Lands operational v0.5 pieces, the v0.7 branching
  starter, and v1.0 schema-migration scaffolding.

  `@ifc-lite/collab-server`

  - `JsonlFileAuditSink`: append-only NDJSON file sink with size-based
    rotation (`rotateAtBytes`) and an opt-in `fsync`-after-append mode for
    durable audit trails.
  - Idle room unloading: `idleUnloadMs` knob plumbed end to end. The
    manager runs an internal `unref()`'d sweep timer at half the idle
    window; `sweepIdle()` is also callable directly. Persistence keeps the
    durable copy, so unloading is non-destructive.
  - Retention policy: `planRetention(dir, policy)` + `applyRetention`.
    Honors `fullLogDays` (default 90), `snapshotsDays` (default 5y), and
    `maxBytesPerRoom` (trim oldest first). Pluggable file classifier so
    custom naming schemes work too.
  - `RoomManager.stats()` returns `(roomId, peerCount, idleMs)` triples
    for diagnostics and tests.

  `@ifc-lite/collab`

  - Schema-version helpers (open problem #2 prep): `getSchemaVersion`,
    `setSchemaVersion`, `registerSchemaMigration`, `migrateSchema`, plus
    a `MIGRATION_ORIGIN` symbol so observers can filter migration
    transactions out of e.g. undo stacks.
  - v0.7 branching starter: `forkSession(parent, { name })` snapshots the
    parent's Y.Doc, seeds a fresh sibling session, and stamps
    `meta.branch.parentRoomId` / `branch.name` / `branch.forkedAt`.
    `mergeBranch(parent, branch, strategy)` implements both `'ops'`
    (Y-update apply with last-write-wins on conflicts) and `'layer'`
    (IFCX snapshot + non-resetting re-seed). Returns a small
    `MergeReport`. `readBranchMeta` exposes the metadata back.

  Tests added (+12, total 83 passing): JSONL append + rotation, retention
  plan + apply (full-log days, snapshots days, maxBytesPerRoom),
  RoomManager idle sweep with both empty and busy rooms, schema-version
  round-trip + a sample migration that renames an attribute namespace,
  and end-to-end branch fork → divergent edits → merge for both strategies
  including a non-conflicting parent-edit-survives case.

- [#616](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/616) [`2fc15b4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2fc15b45fbd06ebb57120d87db9a0ab06ed18142) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Continuing the plan. Lands the differential layer composer (v0.7), the
  property unit converter (v1.0 / open problem #3), conflict resolver
  actions on the UI bridge, the `FederationResolver` interface, and the
  network-latency simulation perf harness (v0.2).

  - `extractMinimalLayer(doc, baseline, opts)`: produces an IFCX layer
    containing only the entities and fields that changed since
    `baseline`. Entities created since baseline are emitted whole;
    entities that already existed only get their changed attributes /
    children / inherits keys. Toggle whether updated values count as
    diffs via `includeUpdatedValues`.

  - `convertEntityUnits(doc, from, to)` walks every Pset and converts
    numeric `PropertyValue`s with a matching `unit`. Ships SI-relative
    scale tables for length (m/cm/mm/in/ft), area (m²/cm²/mm²/ft²/in²),
    volume (m³/cm³/mm³/L), and angle (rad/deg). `convertValue(value,
from, to)` is exposed for one-shot conversions. `familyOf(unit)`
    classifies a unit string.

  - Conflict UI bridge: `bridge.keepMine(key)` and `bridge.acceptTheirs(key)`
    run registered handlers (per `ConflictKind`) and close the bucket.
    Handlers receive `{ bucket }` and are responsible for emitting the
    follow-up CRDT edit.

  - `FederationResolver` interface: typed `toGlobalId / fromGlobalId /
getModelForGlobalId` contract. `passThroughResolver` is the default
    for IFCX UUID paths (globally unique by construction).
    `createMapBackedResolver(table)` covers explicit lookup tables. The
    renderer's existing numeric-offset `FederationRegistry` can be
    wrapped to satisfy the interface without forcing `@ifc-lite/collab`
    to depend on the renderer (adapter snippet documented in source).

  - `createLatencyChannel(a, b, { baseMs, jitterMs, dropRate, random })`
    wraps a pair of Y.Docs with a queued, time-bucketed update channel.
    `flushUntil(t)` advances simulated time and dispatches due updates.
    Useful for benchmarking the §15 perf budget under simulated network
    conditions.

  Tests added (+18, total 119 passing): minimal-layer round-trips and
  diff-only behaviour, unit conversion across families plus skipping on
  mismatched unit, bridge `keepMine` / `acceptTheirs` lifecycle including
  follow-up CRDT writes from handlers, resolver pass-through and
  map-backed lookups, latency channel arrival-time behaviour and
  deterministic drop rate under a seeded PRNG.
