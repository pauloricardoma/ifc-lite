/**
 * "Does the relay hold what I wrote?" (#4446)
 *
 * A local `doc.transact` resolves the moment the update is in the owner's
 * own Y.Doc; y-websocket then hands the bytes to the browser's socket, where
 * they sit in renderer-side send quota until the network stack drains them.
 * A tab closed in that window loses them — the relay never saw the seed,
 * and the next joiner reconstructs an empty room. No y-websocket event says
 * "the server has applied your update": the server forwards updates to the
 * OTHER peers and stays silent towards the origin.
 *
 * What the server does say, on every new connection, is its state vector —
 * step 1 of the y-protocols sync handshake. So a throw-away connection to
 * the room reads exactly "what the relay holds", a few dozen bytes, and
 * `stateVectorCovers` compares it with the owner's own state vector. The
 * probe sends nothing (no awareness, no updates), so peers never see it.
 */
