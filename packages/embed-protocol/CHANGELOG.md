# @ifc-lite/embed-protocol

## 1.14.7

### Patch Changes

- [#1691](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1691) [`26af236`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/26af236a9128f5fc97493d75d7c9642958343a7a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Documentation moved to https://ifclite.dev/docs/ - README links and package homepage fields now point at the new home (the GitHub Pages site remains as a mirror whose canonical URLs point there).

## 1.14.6

### Patch Changes

- [#1676](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1676) [`da04601`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/da0460183dcb4e2b26ceb53cfebd8cca33c78c39) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Docs refresh: correct stale README claims and API samples against the current codebase; add READMEs to the ten published packages that shipped without one (cli, create, sdk, sandbox, lens, lists, embed-sdk, embed-protocol, encoding, viewer-core).

- [#1678](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1678) [`a90182b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a90182bac110fdd4c15b8b51866e31deefc0378e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Package metadata hygiene: correct the @ifc-lite/codegen license field to MPL-2.0 (the source has always carried MPL headers; the MIT value was a scaffolding accident) and give it a files allowlist so the npm tarball ships dist, schemas, and README instead of the whole package directory. Add the missing publishConfig, homepage, and bugs fields to codegen, embed-protocol, embed-sdk, and wasm, and homepage/bugs to create-ifc-lite, matching the rest of the workspace.

## 1.14.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1036](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1036) [`0205c4d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0205c4d50995572ef796ce66877aa389f19c6fbc) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add a `default` condition to every package's exports map. The maps only
  declared `import` + `types`, so any resolver hitting the CJS/default
  condition path (tsx, jest, plain `require`, some bundlers) failed with
  ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED. The `default` entry points at the same
  ESM dist file; pure ESM consumers are unaffected.

## 1.14.4

### Patch Changes

- [#760](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/760) [`1282b13`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/1282b13fbaf8db90197ebd3d272f59d3031810ed) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Ship compiled JavaScript instead of raw TypeScript source.

  Both packages previously published with `main`/`types`/`exports` pointing at
  `./src/index.ts` and no build step, so the tarball contained only
  `src/index.ts`. A plain `npm install` + `import` failed with
  `Unknown file extension ".ts"` in Node, and the packages were fragile under
  `tsc`, Jest, ts-node, and non-esbuild bundlers — despite `@ifc-lite/embed-sdk`
  being intended for external embedding (Power BI, Superset, Grafana).

  They now build with `tsc` to `dist/` and export `./dist/index.js` +
  `./dist/index.d.ts`, matching every other publishable package in the repo.
