/**
 * github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2490: `parseStepValue` un-doubled the
 * two ISO 10303-21 doublings with a directive-blind regex and stopped there, so
 * it never resolved a backslash DIRECTIVE and diverged from the shared decoder
 * on every non-ASCII value a real IFC file carries.
 *
 * The two halves of this file are the two halves of the contract, and both have
 * to hold at once — which is the reason the old regex could not simply grow a
 * `decodeIfcString` call after it:
 *
 *   - a literal from a REAL FILE now decodes its directives (the first block);
 *   - a value written by this module's own `escapeStepString` still comes back
 *     byte-identical (the second block), including a value that merely LOOKS
 *     like a directive: `escapeStepString` doubles every reverse solidus in
 *     the caller's text, so `\X2\00FC\X0\` typed by a user becomes
 *     `\\X2\\00FC\\X0\\` on disk, and giving directives precedence in the
 *     scan is exactly what keeps that doubled form reading back as the
 *     LITERAL text `\X2\00FC\X0\` rather than decoding to `ü`.
 *
 * Note how the fixtures are built. A source literal is spelled with explicit
 * `\\` in the TS string so the file says what bytes are on disk; the expected
 * value is spelled the same way. Getting that backwards is how a test of an
 * escaping function passes without testing anything.
