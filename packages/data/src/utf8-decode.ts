/**
 * SAB-safe wrapper around `TextDecoder.decode()`.
 *
 * Both Firefox and Chromium reject `TextDecoder.decode(view)` when `view`
 * is backed by a `SharedArrayBuffer` (Spectre timing-attack mitigation).
 * The parser intentionally hands the source bytes around as a SAB so the
 * parser worker, geometry workers, and main-thread on-demand extractors
 * all read the same memory zero-copy — which means every decode of a
 * subarray of the source needs to be SAB-aware.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   1. Detect the runtime's SAB-decode policy lazily, once. The result is
 *      stable for the lifetime of the realm.
 *   2. When the runtime accepts SAB views, decode straight off the source
 *      (zero-copy, ~10 ns per call).
 *   3. When it rejects, copy the requested subarray into a thread-local
 *      scratch `Uint8Array` first, then decode. The scratch buffer grows
 *      to the largest seen subarray *up to* `MAX_RETAINED_SCRATCH_BYTES`
 *      and is reused, so the GC pressure is bounded even for
 *      million-entity files. Anything larger gets a throwaway buffer and
 *      nothing is retained (see below).
 *
 * Performance: the typical IFC entity decode is 50–500 bytes, so the copy
 * path is microseconds per call. The hot batch decode path
 * (`columnar-parser-attributes.ts`) already routes through scratch
 * buffers, so only the per-entity attribute reads + schema detection +
 * tokenizer fallback go through this helper.
 *
 * Why the scratch is capped (#2183): "grows to the largest seen subarray"
 * is the right trade for the 50–500 byte reads this helper was written
 * for, but it makes a *single* whole-file decode permanent. A caller that
 * hands the entire source in (the viewer's grid / alignment / symbolic
 * overlay parses did exactly that) pushes the doubling scratch to the
 * next power of two above the file size and it is never released: a
 * 342 MB model pinned 512 MB for the lifetime of the realm, measured as
 * 30% of the whole main-thread heap. Reuse only pays off when a buffer is
 * hit repeatedly, which a one-off giant decode never is, so above
 * `MAX_RETAINED_SCRATCH_BYTES` we allocate a throwaway and let the GC
 * have it. The cap is far above every decode on the hot path, so those
 * callers keep the exact same reused buffer they had before.
