/**
 * Entity names the bundled schema tables do not state, and the names they
 * mean.
 *
 * Two different relations live here, and they are NOT interchangeable — one is
 * a narrowing, the other is an equality, and the descendant direction reads
 * them differently:
 *
 * - {@link ENTITY_NAME_ALIASES} maps a leaf that appears in NO bundled table to
 *   its nearest schema-known SUPERTYPE. Walking up, the leaf resolves to that
 *   supertype. Walking down, the supertype gains the leaf — but the leaf must
 *   not gain its siblings.
 * - {@link CROSS_SCHEMA_RENAMES} pairs two names that are the SAME class under
 *   two schema versions. Both directions hold: either spelling has to reach the
 *   other's subtree, or a file's `FILE_SCHEMA` header decides whether a
 *   caller's own spelling works.
 *
 * This is the descendant-direction copy. `packages/parser/src/ifc-schema.ts`
 * holds the ancestor-direction one and cannot be imported here, because the
 * dependency runs parser -> data. `query-backend-maps.test.ts` pins every row
 * of the parser copy against this one's observable behaviour, which is what
 * keeps the two from drifting.
 *
 * `rust/core/src/legacy_entities.rs` is the third home for this knowledge and
 * carries both relations mixed together, because the Rust side only ever needs
 * "what modern type do I treat this record as". Its rows that name a leaf
 * present in some bundled table (`IFCWALLSTANDARDCASE`, `IFCPROXY`,
 * `IFCELECTRICALELEMENT`, …) need no row here: the union of the three tables
 * already states their parent. Pinned by
 * `packages/parser/test/query-backend-maps.test.ts`.
 */

/**
 * Leaf (UPPERCASE) → nearest schema-known supertype, for leaves absent from
 * ALL THREE bundled tables.
 *
 * IFC4.3 stratum subtypes (issue #860) — the schema only has the abstract
 * `IfcGeotechnicalStratum`, real models emit one of these three leaves with a
 * PredefinedType pinned (SOLID / VOID / WATER).
 *
 * There was a fourth row here, `IFCELECTRICALDISTRIBUTIONPOINT`. The IFC2X3
 * entity is `IfcElectricDistributionPoint` — no "AL" — so the key named nothing
 * and the row could never fire. Removed rather than respelled (#3172): the
 * correctly spelled name IS in `ENTITIES_IFC2X3`, so the union already resolves
 * it and an alias would be a second, shadowing answer. This table's mandate is
 * narrower than `legacy_entities.rs`'s: only names absent from all three
 * bundled tables belong here, which is why the five IFC2X3 products that fix
 * added on the Rust side have no row here either.
