/**
 * `between` display folding for the rule editor (#5138 plan §6's operator
 * table): the persisted `RuleBlock.groups` never gains a `between` rule
 * kind — it stays a plain `gte` rule plus a plain `lte` rule on the same
 * subject, exactly the vocabulary `readSubject`/`filter-ops.ts` already
 * understand (plan §3, §4). "Between" only exists here, as a pure display
 * transform the editor applies on load (fold) and reverses on save
 * (unfold), so `RuleBlockEditor` can show ONE range chip instead of two
 * rows that happen to share a subject.
 *
 * Only `property` / `quantity` / `attribute` rules fold — the three
 * element-requirement kinds whose op is `gte`/`lte` at all (ELEMENT_
 * REQUIREMENT_KINDS in `rule-set-io-requirement.ts`; `name`/`type`/
 * `parent`/`material`/`classification` use `StringOp`, `ifcType`/
 * `predefinedType` use `SetOp` — none of those has a numeric bound to
 * pair).

 * a `lte`, or more than one of either, is left as plain rules — folding
 * only ever removes exactly two entries and adds exactly one, never
 * guesses which of several candidates pairs with which.
 *
 * Pairing happens in a PASS OF ITS OWN, before anything is written to
 * `out`: a single combined pass that pushed a `lte` immediately (because
 * it isn't itself a `gte`) and only later discovered, at its `gte`
 * partner's index, that the two pair up, would leave that `lte` in `out`
 * TWICE — once as the plain rule already pushed, once folded inside the
 * chip — so `[lte(300), gte(100)]` (partner before the `gte` that finds
 * it) silently produced three rules on unfold instead of two. Deciding
 * every pair up front means the emitting pass never has to un-push
 * something it already committed.
