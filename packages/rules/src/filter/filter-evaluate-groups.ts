/**
 * Group evaluation (OR-of-AND-groups, #4904).
 *
 * Split out of `filter-evaluate.ts` (allowlisted at 583 lines,
 * `scripts/module-size-allowlist.txt`) rather than grown in place — the
 * ratchet forbids a listed file growing, and this needs its own home
 * regardless: it's the one seam where "groups" become a second concern
 * layered on top of the single-list evaluator, not a change to it.
 *
 * A `FilterGroup[]` ORs its groups together; within each group, the group's
 * own `combinator` still governs (mirrors the selector's `+`: AND within a
 * group, OR across groups). Rather than desugar this into a full-scan pass
 * over some merged rule list — a second matching path that could not answer
 * "why did this match" per-group, and could not be saved — each group is run
 * through the EXACT SAME per-entity evaluator as a single-group query
 * (`evaluateFilterRules(Federated)`), one call per group, unioned by
 * (modelId, expressId). A single group (the overwhelmingly common case,
 * and every query before #4904) takes this function's fast path straight
 * through to the existing single-list evaluator with zero extra overhead.
 *
 * This also means the AND+`op:in` index prefilter is NOT lost for
 * multi-group queries: each group still gets its own prefilter via
 * `selectIterationSource`, same as it would running alone. Measured on
 * `tests/models/buildingsmart/Building-Architecture.ifc` (the largest
 * fixture available on this host; see the PR body for the exact numbers) —
 * a two-group union costs about the sum of the two single-group runs, not a
 * full-scan multiple of it.
