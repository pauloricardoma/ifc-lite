/**
 * User-facing MODEL tags (issue #4215): free-form labels a coordinator puts on
 * the models of a federation ("Building A", "Structure", "Tender") so the same
 * set of models can be picked out again in the hierarchy, the advanced filter,
 * clash set filters and list scope.
 *
 * Not to be confused with:
 *  - the IFC `Tag` attribute on an element (`IfcElement.Tag`, and
 *    `ClashElement.tag` which is the element's IFC class) — these labels never
 *    touch IFC data and manufacture no property set;
 *  - the plugin API's `SourceTag`, which is cloud-source PROVENANCE
 *    (provider / project / file / revision), written by the loader and never
 *    by the user.
 *
 * Identity is the `id`, never the name: a saved rule stores tag ids, so
 * renaming a tag changes what the chip says and nothing about what matches.
 * Assignments are keyed by the runtime model id in the store and by the
 * model's content fingerprint in the portable federation setup file.

 * `hasNone [deleted]` would otherwise be true of every model — the silent
 * broadening the issue forbids — and `hasAny [deleted]` false of every model,
