/**
 * The MODEL-SCOPED rule arm of the evaluator (`filter-evaluate.ts`): `model`
 * and `modelTag` (#4215) are decided by the owning model alone, never by the
 * entity, so one answer per model serves every entity in it.
 *
 * Used twice, by design: as the per-entity arm (so OR keeps its boolean
 * meaning — a model failing the tag condition still contributes entities that
 * pass the other side of the OR) and as the whole-model prune under AND (a
 * model that fails any model-scoped rule can contribute no entity, so its scan
 * is skipped). Same function both times, so the two cannot disagree.
