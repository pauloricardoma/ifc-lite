 * How a rule reads one of its strings — the producer saying so, because the
 * string itself cannot.
 *
 * `'regex'` is a regular-expression SOURCE: the WHOLE string is the pattern,
 * slashes included. `'literal'` is exact text that is never a pattern, however
 * it happens to be spelled. Absent means free text a human typed into a chip
 * field, which keeps the Lists-panel convention (#1591): a `/body/flags`
 * literal is a pattern, anything else is plain text.
 *
 * Guessing this back out of the text is the #4091 defect class — matched the
 * wrong thing, said nothing — reappearing at the adapter seam. The selector
 * grammar knows which it parsed: quoting is its ONLY escape hatch for a
 * literal name, so `"/Wall/".FireRating` is the plain name `/Wall/`, and
 * `Name=/\/tmp\//` is the source `/tmp/`. Sniffed for slashes, the first
 * matches every `…Wall…` set and the second matches `tmp`.
 *
 * A property-set or property NAME has no operator beside it, so both kinds
 * have to be declared. A VALUE's op already says whether it is a pattern, so
 * only `'regex'` is ever recorded there.
