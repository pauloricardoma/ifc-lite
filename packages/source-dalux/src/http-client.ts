 * eagerly loading an entire (potentially huge) tenant into memory before
 * returning the first row.
 *
 * A `nextPage` link, when present, is authoritative and is always followed —
 * even when the page it's attached to has zero items or reports
 * `totalRemainingItems: 0`. That's a legitimate bookmark-pager shape: the
 * server can signal "keep going" via the link while the counters on this
 * particular page look like "done", with the real end only reached once a
 * later page comes back both empty *and* linkless. Treating an empty or
 * remaining-0 page as terminal whenever it still carries a `nextPage` link
 * would silently truncate a listing that in fact had more pages.
 *
 * A `nextPage` link with no bookmark throws {@link DaluxPaginationError}
 * instead of returning as if the page were simply the last one — that shape
 * can't be reconciled with "the listing is done".
 *
 * A `nextPage` link whose bookmark echoes the one just requested is more
 * subtle: `/6.1/projects/.../file_areas/.../files` has been observed live
 * re-sending the same bookmark on what is genuinely the final page (a 0-item
 * page, `totalRemainingItems: 0`) instead of ever omitting the `nextPage`
 * link, matching how the original Dalux Box integration (ifc-lite#1761) and
 * An unofficial third-party reference client (github.com/bruadam/dalux-build,
 * `javascript/src/utils/pagination.js`, `paginate()`) both already treat a
 * repeated bookmark: a clean end, not an error. But Dalux's API is not
 * reliable enough to trust that an echoed bookmark *always* means "done" —
 * only that an echoed bookmark carrying zero items safely does, per what's
 * actually been observed. If the repeating page still has items on it, the
 * server has stopped making forward progress while real data remains
 * unread, which is exactly the truncation this error exists to catch — so
 * that case still throws, it just no longer conflates "bookmark repeated"
 * with "nothing left to read".
 *
 * `metadata.totalRemainingItems` is *not* treated as authoritative for "is
 * this the last page" on its own: Dalux's reference client only ever logs
 * it, and it can be positive on a page that is genuinely the last one — e.g.
 * `/5.1/projects` reporting `1` remaining while describing the sole project
 * and sending no `nextPage` link at all — so erroring on that combination
 * alone would reject a perfectly valid single-project (and single-final-page)
 * response instead of completing the listing.
