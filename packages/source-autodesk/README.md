# Autodesk cloud sources

`@ifc-lite/source-autodesk` integrates Autodesk Forma Data Management (Docs/ACC), Data Exchange resources and Forma Site Design proposal catalogs with IFClite's native source loader.

## Configure the viewer

For static hosting, register an APS **public application with PKCE**, enable the required products, and register exactly:

```
https://your-viewer.example/oauth/autodesk/callback
```

Set `VITE_AUTODESK_CLIENT_ID` at viewer build time, or enter the public application ID in Autodesk source settings. Never put a client secret in a `VITE_` variable or browser preference. The account administrator must authorize the application in Custom Integrations; user sign-in alone does not grant project access. The provider requests `data:read user-profile:read` and stores tokens only in memory. Reloading a static viewer requires signing in again.

For hosted sessions, set `VITE_AUTODESK_HOSTED=true`, deploy [the Autodesk service](../../apps/autodesk-service/README.md) and reverse-proxy `/api/autodesk/*` on the viewer's origin. Register the service callback rather than the static callback. No end-user application ID entry is needed. The browser never receives Autodesk tokens.

The deployment uses one operator-managed APS application. Each user signs in with their own Autodesk account and retains that account's product entitlements and project permissions; the operator's personal account does not need access to their models. A successful sign-in does not grant product or project access. Real import verification can use consenting production users with existing subscriptions and accessible projects.

Both modes use one connection, verified account identity, PKCE, cryptographic state, explicit cancellation, a BroadcastChannel callback compatible with COOP, and a same-tab fallback when popups are blocked. Disconnect preserves models already loaded in memory.

## Browse and load

Open **Cloud sources → Autodesk Forma / Data Exchange → Sign in**. Browse projects by account, then choose Files or Data Exchanges. Folders page incrementally; unsupported authoring files show the reason they cannot load. IFC, IFCX/IFC5 and GLB file artifacts use the normal viewer loader. Every download pins a version and verifies version ownership before resolving its storage. Source updates also pin their listing version.

For Site Design, paste a documented Forma link containing `siteId` or `/sites/<id>` into the project entry. The `.com` / `.eu` host selects US / EMEA. Linked sites are remembered per signed-in account. Site discovery is link-driven; this does not claim to enumerate every accessible site. Documented ACC Docs project/folder links resolve through the account’s accessible projects. Proposal resource names remain distinct from generated `.ifcx` filenames.

Hub discovery reads Autodesk's documented `attributes.region` and routes subsequent requests to that region. This release supports US and EMEA hubs; other regional hubs report an explicit unsupported-region error rather than being sent to US.

## Native generated artifacts

Data Exchanges and Site Design proposals are **not IFC files**. Their rows are unavailable until the hosted service advertises an installed native artifact adapter. A metadata catalog or Autodesk Viewer derivative is not a native import. The service verifies adapter revision and format, and enforces session ownership and a byte limit. Conversion adapters must preserve geometry, properties, transforms, units and source identity for the selected snapshot and must report fidelity limitations.

The hosted service includes a Rust immutable Forma snapshot converter and a Windows .NET 8 Autodesk SDK exchange worker. Configure their executable paths or the authenticated remote Windows worker as described in [the service guide](../../apps/autodesk-service/README.md). Files and proposals support explicit historical version selection. Whole-exchange IFC export supports the current version only; the worker checks Docs version and exchange snapshot before/after export and rejects a changed source. Proposal meshes preserve occurrences, geometry, placement, color/opacity and source properties; the details panel identifies appearance/overlay limitations.

Hosted imports have a 15-minute client deadline, including preparation, status requests and artifact download. Timeout or cancellation releases an unconsumed server job; cleanup requests have their own five-second deadline.

No live Autodesk account or import fidelity was verified during local implementation. Tests exercise decoded upstream-shaped fixtures and session/security invariants.
