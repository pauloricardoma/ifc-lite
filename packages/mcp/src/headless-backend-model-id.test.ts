/**
 * One backend, one answer to "is this a model id I hold".
 *
 * The MCP backend used to hold two rules for one question: `bim.mutate.*` was
 * gated on `modelId || modelName`, while the schedule assert in the same class
 * admitted `modelId` alone, and no other MCP site accepts a file basename at
 * all. So the basename was writable and unreadable in the same session, and
 * which surface a caller reached first decided whether their id worked (#3764).
 *
 * The fixture is the case that separates them: a file whose name is nothing
 * like its model id.
