/**
 * The pending-mutation overlay, in the shape the server's read surface needs to
 * read it. One reader for every tool: `model_diff` (#2000) and, since #2004, the
 * query backend, `model_info` and `count_entities`.
 *
 * A `model_id` on this server does not name a file — it names a session model,
 * and `entity_set_property` / `entity_set_attribute` / `entity_create` /
 * `entity_delete` queue their edits in a `MutablePropertyView` overlay that the
 * parsed `IfcDataStore` never sees (the store's buffer and index are immutable;
 * the overlay materialises at `export_ifc` / `model_save` time).
 *
 * Read straight from the store, a tool therefore answers about the file as it
 * was parsed. That is the wrong answer for the caller most likely to ask: an
 * agent edits, reads back to confirm, and is told its edit did not happen — and
 * the natural recovery from that is to edit again.
 *
 * **Reads fold the overlay in silently; the payload then says how many edits are
 * queued.** Folding is what makes "what is there now" answerable at all, and
 * `query_entities`' filters make it non-negotiable: a query for the value an
 * agent just wrote has to find it, and a tool that reported the divergence
 * instead of folding would still return the pre-edit row set. Reporting is what
 * keeps the answer honest about not being on disk yet — `pendingMutations` is
 * absent, not zero, on a session that has never been edited, so nothing changes
 * for a read-only caller.

 * on an `IfcTypeObject`, so `objectType` and `PredefinedType` are read from the
 * store for store entities and simply absent for created ones.
 *
 * **The `IfcRoot` half of that sentence is a precondition, not a description**,
 * and `entity_create` accepts any IFC class. Slot 0 of an
 * `IfcPropertySingleValue` is its `Name`, so reading it positionally turned
 * `entity_create('IfcPropertySingleValue', ["'Width'", …])` into an entity whose
 * GlobalId was `Width` — which then joined the cross-model identity list, so
 * `get_entity(global_id: 'Width')` resolved to a property value, `model_diff`
 * reported `Width` as an added entity, and `get_entities_bulk` could call it an
 * ambiguous GlobalId. This is the same hazard `indexQueuedRelations` avoids by
 * resolving relationship ends by attribute name, and the same one the columnar
 * parser hits when it keys an `IfcMaterial` on the Name in slot 0.
 *
 * So the header is read only when the class actually derives from `IfcRoot`,
 * cross-schema (#2003) so an IFC2X3- or IFC4X3-only root is not judged by the
 * IFC4 pin. A class no bundled schema declares has no chain to prove it is a
 * root, so it keeps an empty header — the same deliberate vendor gap
 * `diff-scope.ts` documents, and the safe direction: an unidentified entity is
 * merely unreachable by GlobalId, whereas a wrongly identified one corrupts the
 * identity space every other tool shares.
 *
 * `globalId` also comes back empty when slot 0 holds none — a created
 * `IfcCartesianPoint` has no cross-model identity, and neither has a created
 * root the caller left unidentified. Those are excluded from `created` (nothing
 * can compare or look them up by key) but stay reachable by expressId, because
