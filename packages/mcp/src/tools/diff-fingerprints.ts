/**
 * The MCP server's adapter onto the real `@ifc-lite/diff` engine (issue #1891).
 *
 * `model_diff` on its own answers "what changed at the type and identity
 * level" — counts per type, GlobalIds added and removed. That answer is wrong
 * in the most damaging way the moment the two models came from a from-scratch
 * re-export: every GlobalId is new, so the whole model reads as
 * deleted-and-added. `by_content: true` routes the same two loaded models
 * through the engine's content-keyed matching pass instead.
 *
 * **Data scope only, on purpose.** Node has no geometry pipeline here: no
 * meshes, so no world geometry hash and no bounding box. Rather than pretend
 * otherwise the handler passes `scope: 'data'`, which is the honest description
 * of what it can see — the engine then classifies every unambiguous 1:1 content
 * match as `renamed` and reports every genuinely ambiguous group as a group,
 * exactly as it does for a viewer session whose geometry hashing was
 * unavailable.
 *
 * **Scope of the comparison: every `IfcObjectDefinition` in the model.** IFC's
 * three `IfcRoot` branches are not equally comparable. An `IfcObjectDefinition`
 * (every `IfcObject` — product, task, actor, control, resource, group — plus
 * `IfcTypeObject` and `IfcContext`) is an independently identifiable thing. The
 * other two branches are dependent and stay out:
 *
 * - `IfcRelationship`: its identity is its endpoints. Re-GUIDing an
 *   `IfcRelAggregates` while both ends are untouched is not a change anyone
 *   wants reported.
 * - `IfcPropertyDefinition`: a property set's content is already folded into
 *   its owner's `dataHash`, so comparing it again would double-report every
 *   edited property — once on the element, once on the pset.
 *
 * Membership is decided from the inheritance chain of every bundled schema
 * (IFC2X3 + IFC4 + IFC4X3), not from whether the columnar parser happened to
 * put the entity in its `EntityTable`, and not from the IFC4 codegen pin alone.
 * That distinction is the whole fix for a class of silent drop-outs: the table
 * only holds the categories the viewer renders, so `IfcTask`, `IfcActor`,
 * `IfcWorkPlan` and every other non-product `IfcObject` reported an empty
 * GlobalId and vanished from the comparison entirely, even though their STEP
 * records carry one. Those are read straight from the source record instead.
 * (`by_entity` on the same tool still asks the store and so still misses them;
 * that is pre-existing behaviour of a different flag, untouched here.)
 *
 * The same distinction closes the drop-out's mirror image. The parser fills the
 * table's GlobalId column positionally, and for a resource entity slot 0 is not
 * a GlobalId: an `IfcMaterial`, `IfcSurfaceStyle`, `IfcClassification` or
 * `IfcProjectedCRS` was being compared under its *Name*, which put colliding
 * keys into the comparison — a material and a surface style of the same name
 * arriving as one entity. None of them is an `IfcRoot`, so the chain check
 * leaves them out and the key set is unique again.
 *
 * ## Why this is a second copy, and what stops it drifting
 *
 * `packages/cli/src/commands/diff-engine.ts` and its `diff-scope.ts` are the
 * same adapter, and the two must stay behaviourally identical — a fingerprint
 * means nothing unless both producers compute it the same way. It is duplicated
 * rather than shared because there is no honest home for it yet:
 *
 * - `@ifc-lite/cli` already depends on `@ifc-lite/mcp`, so this package cannot
 *   import from there without a cycle.
 * - `@ifc-lite/diff` is deliberately store-agnostic and dependency-free; giving
 *   it a runtime dependency on `@ifc-lite/parser` to host an adapter would undo
 *   the property that lets the viewer, the CLI and this server each supply
 *   their own.
 * - `@ifc-lite/parser` must not learn about diffing. The *scope* walk is close
 *   to parser-domain — it exists to compensate for the columnar parser's own
 *   `EntityTable` gaps — but which `IfcRoot` branches a comparison may speak
 *   for is diff policy, and exporting that from the most-depended-on package
 *   under a neutral name would only rename the problem.
 *
 * That leaves a fourth package both could depend on, which is a published
 * artefact and a release decision rather than a review fix.
 *
 * Until then the agreement is **asserted, not assumed**. The copies previously
 * relied on parallel suites (`diff.test.ts` here, `diff-content.test.ts` in the
 * CLI) checking the same behaviour separately, which cannot detect a drift:
 * fixing one copy and not the other passes both. It took hours to find out —
 * #2001 moved the CLI's membership check to the cross-schema inheritance lookup
 * and this copy stayed on the IFC4 codegen pin, silently dropping every IFC2X3
 * and IFC4X3 object class outside that pin. `diff-fingerprints.test.ts` now runs
 * *both* copies over the CLI's own fixtures and requires the same entities under
 * the same type names, so the next divergence fails a build instead of shipping.
 *
 * The one thing this copy has and the CLI's does not is the optional
 * `overlay` argument. It is additive, not a divergence: a `model_id` on this
 * server names a session that may carry queued mutations, and the CLI diffs two
 * files that cannot. Called without it, the two copies compute byte-identical
 * fingerprints, which is what the paired tests check.
