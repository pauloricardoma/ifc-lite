/**
 * The MCP server's adapter onto the real `@ifc-lite/diff` engine (issue #1891).
 *
 * `model_diff` on its own answers "what changed at the type and identity
 * level" — counts per type, GlobalIds added and removed. That answer is wrong
 * in the most damaging way the moment the two models came from a from-scratch
 * re-export: every GlobalId is new, so the whole model reads as
 * deleted-and-added. `by_content: true` routes the same two loaded models
 * through the engine's content-keyed matching pass instead.
 *
 * **Data scope only, on purpose.** Node has no geometry pipeline here: no
 * meshes, so no world geometry hash and no bounding box. Rather than pretend
 * otherwise the handler passes `scope: 'data'`, which is the honest description
 * of what it can see — the engine then classifies every unambiguous 1:1 content
 * match as `renamed` and reports every genuinely ambiguous group as a group,
 * exactly as it does for a viewer session whose geometry hashing was
 * unavailable.
 *
 * **Scope of the comparison: every `IfcObjectDefinition` in the model.** IFC's
 * three `IfcRoot` branches are not equally comparable. An `IfcObjectDefinition`
 * (every `IfcObject` — product, task, actor, control, resource, group — plus
 * `IfcTypeObject` and `IfcContext`) is an independently identifiable thing. The
 * other two branches are dependent and stay out:
 *
 * - `IfcRelationship`: its identity is its endpoints. Re-GUIDing an
 *   `IfcRelAggregates` while both ends are untouched is not a change anyone
 *   wants reported.
 * - `IfcPropertyDefinition`: a property set's content is already folded into
 *   its owner's `dataHash`, so comparing it again would double-report every
 *   edited property — once on the element, once on the pset.
 *
 * Membership is decided from the inheritance chain of every bundled schema
 * (IFC2X3 + IFC4 + IFC4X3), not from whether the columnar parser happened to
 * put the entity in its `EntityTable`, and not from the IFC4 codegen pin alone.
 * That distinction is the whole fix for a class of silent drop-outs: the table
 * only holds the categories the viewer renders, so `IfcTask`, `IfcActor`,
 * `IfcWorkPlan` and every other non-product `IfcObject` reported an empty
 * GlobalId and vanished from the comparison entirely, even though their STEP
 * records carry one. Those are read straight from the source record instead.
 * (`by_entity` on the same tool still asks the store and so still misses them;
 * that is pre-existing behaviour of a different flag, untouched here.)
 *
 * The same distinction closes the drop-out's mirror image. The parser fills
 * the table's GlobalId column positionally, and for a resource entity slot 0
 * is not a GlobalId: an `IfcMaterial`, `IfcSurfaceStyle`, `IfcClassification`
 * or `IfcProjectedCRS` was compared under its *Name*, colliding keys into the
 * comparison — a material and a surface style of the same name arriving as
 * one entity. None is an `IfcRoot`, so the chain check leaves them out.
 *
 * ## Why this is a second copy, and what stops it drifting
 *
 * `packages/cli/src/commands/diff-engine.ts` and its `diff-scope.ts` are the
 * same adapter, and the two must stay behaviourally identical — a fingerprint
 * means nothing unless both producers compute it the same way. It is duplicated
 * rather than shared because there is no honest home for it yet:
 *
 * - `@ifc-lite/cli` already depends on `@ifc-lite/mcp`, so this package cannot
 *   import from there without a cycle.
 * - `@ifc-lite/diff` is deliberately store-agnostic and dependency-free; giving
 *   it a runtime dependency on `@ifc-lite/parser` to host an adapter would undo
 *   the property that lets the viewer, the CLI and this server each supply
 *   their own.
 * - `@ifc-lite/parser` must not learn about diffing. The *scope* walk is close
 *   to parser-domain — it exists to compensate for the columnar parser's own
 *   `EntityTable` gaps — but which `IfcRoot` branches a comparison may speak
 *   for is diff policy, and exporting that from the most-depended-on package
 *   under a neutral name would only rename the problem. (A fourth package both
 *   could depend on is a published artefact and a release decision, not this.)
 *
 * Until then the agreement is **asserted, not assumed**. The copies previously
 * relied on parallel suites (`diff.test.ts` here, `diff-content.test.ts` in the
 * CLI) checking the same behaviour separately, which cannot detect a drift:
 * fixing one copy and not the other passes both. It took hours to find out —
 * #2001 moved the CLI's membership check to the cross-schema inheritance lookup
 * and this copy stayed on the IFC4 codegen pin, silently dropping every IFC2X3
 * and IFC4X3 object class outside it. `diff-fingerprints.test.ts` now runs
 * *both* copies over the CLI's own fixtures, so the next divergence fails a
 * build instead of shipping.
 *
 * The one thing this copy has and the CLI's does not is the optional `overlay`
 * argument: a `model_id` here may carry queued mutations the CLI's two files
 * cannot. Called without it, the two copies compute byte-identical
 * fingerprints, which the paired tests check.

/**
 * Fingerprint one overlay-created entity (`entity_create`).
 *
 * It goes through the same `classifyType` gate as a stored entity — a created
 * `IfcRelAggregates` stays out of the comparison exactly as a parsed one does,
 * and an unrecognised class keeps the same reach the store path gives it — and
 * its `ifcType` is the registry's spelling. The caller may have authored the
 * STEP-uppercase form, and `ifcType` is hashed and cross-checked on every
 * content match, so `IFCWALL` would never pair with `IfcWall`.
 *
 * Its attributes come from the same place a stored entity's do: the creation
 * payload is only the *base*, which `entity_set_attribute` overrides exactly as
 * it overrides a parsed record (see {@link buildDataInput}). Create-then-rename
 * is an ordinary two-step, and reading the frozen payload made this the one
 * fingerprint in the model describing a value the session no longer holds — a
 * rename went unseen, a clear was hashed as the name it cleared. All four
 * hashed IfcRoot attributes: `Name` and `Description` have a payload behind them
 * (STEP slots 0/2/3 are fixed across `IfcRoot` subtypes), `ObjectType` has none
 * (slot 4 is `ApplicableOccurrence` on an `IfcTypeObject`) and so exists only as
 * an override. `Tag` is read from its class-specific authored slot or override,
 * and hashed only for `IfcTypeObject` (issue #2021). Property sets and
 * quantities are read through the overlay.
 *
 * An authored key is resolved from its effective attributes or property sets,
 * alongside source entities, so a duplicate is treated as a collision.
 *
 * `predefinedType` and `typeAssignments` are necessarily absent: both are read
 * through the store, which has no row for an entity that exists only in the
 * overlay, and neither is reachable through `entity_set_attribute`. A created
 * entity that would have matched on those alone therefore reports as added
 * rather than matched, which is the safe direction.
