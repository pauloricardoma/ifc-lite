/**
 * `model_diff`'s `by_content` half: the real `@ifc-lite/diff` engine run over
 * two loaded models (issue #1891), plus `split_merge` / `successors`
 * (issue #4956). Split out of `diff.ts` for size.
 *
 * **Data scope only.** This server has no geometry pipeline, so there is no
 * world geometry hash and no bounding box; `scope: 'data'` is the honest
 * description of what it can see, and every unambiguous 1:1 content match is
 * therefore reported as `renamed` rather than `moved`/`reshaped`. `split_merge`
 * and `successors` are geometry-only stages: they are threaded through to
 * `diffModels` so the params exist and cost nothing today, but on this server
 * they currently produce no claims either way (`diff.splitMerges` /
 * `diff.successors` stay `undefined`, the engine's abstention) — they start
 * producing claims the moment this server gains a geometry pass, with no
 * further plumbing change. See `diff-fingerprints.ts`.
