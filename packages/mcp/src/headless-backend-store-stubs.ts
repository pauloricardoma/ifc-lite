/**
 * The `bim.store` authoring surfaces MCP v0.1 deliberately does not implement:
 * cost (#4857) and structural analysis (#5167 S.1).
 * Hosted openings, doors, windows, types and materials use the shared SDK factory (#6232 D5).
 * Other agent flows author through `entity_create` with raw
 * attributes, so these throw loudly rather than silently no-opping.
 *
 * Composed into one spread so `headless-backend.ts` gains a surface, not a
 * line, each time another factory-backed store surface is added to the SDK.
