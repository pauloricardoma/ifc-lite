# @ifc-lite/mutations

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5912](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5912) [`66f3d7e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/66f3d7eb085e77a27e4a0bae096daa70b43620c9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Bulk edits and CSV imports are now one undo step each ([#5861](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5861)).
  
  The Bulk property editor and the CSV importer write straight to the model's property overlay, so neither run reached the undo history: Ctrl+Z did nothing, the model was not flagged as having unsaved changes, and cancelling a Bulk run left the chunks it had already applied in place with no way back. Both now record their run as a single undo step (one Ctrl+Z reverts the run, one Ctrl+Y re-applies it) and mark the model as changed. A cancelled Bulk run says how far it got, and undo reverts what it applied.
  
  Undo and redo of a batch no longer recurse once per change and commit the stacks in one update, so a 10,000-element batch undoes in milliseconds instead of overflowing the call stack.
  
  `ImportStats` (`@ifc-lite/mutations`) gains `mutations`, the list of mutations the import applied, so a host with an undo history can record them.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- [#5545](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5545) [`5c02af8`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/5c02af8b7fda4d2fe53f79d3f00b9d192fc664d9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **Behaviour change:** element rules now read list, enumerated and table property values member by member, in search, applicability and validation, and so in everything built on the same filter evaluator (appearance query scopes, clash set filters, chart filters). The `unit` requirement's reported value lists each member with its unit. In validation, `eq` and `ne` choose number or text comparison per member, so one text cell in a table no longer forces every number cell to a text comparison. A positive operator passes when ANY member matches. A negated operator (`ne`, `notContains`, `notMatches`) passes only when NO member has the value.
  
  Before, these rules compared the joined display string, so results change for existing list-valued properties. Against the list `Colors = (Red, Blue)`:
  - `Colors = Blue` used to fail and now passes.
  - `Colors = "Red, Blue"` used to pass and now fails.
  - `Colors != Red` used to pass and now fails.
  
  Each bound of a range is checked against the members on its own, so on a table `>= 15 AND <= 5` passes when some cell is ≥ 15 and another is ≤ 5. In search, negated operators also stop passing on a single non-matching property set when a regex set name matches several sets. That is the NONE rule validation already applied.
  
  The set checks (`unique`, `aggregate`, `compare`) still read each property as one whole value (a list's joined text, a table's `Table (N rows)` summary), so their results do not change.
  
  Bounded values and complex properties keep their display value. Lens colouring, the CLI's `--where` and bulk-edit queries are not rules and keep their own matching. Models whose properties come from a server-parsed property table carry no structure marker, so they keep the joined value.
  
  `@ifc-lite/parser` marks each extracted property with a `structure` (`enumerated`, `bounded`, `list`, `table`, `reference`, `complex`) when it is not a single value, and exports the `ExtractedProperty` type. `@ifc-lite/data`'s `Property` declares the same field, and `MutablePropertyView` keeps it on base properties. The filter value suggestions offer list members. `propertyCandidates` and `readSubjectWhole` are exported.

### Minor Changes

- [#5255](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5255) [`35b8b23`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/35b8b238821138d6c5bc94d3ad51abf832677a88) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Enumerate live IFC entities through one mutation-aware boundary in headless queries.

- [#5464](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5464) [`83284a9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/83284a947d9adb9e1ece28f9d5ee7166722be1e5) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Adding many elements into a model no longer slows down quadratically ([#5413](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5413)). Every `bim.store.add*` call, Flow `Add element` lane and UI add looked up the owner history and representation contexts by walking every entity created so far, so adding 2,000 columns took about 12 s. The effective-entity enumeration now reads a single-class query from a per-class index of created entities, and checks created-entity membership in O(1). The same 2,000 columns now take about 0.4 s, and 4,000 about the same. `MutablePropertyView` gains `getNewEntitiesOfType(type)`, and `EffectiveEntityOverlay` gains two optional members, `getNewEntity` and `getNewEntitiesOfType`. A plain-data overlay without them keeps the previous full scan.

- [#5517](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5517) [`e66c849`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e66c849b6a79de9691a1e70ee3b2b593c5327fa1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `parseValue` and `CsvConnector` now accept a Real, Integer, Boolean or Logical cell only when the whole cell is a value of that type ([#5427](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5427)). Values that were silently coerced before are now reported per cell and left unwritten: `12,5` or `60abc` in a Real column (previously written as 12 and 60), `2.7` in an Integer column (previously 2), and any word other than true/false/yes/no/1/0 in a Boolean or Logical column, such as `ja` or `UNKNOWN` (previously `false`). A property match on such a cell no longer selects entities either. `generateMutations` reports each skipped cell through its `warnings` array. Surrounding whitespace and exponent notation (`1.2E-05`) are still accepted; a decimal comma is refused rather than guessed. The flow table nodes already applied this check and now share the same function, so their behaviour is unchanged.

- [#5316](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5316) [`a250a92`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a250a928b1c8c64ac6153136772fe6c71398eee9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Allow `resolveSpatialAnchor` to read the effective entity set through an optional mutation view. In-store authoring can now target a created storey or placement and will not reuse deleted or retyped-away owner history, contexts, storeys or placements ([#5249](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5249)). CLI and viewer authoring pass their live views.
  
  `StoreEditor.getMutationView()` gives in-store helpers the same effective read context; generated spaces now resolve their anchor through it.

- [#5377](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5377) [`2dd677d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/2dd677d7307d87f3b433256bd00647a2a3ee06df) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Export `buildMatchContext`/`matchRowAgainstContext` (from `csv-match.ts`) and `parseValue`/`PARSE_INVALID` (from `csv-parse-value.ts`) so `@ifc-lite/flow-nodes`' `table.joinByKey` (issue [#5167](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5167) phase 3.2) can reuse the existing tag/property row-matching index and typed-cell parsing instead of re-implementing them.

- [#5303](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5303) [`71ace41`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/71ace41b0ccfde286fe7fc1074011a91c9c8d5b1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `StoreEditor.removeEntity()` returning `false` and deleting nothing for a property or quantity atom the parser deferred out of `entityIndex.byId` (`deferPropertyAtomIndex: true`, the canonical example in the parsing guide), even though `StoreEditor.hasEntity()` reported that entity present. Callers that ignore the returned boolean silently kept the entity. The source-index membership test is now one shared predicate, `storeHasSourceEntity(store, expressId)` (new export), used by `StoreEditor`'s `addEntity`, `removeEntity` and `hasEntity` and by the CLI and MCP headless backends, so these checks can no longer disagree about whether an entity exists.

- [#5282](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5282) [`07ed0dd`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/07ed0ddaf4e527f1fff3704cc0d36e700fcde1a7) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Allow the effective-entity iterator to enumerate a caller's source table domain, and make federated search filters include live deletions, creations, and class changes without scanning unrelated STEP records.

### Patch Changes

- [#5378](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5378) [`992f553`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/992f55304ca0ec8ed5be3b4eabab429c68808a7e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `BulkQueryEngine` now selects from the session's effective model ([#5249](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5249)). An entity created this session is a bulk-edit candidate, matched by class and by its authored GlobalId and Name. A retyped entity is selected by its new class, not its parsed one. A queued Name edit is what `namePattern` matches. Deleted entities stay excluded ([#5196](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5196)).

- [#5276](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5276) [`52d30de`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/52d30de0ae3fc8ef6322191bd1831483b93d485f) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add `iterateEffectiveEntities`, the single effective-entity enumeration for a live model session ([#5249](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5249)). Given a store's entity index and its mutation overlay, it yields every source entity except tombstoned ones and every overlay-created entity, with its effective class (retypes applied) and an `overlayCreated` flag. The overlay can be a `MutablePropertyView` or any object with the same `isDeleted`/`getNewEntities`/`getTypeMutations` shape, such as a worker snapshot. It lives in `@ifc-lite/data` so that packages which do not depend on `@ifc-lite/mutations`, such as IDS, can use it. `@ifc-lite/mutations`' `iterateEffectiveEntityIds` now delegates to it, with the same signature and results.

- [#5239](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5239) [`bd15b3f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bd15b3f607f43ab47c8f4d530ed95231f802e15c) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `BulkQueryEngine.select()` (both the entity-type fast path and the no-filter `getAllEntityIds()` path) selecting, counting, and mutating entities that were already deleted in the mutation view. The deleted entities' writes previously survived `restoreFromTombstone` (undo of the delete).

- [#5302](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5302) [`eebb00e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/eebb00e52719e0254d1626f791740ce7fe7489a9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - CSV import (`CsvConnector`) now matches rows against the session's effective model ([#5198](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5198)). Previously every match strategy (GlobalId, Express ID, Name, Tag and `property`) enumerated the base entity table. So an entity deleted this session was still matched, counted and written to, and those writes survived undo of the delete. An entity created this session could never be matched. Candidates now come from the shared effective-entity accessor: tombstoned entities are excluded, and overlay-created entities are included. A created entity matches by its authored GlobalId, Name and Tag (a queued attribute edit wins) and by its overlay property sets.

### Minor Changes

- [#5230](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5230) [`f87bed2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f87bed29a52610b66b3d0ee510406ce087a66621) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `CsvConnector` matches on `tag`, and `property` is implemented ([#5167](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5167)).
  
  The `property` strategy was previously declared but warned "not yet implemented" and matched nothing. It now resolves through the mutation overlay and considers every property set sharing a name, so an entity carrying both a type and an occurrence pset of the same name matches on either. A new `tag` strategy joins on the element `Tag`.
  
  Matching builds one index per call instead of scanning every entity per row, and reports ambiguous matches, empty match cells, and a match column missing from the CSV header.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5016](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5016) [`0100a54`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0100a544d0446d2f19b5f76f37d6dc45d31da837) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the loaded-model cost-authoring foundation: mutation-aware cost reads, effective created-record export, schema-consistent cost builders, relationship assignment, reference-safe removal, and StoreEditor entity-type/schema lookup.

- [#5015](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5015) [`6a5f3f2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6a5f3f2ae703ce170b890f85535af846251d3ab7) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `StoreEditor` seeds its overlay express-id allocator from the store's entity table as well as `entityIndex.byId`, so IFCX-origin and reconstructed collab-room stores (whose byte index is empty) no longer hand a new overlay entity an id the base model already owns ([#5008](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5008)). `MutationStoreShape` gains the optional `entities.expressId` member that carries those ids.

- [#4984](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4984) [`873a648`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/873a6481af34f1a494e9667ab1f77c3328125077) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Expose `MutablePropertyView.isPropertySetDeleted` for consumers that merge immutable property sets with mutable overlays.

Resolve named attributes across every bundled IFC schema so IFC2X3-only and IFC4X3-only classes participate too (`EntityNode.allAttributes()` now consults the store's own schema version). On-demand property extraction reports a property's explicit `Unit` as `unit` plus `unitSiScale`; an unresolvable unit reference is reported as `#<id>` with no scale instead of being dropped.

Property overlays can now delete one quantity while retaining its quantity set.

Existing synchronous transaction APIs are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#4335](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4335) [`8620be3`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8620be38be0162b7cbdbe23ae7bc924763b83612) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Guard every place a caller-supplied regex pattern is compiled and run against untrusted input, closing a ReDoS (catastrophic-backtracking) hole: an IDS document's `xs:pattern` facet (four sites — the constraint matcher, the entity-type resolver, and two schema-audit sites in `@ifc-lite/ids`) and the viewer's bulk-edit "Name Pattern (Regex)" field (`@ifc-lite/mutations`'s `BulkQueryEngine.select`).
  
  New `@ifc-lite/regex-guard` package: a single shared guard (`assertGuardedRegexPattern`, `compileGuardedRegex`, `hasCatastrophicBacktrackingShape`) rejects a pattern over 256 characters or shaped like a known catastrophic-backtracking construct (`(a+)+`, `(.*)*`, …) before it is ever compiled. `@ifc-lite/extensions`'s bundle-test runner, which already had its own copy of this exact check, now imports the shared implementation instead of carrying a second one.
  
  A rejected pattern surfaces as a visible failure, not a silent non-match: an IDS specification whose pattern is rejected reports `status: 'fail'` with an `error` message (new optional field on `IDSSpecificationResult`) instead of reading as passing or not-applicable; the schema audit reports a new `E_REGEX_UNSAFE` issue; `BulkQueryEngine.select` and the entity-type resolver throw `UnsafeRegexPatternError`.
  
  This is a heuristic, not a complete defence — see the package's doc comment for what it does not catch.

### Minor Changes

- [#3943](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3943) [`86c8c47`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/86c8c477d96845b6564562b4209bc96b1dac878b) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `createDataAccessor` (`@ifc-lite/ids/bridge`) now accepts an optional
  `propertyOverlay` resolver: `(expressId) => PropertyOverride[] | undefined`.
  When provided, `getPropertyValue` and `getPropertySets` apply the returned
  overrides (set/delete) on top of the store's own property projection before
  returning results; every other accessor method is unaffected, and omitting
  the parameter reproduces the exact previous behaviour.
  
  This lets a caller with in-memory property edits that have not yet been
  exported (e.g. the viewer applying an IDS-driven correction through its
  mutation overlay) re-run IDS validation and see those edits reflected,
  instead of only ever validating the last parsed/exported bytes.
  
  No breaking change: the new parameter is optional and every existing call
  site is unaffected.
  
  Fixes a defect in the viewer's overlay resolver (not part of this package,
  but depends on the API below): after an undo, IDS re-validation kept
  reporting a corrected property as still overridden, because the resolver
  read `MutablePropertyView.getMutationsForEntity()` — the append-only
  `mutationHistory`, which undo does not pop (it re-applies the inverse
  mutation with `skipHistory=true`). `MutablePropertyView` gains
  `getPropertyMutation(entityId, psetName, propName)`, returning the live
  overlay's current `PropertyMutation` for that key (or `undefined` when the
  key carries no override right now) — the same live-overlay source
  `hasChanges()` / `getModifiedEntityCount()` already use instead of history,
  now exposed so a caller projecting the overlay onto an external base can
  tell "no override", "override is a DELETE", and "override is a SET to
  null" apart.
  
  Also fixes a unit-frame mismatch in `resolveEffectivePropertySets`: a
  `PropertyOverride.value` is written in the model's raw storage frame
  (mirroring `MutablePropertyView.setProperty`), but every other property in
  the same pset had already been scaled to base SI by
  `projectProperty`/`applyUnitConversion`. Under a non-1.0 project length
  scale (e.g. a millimetre-authored project), a corrected value read back in
  the wrong frame — 1000x too large or too small — so an IDS re-check
  compared it against a base-SI literal as if it were already base-SI.
  Both directions now go through the same `resolveEntityMeasureScales` the
  base projection already uses: `resolveEffectivePropertySets` forward-scales
  an override's raw value into base SI before splicing it in, and
  `IDSCorrectionDialog.tsx` inverse-scales the user's base-SI input into the
  model's raw frame before writing. This covers a correction to a property
  that already exists in the pset (keyed off the existing entry's own
  `dataType`) AND one that creates a brand-new property (a PROPERTY_MISSING
  requirement): `PropertyOverride` gains an optional `dataType`, threaded
  from the dialog's own write-time dataType resolution through
  `MutablePropertyView.setProperty`'s new optional `dataType` parameter (also
  stored on `PropertyMutation`) so the "no existing entry" branch has
  something to scale by too, instead of splicing the raw value in unscaled.
  Non-measure dataTypes (labels, booleans, identifiers) pass through
  unscaled in both directions and for both cases.
  
  Also fixes a case-sensitivity mismatch in `resolveEffectivePropertySets`
  (the overlay merge behind `createDataAccessor`'s `propertyOverlay`
  parameter above): `getPropertyValue`/`getPropertySets` already match
  pset/property names case-insensitively (to tolerate real-world IFC files
  whose Pset/property names don't match the canonical casing), but the
  overlay merge matched exact-case only. When an override's target name
  differed only in case from the entity's actual (non-conformant) base
  property name, the merge appended the override as a SEPARATE,
  differently-cased property instead of replacing the existing one — and
  the case-insensitive read then returned the untouched base entry first,
  since it comes earlier in iteration order. A correction could read back
  as applied (its own write-then-verify check reads the exact key it just
  wrote) yet stay permanently invisible to a re-run of IDS validation
  through this same accessor. The merge now matches case-insensitively too,
  consistent with the read path it feeds.

### Major Changes

- [#3456](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3456) [`793fce2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/793fce217039f11d6b74f898daed03f48c33809d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `CsvConnector.generateMutations` silently wrote `0` for a Real/Integer property whenever the source CSV cell wasn't a number at all (`"N/A"`, `"TBD"`, a blank cell after a bad delimiter split, ...). `parseFloat(value) || 0` and `parseInt(value, 10) || 0` both coerce `NaN` to `0`, so an unparseable cell produced a mutation indistinguishable from a genuinely-imported zero, applied to the model with no error and no warning.
  
  `parseValue` now returns a private sentinel for a Real/Integer cell that fails to parse, and `generateMutations` skips that cell instead of writing the fabricated `0` — matching how the sibling Express-ID match strategy already handles an unparseable numeric column (`isNaN` guard, warning, no phantom match). `generateMutations` also takes an optional `warnings` array to report which cells were skipped and why; `import()` and `importAsync()` now pass their own `stats.warnings` through it, so a CSV import surfaces the skip instead of hiding it.
  
  A genuinely-zero cell (`"0"`) still writes `0` as before — only cells that don't parse as a number at all are skipped.
  
  A `List` cell is handled the same way. The branch used to choose between the two accepted encodings by catching a `JSON.parse` throw, so a malformed JSON list fell through to the semicolon path and `[1,2` was imported as the one-element array `['[1,2']`, the same fabricated value the sentinel exists to prevent. The encoding is now resolved in three steps: a valid JSON *array* wins, a semicolon marks the other form, and only a cell that starts with `[`, carries no semicolon, and still will not parse is skipped and reported. Valid JSON that is not an array (`5`, `{"a":1}`) is not a list, so it takes the semicolon path and becomes a one-element list exactly as it did before. Semicolon-separated lists are unaffected, including ones whose entries are bracketed (`[EXT];[LOAD]`).

### Patch Changes

- [#3468](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3468) [`586fa29`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/586fa292b69cdb3ba6e45764b4ff742b2fa7b9a9) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix queries, filters, and CSV/JSON exports that silently dropped or omitted data when an entity carried two property (or quantity) sets with the same name -- e.g. one from the type definition and one from the occurrence, which is valid IFC.
  
  Affected symptoms, now fixed:
  - MCP and CLI entity queries with a property filter (`query_entities`, `ifc-lite query --where`) could wrongly exclude a matching entity from the results, with no indication anything was omitted, when the filtered property lived ONLY on the entity's second same-named property set. (When both sets carry it, the filter still reads the first one's value -- see the closing paragraph.)
  - CSV/JSON export with a `Pset.Property` or `Qto.Quantity` column could emit an empty cell instead of the real value, for the same reason.
  - The viewer's advanced-filter query could likewise drop a matching entity from the result count/highlight.
  - `ifc-lite query`'s `--sort`, `--group-by` and `--unique` on a `Pset.Property` path, and `ifc-lite export`'s dotted columns, read only the first same-named set and so sorted, grouped, or exported a blank where a value existed.
  - Editing a quantity whose base value lived on a second same-named quantity set recorded the wrong "old value" and the wrong create-vs-update classification, which undo relied on.
  - Deleting a property or quantity set that the entity carried twice under the same name removed only the first one's members: the panel showed the whole set gone while the exported file still carried the second one's properties.
  
  All of these now scan every same-named set, not just the first, before deciding a property or quantity is absent.
  
  Which member they then use is still first-match, and that is the remaining gap: when two same-named sets both carry the property, only the first one's value is read. Emitting one cell wants exactly that, but a filter does not -- `ifc-lite query --where Pset_WallCommon.FireRating=REI60` still drops a wall whose first `Pset_WallCommon` says `REI30` and whose second says `REI60`. That behaviour predates this change and is tracked in [#3490](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3490).

- [#3539](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3539) [`19f1312`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/19f13120a05cd3a3b729eeaf5550cff71b7506d9) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `MutablePropertyView.setProperty`/`deleteProperty` and `setQuantity` mutating an existing property or quantity on EVERY base property/quantity set sharing a name, instead of only the first one that carries it. An entity that carries two same-named psets or qsets (a type set and an occurrence set, say) both holding a `FireRating` property or a `Width` quantity now has edits and deletes land on the first same-named instance only, matching the first-match-wins semantics `getPropertyValue`/`PropertyTable.getProperty` already use for reads. `getForEntity`/`getQuantitiesForEntity` are the single source of truth the STEP exporter reads from, so no separate export-side fix was needed.

- [#3614](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3614) [`82c77c1`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/82c77c118d5a4be8e5ee5b7f7e0648514e9fb74e) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `MutablePropertyView.exportMutations()` no longer lets a non-finite quantity value (`NaN`/`Infinity`/`-Infinity`) collapse to `0` across `importMutations()`. `JSON.stringify` maps a non-finite number to `null`, and the quantity replay path (`applyMutations`) did `Number(mutation.newValue)`, where `Number(null)` is `0` — so a serialize→deserialize round trip silently changed the value, even though applying the same mutations directly (no serialization in between) preserved it exactly. `exportMutations`/`importMutations` now wrap a non-finite `newValue`/`oldValue`/whole-set member `value` in a JSON-safe marker and restore it on import; an ordinary finite value is unaffected, and a string property value is never mistaken for the marker.

- [#3855](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3855) [`182215a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/182215a835c4beac6a776bcb4eb1d019cab9063e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Corrected the code samples on each package's npm landing page: the README fences are now typechecked against the package's real exports, so the snippets import what they call, declare the values they read, and no longer show removed options or renamed methods. Patch-bumping every package whose README changed so the corrections actually reach npmjs.com.

- [#3538](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3538) [`dc8198c`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/dc8198ce3f9b9be4b2420dce90343822e0079465) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `MutablePropertyView.getForEntity` and `MutablePropertyView.getQuantitiesForEntity` no longer copy a property or quantity onto every base set that shares its `name`. Traced from the viewer's bSDD "jump to added property" highlight ([#1107](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1107)): an entity can carry two distinct `IfcPropertySet`s — or two `IfcElementQuantity`s — with the same `Name`, and `setProperty`/`setQuantity` record the mutation under a key that stops at that name, so both views replayed the one mutation once per same-named instance. Two shapes followed, and both are fixed on both paths. A property or quantity that no same-named instance carried was written into all of them — a genuine duplicate in the output the properties panel renders and the STEP exporter writes back into the file, not just a display ambiguity; it now goes to the first same-named instance and nowhere else. One that a same-named instance already carried is an edit, not an addition: it is applied in place wherever it already sits, and the phantom copy that used to be stamped onto the first instance as well is gone, so a value no longer appears on a set that never had it. `packages/mutations/test/mutable-property-view.duplicate-pset.test.ts` pins both shapes on both paths; a companion viewer test (`PropertySetCard.same-name-focus.test.tsx`) confirms the existing highlight logic then lands on exactly the mutated set. `getEffectiveChanges`'s change list is not part of this fix: for an edit to a property only the second same-named set carries, it still reports two rows.

A `MutationGuard` type is exported for the callback shape. Callers that do not pass `canEdit` see no behaviour change.

### Patch Changes

- [#3032](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3032) [`487866d`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/487866dac131bf50a0b3008ddce5db933768dca2) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `MutablePropertyView.setProperty()` misclassifying the first edit of an already-present-but-null base property (an unset Boolean parsed from the source IFC file, the same shape as issue [#1107](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1107)) as `CREATE_PROPERTY` instead of `UPDATE_PROPERTY`.
  
  `propExistedBefore` relied on `oldValue !== null` plus an in-session `newPsets` check, but neither test covers a property that exists in the *base* property table with a null value: `getPropertyValue()` legitimately returns null for it before any edit. `deleteProperty()` already avoids this trap with its own `propExistsInBase` lookup against the base pset's property list; `setProperty()` now checks the same thing, so the mutation is correctly classified as an update — keeping the exported mutation type consistent for any consumer that treats CREATE vs UPDATE differently (e.g. an undo that should restore the prior unset state rather than deleting the property outright).
  
  The base-pset lookup only counts a row that is still visible: a property the user has already deleted — directly, or by deleting its whole pset — is masked out of `getForEntity()`, so re-setting it stays a `CREATE_PROPERTY`. Otherwise undoing that re-set would replay `oldValue: null` and bring the deleted property back as a present-but-unset row instead of removing it.

  `sites?: number[]` was declared on `SelectionCriteria` ("Filter by site IDs")
  and `SpatialHierarchy.bySite` was populated to serve it, but `select()` had no
  branch reading `criteria.sites` — unlike its `storeys`, `buildings` and
  `spaces` siblings, which each filter candidates through their matching
  `SpatialHierarchy` map. A caller who scoped a bulk `SET_PROPERTY`,
  `DELETE_PROPERTY`, or `SET_ENTITY_TYPE` to one site got the whole model
  mutated instead, with no error.
  
  The new `sites` branch is structurally identical to `storeys` / `buildings` /
  `spaces`: same guard (`criteria.sites.length > 0 && this.spatialHierarchy`),
  same per-ID lookup through `bySite.get(id)` skipping unknown IDs, same
  intersection semantics when combined with other criteria. An empty `sites`
  array is treated as no filter, matching the existing sibling behavior.
  
  Known, separately-tracked gaps left unfixed (both already self-documented as
  incomplete, so not a silent bug like the one above): `applyAction`'s
  `SET_ATTRIBUTE` case returns `null` unconditionally ("would need to be
  implemented"), and `CsvConnector.matchRow`'s `'property'` strategy warns
  "not yet implemented" and matches nothing.

  It was missing, which is why `deletedQsets` was read by `getQuantitiesForEntity`, `hasPendingChanges` and `collectSetLevelChanges` while nothing populated it outside the restore path. Without it, a writer that REPLACES an entity's quantity set can shrink it but never empty it: re-running with nothing left to write leaves the previous run's numbers standing. [#2508](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2508)'s zone write-back hits that directly, where it produces a file stating cubic metres beside a property saying the volume could not be computed.

  It records its own `DELETE_QUANTITY_SET` mutation type rather than a `DELETE_QUANTITY` with no property name: both replay consumers (`applyMutations` and `change-set-to-ops`) key the member-delete case off the property name, so a whole-set removal filed under it matched nothing, resurrected the set on import and vanished from a layer publish without reaching `skipped`.

  Semantics follow `deletePropertySet`: an in-session quantity set is dropped along with the per-quantity mutations its creation recorded, and a DELETE marker is recorded only against a set that genuinely exists in the base file, so a create-then-delete in one session nets to no reported change.

  Paired with it, `MutablePropertyView.isQuantitySetDeleted(entityId, qsetName)`: `getQuantitiesForEntity` reports a deleted set and a never-existing one identically, and the STEP exporter needs the difference. It withholds a source `IfcElementQuantity` when it is writing a replacement for it, and a deletion has no replacement to be recognised by, so without this a set the session deleted was still in the exported bytes.

### Minor Changes

- [#2496](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2496) [`97ed6ef`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/97ed6ef3addb81de2bba175882be35760eb25bc9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Two ways a re-export wrote wrong data into the file a user keeps: a regenerated property set re-declared its neighbours' types ([#2482](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2482)), and a source `IfcElementQuantity` was deleted with nothing written in its place ([#2487](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2487)).

  **A regenerated property keeps the type its source line declared.** Editing one property regenerates the whole property set, so every other property in it is re-serialized too — and they were written from `PropertyValueType` alone, which is a shape and not a type. The extractor collapses `IFCLABEL` / `IFCTEXT` / `IFCIDENTIFIER` to `String` and every `…MEASURE` / `…RATIO` to `Real`, keeping the source token only in `Property.dataType`, which the generator never read. So one edit rewrote its untouched neighbours: `IFCTEXT('…')` and `IFCIDENTIFIER('A-01')` came back as `IFCLABEL`, and `IFCLENGTHMEASURE(2500.)` and `IFCAREAMEASURE(12.5)` came back as `IFCREAL` — on the numeric side the measure token IS the unit semantics, so the number stopped saying what it measures. A re-export that touches a property set now writes each property's own declared type back, under four gates: the token must name a member of the `IfcValue` SELECT (resolved from the schema registry, so all 106 IFC4 leaves qualify and a vendor token like `IFCACMEWIDGETCODE` does not — it falls back to `IFCLABEL`, lossy but valid, rather than putting a non-member in the slot); its EXPRESS base must agree with the effective value type (so a session that retyped the property with `setProperty(…, valueType)` wins, and a property nobody edited always agrees, since the extractor derived both from the same token); the value must be representable in that base (so an `IfcPropertyBoundedValue`'s measure `dataType` is not wrapped around the display string it is extracted as, and no `IFCLENGTHMEASURE(NaN)` is written where the old path wrote `$`); and the value must satisfy the declared type's own EXPRESS domain, since six `IfcValue` members are constrained defined types and `setProperty` performs no schema validation. Editing an `IFCPOSITIVELENGTHMEASURE(5.)` to `-1`, or an `IFCNORMALISEDRATIOMEASURE(0.5)` to `2`, therefore no longer re-declares the constrained type over a value that violates it; the property relaxes to the nearest unconstrained ancestor of the same measure family (`IFCLENGTHMEASURE(-1.)`, `IFCRATIOMEASURE(2.)`), which is schema-valid and still says what the number measures. Properties AUTHORED in the session are unaffected — they carry no `dataType` and are written from the type they were created with, exactly as before. `null` values are untouched too: a null is the extractor's reading of `IFCLOGICAL(.U.)` as much as of an absent value, and which it is belongs to the mapping table ([#2472](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2472)), not here.

  **A quantity edit no longer deletes the source quantity set.** A full export withheld a source `IfcElementQuantity` — the container, its quantity atoms and the `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` attaching it — whenever the session's mutation history merely NAMED that set, and then regenerated it from `getQuantitiesForEntity`. Those two disagree whenever the overlay has no base under it, and it has none by default: properties fall back to the view's `baseTable` or its on-demand extractor, but base quantities have only `setQuantityExtractor`, which is opt-in with no diagnostic when it is missing. Two reachable shapes followed. Editing one quantity of a source set regenerated that set holding ONLY the edited quantity, and the siblings the file came with were withheld and never rewritten. Undoing a quantity creation (`setQuantity` then `removeQuantityMutation`, which is what Ctrl+Z runs) left the append-only `CREATE_QUANTITY` record still naming the set while the overlay had dropped it, so the source lines were withheld and nothing at all replaced them: the export of a file WITH the quantity set was byte-identical to an export of the file WITHOUT it, under `modifiedEntityCount: 1` and no warning. Fixed in two independent places. The exporter now supplies the missing base itself — it is handed the very store the view is an overlay on, so it installs a store-backed quantity extractor when, and only when, the view has none, which covers every caller including external embedders of the published API rather than the in-tree callers we happened to find. And the skip loop now withholds a source quantity set only when the generator actually wrote a replacement for that name, rather than on the strength of a name in the history; there is no quantity-set REMOVAL this could suppress, because `deletedQsets` has no public populator, so withholding without a replacement was always the bug. A view that resolves its own quantities (the viewer, MCP, the CLI headless backend) is untouched — its extractor is never overwritten, whether it was installed before the first export or after one, and both view methods are feature-probed so a partial or older view falls back instead of throwing mid-export.

  What a re-export now produces, precisely. A property set the session edited: every property that came from the file keeps its source `NominalValue` token instead of the shape-derived one, so the same file re-exported through an edited pset differs from before on those lines and only on those lines (a property with a vendor or unrecognized token, a bounded/enumerated/list/table property, and every authored property are byte-identical to before). A quantity set the session edited: the emitted `IfcElementQuantity` now carries the source set's other quantities alongside the edited one, where it used to carry the edited one alone; an edit that was undone leaves the quantity set in the file, either as the untouched source lines or as a regenerated set with the same values and fresh express ids and GlobalId, where the whole set used to disappear. Counts are unchanged in shape: an edit that regenerates a set still counts as one modification of its host.

  `MutablePropertyView` gains `hasQuantityBase()` (minor), which is how a consumer holding the base data tells "this entity has no quantities" apart from "this view cannot see them". `packages/cli`'s `mutate`, `gym` and `generate-spaces` now wire `setQuantityExtractor` alongside the property extractor they already wired, so their views report quantity sets whole and not only at export time.

### Patch Changes

- [#2317](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2317) [`710fd83`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/710fd83638b51b2e4744a1ac364827a27dc0fc73) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `MutablePropertyView.setQuantity()` reporting a wrong `oldValue`/mutation type on the first edit of an already-existing base quantity.

  Before this fix, `oldValue` was resolved only from a prior overlay mutation for the same key (`this.quantityMutations.get(key)?.value`), never from the base quantity's own value — unlike `setProperty()`, which resolves `oldValue` via `getPropertyValue()` (overlay-or-base). So editing a base quantity for the first time produced `{ type: 'UPDATE_QUANTITY', oldValue: null }` even though a real prior value existed. Consumers that gate reverting a quantity edit on `oldValue` being non-null (e.g. `apps/viewer`'s undo handler) silently did nothing on undo — the same "reports success, reverts nothing" shape as [#2297](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2297), but for quantities, and in `@ifc-lite/mutations` rather than `@ifc-lite/mcp`.

  A second, related defect: adding a _new_ quantity name to an already-existing quantity set was classified as `UPDATE_QUANTITY` (since `qsetExistsInBase` was checked instead of the specific quantity), so undo of that create also tried to restore a nonexistent prior value instead of removing the mutation.

  `setQuantity()` now resolves `oldValue`/the CREATE-vs-UPDATE classification from the overlay mutation when present, falling back to the specific base quantity's value (existence keyed on quantity name, not just qset name) — mirroring `setProperty()`'s existing resolution order.

  The whole-qset `CREATE_QUANTITY` branch (added in [#2263](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2263) for the non-empty case) looped over `newValue` to populate the published component's `values`, but never first materialized the component the way the sibling `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` branch does. An empty `newValue` array meant the loop ran zero times, so the component was never added to the fold at all — the mutation matched the `CREATE_QUANTITY` case (so it never reached the `default` branch that records unrepresentable mutations either), and the set vanished from the published layer with `ops: []` and `skipped: []`: no diagnostic, no trace. Same failure shape as [#2263](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2263), in the one corner (empty array) that fix's test coverage didn't reach.

- [#2263](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2263) [`35e37ac`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/35e37ac99ab444773bfec669cfc5cf3937443942) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix silent data loss for whole-property-set and whole-quantity-set creations (`StoreEditor.addPropertySet` / `addQuantitySet`, or the underlying `MutablePropertyView.createPropertySet` / `createQuantitySet`) in two downstream consumers of `Mutation` records.

  `createPropertySet()` and `createQuantitySet()` each record a single `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` / `CREATE_QUANTITY` mutation for the whole set, carrying the full member array on `newValue` — unlike `setProperty()` / `setQuantity()`, which always record `psetName` **and** `propName` together for one member at a time.

  - `changeSetToOps()` (the layer-publish bridge in `change-set-to-ops.ts`) treated `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` as "materialize an empty component; members follow" — but for this whole-set form nothing else in the change set ever populated the values, so the published op carried `values: {}` and every property the user entered was dropped from the layer. The `CREATE_QUANTITY`/`UPDATE_QUANTITY` case required `propName`, so the whole-set form matched the case and produced nothing at all — not even a `skipped` entry, so the loss was invisible.
  - `MutablePropertyView.applyMutations()` (backing `exportMutations()` → `importMutations()`) had the same `psetName && propName` gap for `CREATE_QUANTITY`, so a `createQuantitySet()` batch silently vanished on round trip through a fresh view.

  Both paths now read the member array off `newValue` for the whole-set form, mirroring the per-member fold. No change to the per-member (`setProperty`/`setQuantity`) mutation shapes.

### Patch Changes

- [#2109](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2109) [`4c739be`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/4c739be2aba74ad6868b6dca51dad441c6fa9903) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Document that `MutablePropertyView.importMutations()` is not a full inverse of `exportMutations()` for overlay-created entities ([#2044](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2044)).

  A `CREATE_ENTITY` record only carries the expressId in the mutation history, not the entity's type and attributes, so `importMutations()` cannot rebuild the entity from the record alone — it logs a `console.warn` and skips the record, dropping every other mutation recorded against that same id in the same batch too. This behaviour was already correct (fixed in [#2045](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2045)), but was undocumented on the public surface: neither the package README nor the `exportMutations`/`importMutations` JSDoc (which reaches the published `.d.ts`) said so. Both now state the asymmetry plainly and point at `restoreNewEntity()` as the companion path a caller must use to carry a created entity across before calling `importMutations()`. No runtime behaviour changes.

- [#2045](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2045) [`f493930`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f4939309aed136979bd5cc1f95a25c2a0ebe779f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Stop `importMutations` from orphaning property/attribute/quantity edits under a created entity it skipped ([#2044](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2044)).

  `applyMutations` deliberately skips `CREATE_ENTITY` records — the history alone doesn't carry the type+attributes payload, so callers must restore it via `restoreNewEntity()` — but it still replayed every property, attribute, quantity, and positional-attribute mutation recorded against that entity's expressId. The receiving view ended up with a property set (or attribute/quantity/type edit) keyed to an id that existed in neither the source buffer nor `newEntities` — surfaced by `getForEntity()` and counted as a pending change by `hasChanges()` / `hasPendingChanges()`.

  `applyMutations` now skips every mutation recorded against an id whose `CREATE_ENTITY` it skipped in the same batch _and_ which nothing else supplied. Both halves matter: keying off the skip set rather than "id absent from `newEntities`" leaves replay against a normal, pre-existing source-buffer entity unaffected, and requiring the id to be absent from `newEntities` keeps the documented recovery flow — `restoreNewEntity()` first, then `importMutations()` — from having its own edits dropped as orphans. The round trip for an overlay-created entity is now lossy (the entity and its edits are both dropped) instead of corrupting (edits surviving without their entity). The `console.warn` now also states that dependent mutations were dropped.

  `applyMutations` also now builds that skip set in a dedicated first pass over the whole input array before applying anything, instead of populating it incrementally as the main loop reaches each `CREATE_ENTITY`. `exportMutations()` always produces an append-ordered array, so this wasn't reachable through any current caller, but `applyMutations`/`importMutations` are documented to accept an arbitrary `Mutation[]` (e.g. an imported change set). Under the old single-pass logic, a dependent mutation appearing before its own `CREATE_ENTITY` in such an array would see an empty skip set and replay anyway — the same orphaning bug, reached via ordering instead of the original bug shape. The two-pass version is order-independent.

### Minor Changes

- [#1967](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1967) [`14b8e45`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/14b8e45b2d4aa6c2490f6e7263d8f84731ea812e) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `MutablePropertyView.getModifiedEntityCount()` and `hasChanges()` to read the live overlay instead of the append-only `mutationHistory` (issue [#1915](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1915)). Undo does not pop `mutationHistory` — it either re-applies the inverse or clears the overlay entry directly — so after an undo, `getModifiedEntityCount()` could over-report entities that no longer have any pending change, disagreeing with `hasPendingChanges()`. Both methods now agree with `hasPendingChanges()` in every case, including entities restored via `restoreNewEntity` (which never touches `mutationHistory` at all).

  Add `getEffectiveChanges()`, returning every change the overlay currently carries — attribute, property, quantity, pset/qset add-or-delete, retype, and entity create/delete — with `previousValue` derived from the base data (property table / on-demand extractor / the new optional `AttributeExtractor`, set via `setAttributeExtractor()`), never from `mutationHistory`, so an undo→redo cycle reports the true original value instead of a stale history entry. For a tombstoned entity, only its `entity-deleted` row is reported — any attribute/property/quantity/retype edits made before the delete are dropped, matching the STEP exporter's own behavior of skipping those mutations for a deleted entity. Backs the export-review dialog in `@ifc-lite/viewer`, which lets a user see what an "Export Changes" click will actually apply before committing to it.

  Fix `deleteEntity` to purge, rather than leave orphaned, a forgotten-created entity's property/quantity/attribute/type overlay entries, its `newPsets`/`newQsets` entries, and its own `mutationHistory` records. Previously only the export-review enumeration filtered these out; `StepExporter` itself still read them directly (`getMutations()`, `getForEntity()`, `getQuantitiesForEntity()`), so a create → edit → delete entity could leave a dangling `IFCPROPERTYSET` / `IFCRELDEFINESBYPROPERTIES` in the exported file pointing at an expressId that was never actually created, invisible to the review dialog. The purged data is stashed internally and restored by `restoreNewEntity`, so undo of the delete brings back the rows, the modified-entity count, and what the exporter would see — not just the bare entity record.

  Fix two related overlay leaks that kept `getModifiedEntityCount()` disagreeing with `getEffectiveChanges()`: deleting the last property of an auto-created (in-session-only) property set left an empty, still-truthy `Map` in `newPsets` (and the equivalent for `newQsets`/quantities); and deleting an in-session-only property left a `DELETE` tombstone marker in `propertyMutations` that had no base value to mask. `collectModifiedEntityIds()` is now derived directly from `getEffectiveChanges()` instead of a second hand-rolled walk over the overlay maps, so the two structurally cannot diverge again.

  Fix `getEffectiveChanges()` to drop no-op rows: undoing an edit re-applies the inverse and lands the overlay back at the base value, so `previousValue === newValue` — previously still reported as a change (e.g. `Status: Original -> Original`) even though the user had undone it.

  Add `EffectiveChange.deleted`, set on a `'property' | 'quantity'` row only when the overlay entry is a genuine DELETE operation. Previously a row's `newValue` alone was the only signal callers had for "this will be removed on export" — but a SET whose stored value is `null` (an unset Boolean added from bSDD, issue [#1107](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1107), which is present-but-empty, not absent) stringifies to `undefined` too, the same as a DELETE's `newValue`. The export-review dialog in `@ifc-lite/viewer` now renders that distinction: a SET-to-null value reads as empty, not as a row export will drop.

  Fix `deletePropertySet` for a property set that only ever existed in-session (created via `createPropertySet`, never present in the base file): deleting it no longer records a `deletedPsets` entry, so `getEffectiveChanges()`/the review dialog no longer report a `pset-deleted` row — and `hasPendingChanges()`/`hasChanges()` no longer stay dirty — for an add-then-remove that nets to no change at all. Same reasoning `deleteProperty` already applied one level down: a purely in-session entry has nothing in the base data to mask, so there is nothing to report as deleted. Also clears the now-orphaned per-property `SET` mutations the in-session pset's `createPropertySet` call recorded, and applies the same empty-map cleanup to `newPsets` that `deleteProperty` already had (an empty `Map` is still truthy). A property set that genuinely exists in the base file is unaffected and still reports `pset-deleted` as before.

  Fix `restoreNewEntity` reordering `mutationHistory` for a create → edit → delete → restore sequence on an overlay-created entity. `deleteEntity` purges the entity's history via `stashAndPurgeEntityOverlay` before pushing its own `DELETE_ENTITY` record, and `unstashEntityOverlay` was re-appending the stashed `CREATE_ENTITY`/`CREATE_PROPERTY` records at the tail of `mutationHistory` — behind that `DELETE_ENTITY`, instead of restoring create-before-delete order. That defeated `applyMutations()`'s `skippedCreateIds` guard (issue [#2036](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2036)) on replay: the `DELETE_ENTITY` was processed before the `CREATE_ENTITY` it should pair with, so it tombstoned an id `skippedCreateIds` hadn't seen yet. The practical effect was silent data loss through the public `exportMutations()` → `importMutations()` round trip — an entity that was only ever created, edited, and (transiently) deleted-then-restored in the same session came back as a bare tombstone (`isDeleted() === true`) instead of untouched, and repeated undo/redo cycles piled up additional stale tombstones ahead of the create. `unstashEntityOverlay` now drops the superseded `DELETE_ENTITY` instead of re-appending behind it — the create and the delete cancel, the same reasoning already applied to `forgottenCreatedEntities` in the effective-changes filter one layer down. A tombstoned _source_ entity restored via `restoreFromTombstone` is a separate code path and is unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- [#2050](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2050) [`d9abe5b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d9abe5b48eee9066ff1b21d7408350f152c9f4f1) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Drop component ops for entities whose final change-set state is `tombstone-entity` ([#2048](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2048)).

  `changeSetToOps` folds `entityOps` (last-write-wins per entity) and `components` (per componentKey) in the same pass over the mutation list, but previously emitted every accumulated component op regardless of whether the entity ended up deleted. A `CREATE_PROPERTY` mutation followed later by `DELETE_ENTITY` for the same entity produced both a `tombstone-entity` op and a `set-component` op carrying the now-meaningless property values — which `apps/viewer`'s `buildDeltaNodes` merged onto the same `IfcxNode`, publishing live property values alongside `IFCLITE_ATTR.DELETED: true`.

  Component ops are now filtered against each entity's final `entityOps` state after both passes complete (not during the fold, since an entity's terminal state — LWW — is only known once the whole mutation list has been consumed). An entity tombstoned and then recreated in the same change set keeps its components, since `entityOps` resolves to `add-entity` for that identity.

## 1.23.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2036](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2036) [`a8e58a2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a8e58a2b5e75db8388835c77b2688240667f68ab) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `deleteEntity` now tombstones an overlay-created entity as well as forgetting it ([#2012](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2012)).

  It used to only remove the entity from the new-entity list, which made `isDeleted()` answer `false` for something that no longer exists. Every consumer that asks "was this deleted" therefore got the wrong answer about a created-then-deleted entity, and could only work around it by asking a different question instead — which is what `StepExporter` does on main today, and what its comment says it is doing.

  The entity is still dropped from `getNewEntities()`, so something created and deleted in one session is emitted nowhere. `restoreNewEntity` lifts the tombstone, so undo of a delete is still a complete inverse.

  `getTombstones()` now names created-and-deleted ids as well as source ones. A consumer that counts entities must intersect it with the store's own index rather than subtracting its size, or a created-then-deleted entity is subtracted twice.

  `StepExporter` reconstructed attribute values by replaying `MutablePropertyView.getMutations()` — the append-only mutation history. Undo applies its reverse edit with `skipHistory: true`, so a superseded `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` record keeps its stale `newValue` forever and the exporter baked the pre-undo value into the output. The editor showed the reverted value; the file did not. Silent, with no error and nothing in the output signalling it, and directional: it restored data the user had explicitly reverted.

  The exporter now reads attribute values from the overlay via the new `MutablePropertyView.getAttributeMutationsByEntity()`, which returns the current state — an undone edit has had its overlay entry reset to the pre-edit value, or removed outright when the attribute was newly set. This makes attributes consistent with every other overlay-backed path in the exporter: property sets (`getForEntity`), quantities (`getQuantitiesForEntity`), positional attributes (`getPositionalMutationsForEntity`) and retypes (`getEntityTypeMutation`) already read current state, so attributes were the sole outlier rather than an instance of a general pattern.

  **Scope.** Only the attribute path was affected. Property and quantity edits take their _values_ from the overlay and use the history only to decide which pset names to re-emit, so an undone property edit was already re-emitted with its correct current value. Georeferencing edits reach the exporter through `ExportOptions.georefMutations`, not through the view, and are untouched.

  `getAttributeMutationsByEntity()` and the existing `getAttributeMutationsForEntity()` are both backed by a new entityId-keyed secondary index, mirroring the one already used for property and quantity mutations. That also removes a full-map `startsWith` scan from the per-entity accessor, which the properties panel calls on every selection.

  No migration: the overlay and the history are both in-process state, and any edit that was not undone exports exactly as before.

  `setPositionalAttribute`, `addEntity`, and the in-store builders' own emitted
  geometry now consult the schema registry, so an integral value in a REAL-backed
  slot (`IfcLengthMeasure` coordinates, profile dimensions, extrusion depth, …)
  exports as `450.` rather than a bare `450` INTEGER literal that strict
  validators (`ifcopenshell.validate`) reject. Integer-typed slots are left
  untouched; the `{ real }` marker still works for genuinely ambiguous selects.
  Positional names resolve across the schema union so IFC4X3-only alignment/civil
  entities are covered too. Exposes `getAttributeNamesAcrossSchemas` from

  `IFCBOOLEAN(.T.)` / `IFCLENGTHMEASURE(3.)` rather than a bare `.T.` / `3` that
  strict validators reject and that loses the member type on round-trip. The
  exporter auto-qualifies unambiguous slots from the schema registry with no
  caller change; a new write-only `{ typed: { type, value } }` marker on
  `IfcAttributeValue` pins the type for ambiguous selects and the `IfcValue`
  family (`NominalValue`, quantity values) and subsumes `{ real }`. Completes the
  `setPositionalAttribute` / `addEntity` follow-up to [#1839](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1839).

Also exported: `applySimplifiedGeometry` and the supporting types.

  `@ifc-lite/geometry` gains `GeometryProcessor.simplifyMeshes()` backed by the new wasm `simplifyMeshes` API (`SimplifiedMeshes`). `@ifc-lite/cli` gains `ifc-lite simplify <file.ifc> --level 1..5 [--ids ...] --out light.ifc [--json]` for dev/testing. `@ifc-lite/data` / `@ifc-lite/mutations` widen `IfcAttributeValue` with a write-only `{ real: number }` marker (serialized by `stepReal()` in `@ifc-lite/export`) so tessellation coordinates always carry a decimal point.

  - `@ifc-lite/data`: `Property` gains an optional `dataType?: string` carrying the raw IFC measure value type (e.g. `"IFCVOLUMETRICFLOWRATEMEASURE"`) of a typed nominal value. Additive and optional; existing consumers are unaffected.
  - `@ifc-lite/mutations`: the `PropertyExtractor` function type now carries the same optional `dataType?` per property, and `MutablePropertyView.getForEntity` preserves it through the base and mutation-merge paths, so a property's measure type survives the merge for unit display.
  - `@ifc-lite/mcp`: `geometry_volume` / `geometry_area` now resolve the volume/area symbol from the file's declared `IfcUnitAssignment` (via `@ifc-lite/parser`'s `extractProjectUnits`) instead of hardcoding `m³` / `m²`, and report the resolved symbol in a new `unit` response field. Falls back to the SI default when the store has no source buffer or declares no such unit.

No API change: the method is still called `import`.

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1407](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1407) [`6af9dc2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6af9dc26f97f87237c27ae502c127e6170a80d64) Thanks [@Blogbotana](https://github.com/Blogbotana)! - Apply pending edits in merged (federated) export. `MergeModelInput` gains an optional
  `mutationView`; `MergedExporter.exportAsync` now bakes each model's edits (attribute /
  property / quantity / retype / positional mutations and overlay-created entities) into its
  source via `StepExporter` before merging, so federated export round-trips edits exactly like
  single-model export. Previously the merged path read raw source bytes and silently dropped
  every mutation — only single-model export reflected edits ([#1406](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1406)).

  Models without pending edits pass through unchanged (no export/parse cost). The synchronous
  `MergedExporter.export()` throws if a model carries pending edits, since baking needs the
  async parser. The viewer's "Merged (All Models)" export now passes each model's mutation view
  (gated by the Apply Mutations toggle).

  `MutablePropertyView` gains `hasPendingChanges()`, which reports the current overlay footprint
  (what the exporter would bake) rather than the append-only mutation history; the merged
  exporter uses it to decide whether to re-bake a model.

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1234](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1234) [`b6acbc4`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b6acbc4b84bcdb4a2d774515200d27edd7e831cb) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add entity retype (reassign class) to the mutation overlay.

  `EntityTable` gains an additive `setTypeOverride(expressId, typeName | null)` so
  a host (the viewer) can reflect a pending retype live in `getTypeName` /
  `getTypeEnum` without rebuilding the table; the original columnar type is left
  intact.

  `StoreEditor.setEntityType(expressId, newType, { predefinedType? })` and
  `MutablePropertyView.setEntityType(...)` change an entity's IFC class in place,
  and a new `BulkAction { type: 'SET_ENTITY_TYPE', entityType, predefinedType? }`
  applies it to a selection. `StepExporter` materializes the retype on export.

  The entity keeps its expressId, so geometry, placement, representation and every
  `IfcRel*` reference (all keyed by `#id`) carry over unchanged. Attributes are
  re-laid-out by name against the target class's declared layout — dropping
  attributes the target lacks (e.g. IFC2X3 `CompositionType`) and validating
  `PredefinedType` against the target enum (an unknown override falls back to
  `USERDEFINED` + `ObjectType`). This mirrors IfcOpenShell's
  `ifcopenshell.util.schema.reassign_class`. Intended for compatible
  reassignments such as the building-element subtypes that share the IfcElement
  layout (`IfcBuildingElementProxy` ↔ `IfcColumn`/`IfcBeam`/`IfcMember`/
  `IfcPlate`/`IfcWall`).

A property may legitimately exist with no value (e.g. an IFC boolean added from bSDD, which now starts unset rather than defaulting to `false`), so `MutablePropertyView` no longer reads `value === null` as "property does not exist":

  - `deleteProperty` keys absence off existence (in-session pset membership), so an unset property is still deletable instead of the trash button being a silent no-op.
  - `setProperty` classifies a write as `UPDATE_PROPERTY` vs `CREATE_PROPERTY` by whether the property already existed (not by null value), so undoing an edit to an unset property restores its prior unset state instead of deleting the whole property.

  On huge files the parser defers high-cardinality property atoms out of `byId` into `deferredEntityIndex` (`deferPropertyAtomIndex`). `StoreEditor.computeMaxExistingId()` scanned only `byId`, so a deferred atom sitting above the primary-index maximum could have its express id reused for a newly created overlay entity. With the export fix now emitting deferred atoms, that collision would surface as two `#ID=` definitions in the STEP output. The watermark (and the post-construction "store grew" guard) now span `deferredEntityIndex` too. Surfaced in review of the [#1110](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1110) export fix.

  declared `import` + `types`, so any resolver hitting the CJS/default
  condition path (tsx, jest, plain `require`, some bundlers) failed with
  ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED. The `default` entry points at the same

### Patch Changes

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces — diagnostics, broader wall coverage, and a sweep of
  review feedback.

  **Auto Spaces detection.** The "no enclosed regions detected"
  failure mode now surfaces actionable counts — both in devtools
  and in the panel itself.

  - `extract-walls.ts` now tries the standard `Axis` representation
    (`IfcShapeRepresentation` with `RepresentationIdentifier='Axis'`,
    `IfcPolyline` items) **before** falling back to the
    `addWallToStore` rectangle-profile convention. That covers
    walls authored by Revit / ArchiCAD / IfcOpenShell — the previous
    extractor only handled walls placed via the Add Element tool.
    The placement chain is read once and the polyline endpoints are
    transformed through it, so rotated walls work.
  - Every wall that gets dropped is recorded with a typed reason
    (`no-axis-or-rect-profile`, `placement-not-resolvable`,
    `zero-length-axis`, …) — the panel summarises them as
    `"3× no-axis-or-rect-profile, 1× zero-length-axis"`.
  - `detectEnclosedAreas` exposes a
    `detectEnclosedAreasWithStats(...)` companion that returns
    per-stage counts (vertices, edges-after-split, faces total,
    outer / below-min-area drops, largest area). The intersection
    splitter's iteration cap now scales with input size
    (`max(100, segments * 10)`) so dense floor plans don't bail
    out early.
  - `generateSpacesFromWalls` always logs a `console.info`
    one-liner and threads a new `debug?: boolean` flag down to the
    extractor + detector for verbose tracing. The viewer's Auto
    Spaces panel exposes a "Verbose console logging" checkbox.
  - The Auto Spaces diagnostic block now shows the graph stats
    (`123v / 456e / 78f`), the drop counts, and per-reason wall
    skips. Two amber hints fire automatically when walls were
    extracted but no faces formed (likely snap tolerance), or
    when nothing extracted (likely an unsupported geometry shape).

  **Review-feedback sweep (PR #598).**

  - `addElementMeshes.linearBox()` and the SVG `linearBoxCorners`
    helper honour each endpoint's Y so a sloped beam previews as
    a sloped prism instead of being flattened to the start.
  - `bridge-store.requireStoreyId` rejects `0` (EXPRESS ids are
    1-based, `#0` is never valid).
  - `addWindow` / `addDoor` `tsParamTypes` include
    `UserDefinedPartitioningType` / `UserDefinedOperationType`
    so typed sandbox callers can hit the IFC4 round-trip without
    casts.
  - `AnnotationLayer.resolveEntityType` no longer falls back to
    `ifcDataStore` when the annotation's `modelId` is missing
    from a federated `models` map (would resolve the wrong
    entity in multi-model sessions). Single-model sessions keep
    the fallback.
  - `addDoorToStore` / `addWindowToStore` validate
    `OperationType` / `PartitioningType` against the IFC4 enum
    and re-route unknown values through
    `.USERDEFINED.` + `User-defined…Type` so custom labels
    round-trip cleanly.
  - `addWallToStore` defaults `PredefinedType` to `.NOTDEFINED.`
    (was `.STANDARD.`) to match the rest of the in-store
    builders.
  - `duplicateInStore` / `resolveDuplicateSource` allow
    `OwnerHistory` to be `null` (IFC4 made it optional). The
    duplicate emits a bare `$` token instead of `#null` for the
    omitted case.
  - `StoreEditor.addEntity` accepts an injected schema-aware
    normalizer (`setEntityTypeNormalizer`); `@ifc-lite/sdk`
    registers `normalizeIfcTypeName` + `isKnownType` at load
    time so direct callers — CLI scripts, sandbox bridge,
    unit tests — see registry-grade rejection of typos like
    `IfcWal`, plus canonical PascalCase on `EntityRef.type`.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Duplicate-from-selection — pick any IfcRoot product, hit `⌘D` (or
  right-click → Duplicate), get a fully-functional clone. The
  duplicate is a first-class entity in the property panel, exports
  cleanly to STEP with all its property associations preserved, and
  ships in 6 directional variants sized to the source's bounding box.

  **`@ifc-lite/create`**

  - New `duplicateInStore(editor, source, options)` pure builder.
    Emits a fresh placement chain (`IfcCartesianPoint` →
    `IfcAxis2Placement3D` → `IfcLocalPlacement`) plus the duplicate
    `IfcRoot` with a new GUID and the source's `Representation`
    reference reused (geometry shared). Optional fresh
    `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` anchors to the source's
    storey. Offset is configurable via `options.offset` — the slice
    sizes it to the source's bbox.
  - New `resolveDuplicateSource(store, expressId)` walks the parsed
    `IfcDataStore` for placement / parent / location / storey /
    associations.
  - New `SourceAssociation` shape captures one
    `IfcRelDefines*` / `IfcRelAssociates*` edge that references
    the source. The builder replays each one against the duplicate
    so the exported STEP carries identical psets / qsets /
    materials / classifications / documents / type binding —
    without modifying any existing rel.
  - Resolver scans the five association rel types
    (`IFCRELDEFINESBYPROPERTIES`, `IFCRELDEFINESBYTYPE`,
    `IFCRELASSOCIATESMATERIAL`, `…CLASSIFICATION`, `…DOCUMENT`)
    by direct numeric membership in `RelatedObjects`.
  - `DuplicateBuildResult.associationRelIds: number[]` exposes the
    fresh rel ids for caller introspection.
  - 7 unit tests in `duplicate.test.ts`: full graph emission,
    custom offset, no-storey path, root-placement parent, attribute
    count guard, association replay (3 rel types in one go), and
    the no-associations case.

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`**

  - New `setEntityAlias(overlayId, sourceId | null)` /
    `getEntityAlias(id)` / `resolveBaseEntityId(id)` public surface
    on `MutablePropertyView`. Aliases redirect base property and
    quantity reads from the duplicate to its source — so the
    duplicate inherits psets/qsets without eagerly cloning them
    into the overlay.
  - Override slots stay scoped to the original (overlay) id, so
    edits on the duplicate don't bleed into the source. Verified
    by 4 new unit tests including the source-untouched path,
    chain-cap (one hop, not transitive), and the self-alias guard.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`**

  - New `duplicateEntity(modelId, sourceExpressId, direction?)`
    slice action. Wraps the create-package builder, sets the
    mutation-view alias, and clones the source's mesh data into
    the geometry result with the offset applied — so the duplicate
    appears in 3D the moment the action fires, not just in the
    export overlay. Per-vertex `entityIds` arrays are filled with
    the new globalId so picking and selection resolve correctly.
  - New `DuplicateDirection` type (`+X` / `-X` / `+Y` / `-Y` /
    `+Z` / `-Z`). Magnitude per axis = the source's bounding-box
    dimension on that axis, so a 3m wall steps 3m and a 0.4m
    column steps 0.4m. Falls back to a 1m step when the source
    has no mesh in geometry.
  - Right-click menu's "Duplicate" item is now a `DuplicateRow`:
    primary clickable label on the left (defaults to +X), 6 axis
    chips on the right (→ ← ↗ ↙ ↑ ↓). Tooltips spell out
    "+X (east)" through "−Z (down)".
  - `⌘D` defaults to +X. `⇧⌘D` = +Z (up), `⌥⌘D` = +Y (north) —
    modifier shortcuts for power users without forcing a mouse
    trip to the chip row. Selection moves to the new globalId so
    a Cmd+D chain ("stamp a row of columns") works without
    re-clicking.
  - **`resolveGlobalIdFromModels` two-pass overlay fallback** —
    the federation resolver previously gated each model's id range
    at parse-time `maxExpressId`, which excluded every
    overlay-allocated id from selection. The fix: a second pass
    consults each model's mutation view via `getNewEntity(localId)`
    so overlay duplicates resolve to the right model with the
    right local id. Without this, the property panel saw the
    duplicate as "UNKNOWN / Unknown / no property sets" because
    the alias couldn't take effect on a wrongly-resolved id.
  - PropertiesPanel falls back to the overlay `NewEntity` record
    for type / name / GUID / Description / ObjectType when the
    parsed `entityNode` comes up empty. The bSDD attribute list
    synthesises from the schema-defined positional names. The
    Materials / Classifications / Documents / structural
    Relationships sections all route through a new
    `lookupExpressId` (alias-resolved) so they query the source's
    parsed maps directly.

  After: a freshly-duplicated wall is genuinely first-class — name
  reads, properties show, quantities show, material layers show,
  classifications show, documents show, and a round-tripped STEP
  file carries every association.

- [#461](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/461) [`6ce40dd`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/6ce40ddb0cace5f83c2438d2d4c4bd47703468f7) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Clean up package build health for georeferencing work by fixing parser generation issues, making export tests resolve workspace packages reliably, removing build scripts that masked TypeScript failures, tightening workspace test/build scripts, productizing CLI LOD generation, centralizing IFC GUID utilities in encoding, and adding mutation test coverage for property editing flows.

## 1.14.3

### Patch Changes

- [#330](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/330) [`07851b2`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/07851b2161b4cfcaa2dfc1b0f31a6fcc2db99e45) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Remove the unused `@ifc-lite/parser` runtime dependency from `@ifc-lite/mutations`, switch `@ifc-lite/server-bin` postinstall to a safe ESM dynamic import, and refresh the published `@ifc-lite/wasm` bindings and binary so the npm package stays in sync with the current Rust sources.
