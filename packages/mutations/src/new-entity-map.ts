 *
 * Effective enumeration asks "the created entities of class X" once per query,
 * and the in-store builders query per element they add. Answering by scanning
 * every created entity made a bulk add O(n²); the index makes it O(matches).
 * Each class bucket preserves creation order, like the map itself. The one
 * divergence, re-setting an existing id under a DIFFERENT class, moves it to
 * the end of its new bucket; no writer does that.
