/**
 * Host-promise delivery for bridge methods (#2305).
 *
 * A schema method whose `call` returns a Promise — `bim.clash.run` and
 * `bim.clash.matrix` are the ones that do — could not be delivered to the
 * script at all before this module existed. `marshalValue` walked the Promise
 * as an ordinary object, found no own enumerable properties, and handed the
 * script `{}`; the real work carried on unobserved on the host and, when it
 * failed, rejected with nobody listening. That is what #2305 is: a script
 * passing a `ClashElement` without its `tag` made the engine throw
 * `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toUpperCase')` as an
 * *unhandled host rejection*, uncaught, killing the page's script run — while
 * the sandbox's own `try/catch` around `method.call` saw nothing, because a
 * throw inside an `async` function is a rejected promise, not a throw.
 *
 * The fix is to make the host promise a real promise inside the realm:
 * `vm.newPromise()` hands the script something it can `await`, and the host
 * settles it. Rejections then travel the sandbox's existing error channel —
 * the same `bim.<ns>.<method>: <message>` text the synchronous path throws,
 * catchable by the script and surfaced as a `ScriptError` when it is not
 * caught (`Sandbox.runEval` already renders a rejected result promise that
 * way). No second channel is introduced.
 *
 * QuickJS knows nothing about the host's microtask queue, so a deferred that
 * has been settled only propagates to the script's `.then` callbacks once
 * `executePendingJobs()` runs again. `HostWorkQueue` is what lets
 * `Sandbox.runEval` wait for the host side and re-drain the guest side, and
 * what lets `dispose()` free any deferred that never settled — an unfreed
 * resolver handle is exactly the orphan that makes `runtime.dispose()` abort
 * the whole WASM module (#1905).
 *
 * The queue also owns the *cancellation* of that work (#2419). Bounding the
 * wait is not the same as bounding the work: a `bim.clash.run` that outlived
 * its run's deadline kept intersecting geometry to completion in the
 * background, for a result discarded the moment it arrived. The signal below
 * is handed to every bridge call and aborted when the run stops waiting or the
 * sandbox is torn down.
