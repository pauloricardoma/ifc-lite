 * - Every `bim.*` call crosses the WASM boundary to the host
 * - Entity objects in the sandbox are plain data { ref, name, type, ... }
 * - Property/quantity access triggers on-demand extraction on the host
 *
 * All namespaces (model, query, viewer, mutate, lens, export) are built
 * from declarative schemas in bridge-schema.ts.
