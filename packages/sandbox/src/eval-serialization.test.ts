/**
 * `Sandbox.eval` serializes per sandbox (#2110).
 *
 * The bridge's capture state — the `logs` array, the byte total and the
 * `truncated` flag — is created once per *sandbox* in `buildBridge` and closed
 * over by the console functions, so it is shared by every run. `eval()` clears
 * it at the start of each run. Two overlapping `eval()` calls therefore fought
 * over one buffer: the second call's reset wiped state the first was still
 * filling, and entries produced by one run surfaced in the other's
 * `ScriptResult.logs`.
 *
 * Overlap is reachable because `eval()` awaits the TypeScript transpile before
 * touching the VM, which yields to the microtask queue with the reset already
 * applied. The fix queues each run behind the previous one on a per-sandbox
 * promise chain, so capture state is only ever owned by one run at a time.
