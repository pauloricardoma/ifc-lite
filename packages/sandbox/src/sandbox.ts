 * Sandbox — QuickJS-in-WASM script execution environment.

 * Architecture:
 * - One WASM module loaded per app lifetime (shared across sandboxes), retired
 *   and replaced if a teardown abort poisons it (see quickjs-module.ts, #1922)
 * - Each sandbox creates a fresh QuickJS context (cheap — a few KB)
 * - The `bim` API is built inside the context via bridge.ts
 * - Scripts run synchronously inside QuickJS
 * - Memory and CPU limits enforced per-context
 * - TypeScript is transpiled to JS before execution (type-stripping)

/**
 * Thrown by `Sandbox.dispose()` when upstream QuickJS aborts while freeing the
 * runtime (#1922).
 *
 * A failure raised inside a *drained promise job* — the reported case is an
 * out-of-memory in the post-`await` body of an `async function run()` — leaves
 * objects orphaned on `rt->gc_obj_list` with leaked refcounts. `JS_FreeRuntime`
 * asserts that list is empty, so teardown comes back as
 * `Aborted(Assertion failed: list_empty(&rt->gc_obj_list))` — long after the
 * `eval()` that caused it resolved normally, with a message that says nothing
 * about which script did it or what to do next.
 *
 * This class does not fix that; it names it. The following were each measured
 * against the issue's reproducer in a **fresh process per trial** — the
 * isolation matters, because emscripten latches `ABORT` per module instance
 * and every trial after the first on one module reports a false clean:
 *
 * - forcing a QuickJS collection before teardown, by allocating 256 through
 *   1,000,000 object literals in the realm: still aborts. The orphaned objects
 *   have leaked refcounts, so the collector cannot reach them.
 * - the same with the memory limit lifted first, and with large retained-then-
 *   dropped allocations to push past the collector's threshold: still aborts.
 * - draining the job queue repeatedly, creating and freeing a second context,
 *   and skipping `context.dispose()`: all still abort.
 *
 * quickjs-emscripten 0.32 exposes no GC entry point, so *preventing* the abort
 * has no in-repo lever. Surviving it does: the aborted module is retired and
 * the next sandbox is built on a fresh instance, so this error means "the
 * script that just ran is over", not "scripting is over until a page reload"
 * (see quickjs-module.ts).
