- [#2539](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2539) [`cd72412`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/cd724127245fcb767894642cd0994baaba88ff7d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Forward a geometry/parser worker's wasm panic-location stash to the main thread.

  A follow-up to the wasm-trap source-location attribution: the Rust panic hook stashes
  `{ location, at }` on whichever realm's JS global it runs in, but a panic inside a geometry
  process worker or the parser worker left that stash stranded in the worker's own realm, invisible
  to the main thread's `attachWasmPanicLocation` gate — so "Geometry worker error: unreachable" (and
  the equivalent parser-worker error) still arrived without a location.

  Both workers now read + consume their own realm's stash on the `{type:'error'}` message they post
  back, and the main-thread pools (`geometry-parallel.ts`'s process-worker pool AND its streaming
  pre-pass worker, `worker-parser.ts`) re-plant it on the main realm's global before the load error
  propagates — so the existing consume-once, TTL-guarded attachment gate in the viewer picks a worker
  trap up exactly as it would a main-thread one. The re-plant only happens when the accompanying error
  message itself looks wasm-trap-shaped, so a stash forwarded alongside an ordinary, non-trap worker
  error (the worker always forwards whatever it has, regardless of the error that triggered it) can't
  sit on the main realm's global and mislabel an unrelated later trap. Location only, never the panic
  message, matching the existing privacy contract.

### Patch Changes

- [#2359](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2359) [`7ee619f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7ee619f8c6a7490982136d5677674f4f6355a568) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix two corrupted cells in the generated CRC32 lookup table (index 111 and 245), which were hand-typed literals that had silently drifted from the correct reflected CRC-32 (polynomial `0xEDB88320`) values. `packages/codegen` now renders this table from a single `buildCRC32Table()` source of truth in both its TypeScript and Rust templates instead of hand-typing a second copy, so the two cannot diverge again.

  The 256-entry `TYPE_IDS` map shipped for every named entity in the schema was never affected — those ids are computed with the correct table at generation time. The corruption only affected `crc32Hash()` / `crc32_hash()` at runtime for entity keywords that are NOT in the map, i.e. the `IfcType::from_str` `Unknown(crc32_hash(...))` fallback reached for unrecognized/vendor-extension entity keywords, which could get a silently wrong stable id for names whose hash computation happened to touch one of the two corrupted cells.

  `packages/codegen/generated/ifc4/type-ids.ts`, `packages/parser/src/generated/type-ids.ts`, `rust/core/src/generated/schema.rs`, and `packages/codegen/generated/ifc4x3/type-ids.ts` were all regenerated to correct the same two cells; each diff is exactly those two constants. The `ifc4x3` copy (see the companion changeset) is not imported by `packages/parser` or `rust/core`, so it had no runtime reader today, but it is a checked-in generated artifact and now matches the canonical table like the other three.

  `formatCRC32TableLiteral()` now validates `perLine` and throws for a zero, negative, or non-integer value instead of silently producing a broken or extremely slow result. No caller passes a non-default `perLine` today, so this is a hardening of the exported helper's contract rather than a behavioral fix to generated output — with the default (`perLine = 6`), this hardening by itself leaves the four regenerated artifacts above unchanged.

- [#2542](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2542) [`1de1696`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/1de16969db1c56f4901e4af49da74085bae3b3fe) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Skip `/* */` comments when scanning for entities, so a commented-out record stays commented out

  The entity scanners looked for `#` anywhere in the buffer, including inside a
  STEP comment. A record that has been commented out is still a well-formed
  `#id = TYPE(...);`, so every shape check downstream accepted it and it was
  parsed as a live entity. Round-tripped through `StepExporter`, those revived
  records are written into the output as real ones, taking express ids from gaps
  in the source numbering.

  The guard added in [#856](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/856) cannot catch this. It requires a `#<digits>` to be
  followed by `=`, which rejects a bare `[#1](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1)` in prose and accepts a commented-out
  record, because that record has its `=`. The comment has to be skipped as a
  region, which is what the Rust `EntityScanner` already does.

  All three copies of the scan loop are fixed, not just the one: `scanEntities`,
  `scanEntitiesFast`, and the string-embedded `WORKER_CODE` in
  `scan-worker-inline.ts`. The worker matters most, because `scanIfcEntities`
  tries it before the wasm scan and before the tokenizer, so in a browser it is
  the copy that runs. Each skips comment regions, counts the newlines it jumps so
  line numbers stay right, stops at an unterminated comment rather than resuming
  inside it, and leaves a lone `/` alone. Comments do not nest, per ISO 10303-21,
  so the first `*/` closes the region.

  The scanners now also consume a string literal whole when they meet one outside
  a record. HEADER records carry no `#`, so the outer loops walk them byte by
  byte, and their string values are the one place those loops reliably meet
  quoted text. A `FILE_DESCRIPTION` reading `'rev /* pending'` would otherwise
  open a comment that never closes and drop the entire DATA section of a legal
  file. The same skip fixes a defect that predates this change: `[#12](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/12)=IFCWALL(x)`
  inside a HEADER description was read as a record.

  `scanEntities` additionally now advances past a record it has matched. It used
  to leave its cursor at the record's opening parenthesis and re-walk the body
  with no string state, which was harmless while an interior `#` merely failed
  the `=` guard and would not have been once the same loop began reacting to
  `/*`: a slash-star inside a string literal would have opened a comment and
  swallowed the rest of the file. The Rust scanner advances for the same reason.

### Patch Changes

- [#2497](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2497) [`7c686f9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7c686f9ac39f78a707dc083c798b6ef3d255e171) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `parseStepValue` decodes ISO 10303-21 backslash directives, and the decoder that does it now lives in one place ([#2490](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2490)).

  **What changes for a caller.** `@ifc-lite/data`'s `parseStepValue` un-doubled the two lexical doublings (`''` and `\\`) with a directive-blind pair of regexes and stopped there, so a string literal taken from a real IFC file came back with its directives intact: `'\X2\00FC\X0\'` returned those nine characters where the shared decoder returns `ü`, and `'\X2\00FC\X0\\'` returned `\X2\00FC\X0\` where it should return `ü\`. `\X\HH`, `\S\x` and `\Px\` were equally untouched, and the same gap applied inside a list, since `parseStepList` recurses through the same function. All of those now decode. Values written by this module's own escaper are unaffected — it emits non-ASCII raw and never emits a directive, so every `\\` it produces really is a doubled reverse solidus and the round trip was, and remains, exact. That is why this was invisible from inside the package: the reader was the exact inverse of the writer, and only a literal from somewhere else could tell them apart. `parseStepValue` is a public export, so that is a supported way to reach it.

  **Why the escaper does not move with it.** The pair is still closed. Emitting non-ASCII raw stays valid against the new reader — there are no backslashes to double and nothing to decode — and the directive-precedence rule in the shared scan is what keeps a value that merely LOOKS like a directive round-tripping as literal text: `\X2\00FC\X0\` written out as `\\X2\\00FC\\X0\\` reads back as those characters rather than decoding to `ü`. Switching the writer to emit `\X2\` directives would also round-trip, and is a separate decision about output bytes rather than a correctness fix.

  **One decoder instead of two.** The implementation is now `decodeStepStringLiteral`, exported from `@ifc-lite/encoding` (the additive API, hence the minor there). `packages/parser/src/source-header.ts` had written the same scan privately in [#2486](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2486) after its own directive-blind regex corrupted non-ASCII header fields on round trip; that copy is deleted and both readers call the shared one. Its behaviour is unchanged — the code moved verbatim — so header parsing is byte-for-byte what it was. Two independent copies of a decoder this subtle is exactly how the second directive-blind regex survived, and the resolution is genuinely not two passes: a doubling pass run first eats a directive's own terminator whenever an escaped backslash follows it (`\X2\00FC\X0\` + `\\` ends in three backslashes), leaving an unterminated `\X2\` that never decodes.

  **A new dependency edge, `@ifc-lite/data` -> `@ifc-lite/encoding`.** It is acyclic — `@ifc-lite/encoding` has no dependencies of its own and imports nothing from `@ifc-lite/data` — and free in practice: every package that consumes `@ifc-lite/data` (parser, export, sdk, bcf, create, lists) already installs `@ifc-lite/encoding`. Released as a patch for `@ifc-lite/data`: no exported API changes, and the behavioural difference is a decode that was missing.

### Major Changes

- [#2339](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2339) [`de7bd04`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/de7bd04619a43a32900b188e0507b95e7542d8c8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **Breaking:** `IfcDataStore.source` is now an `IfcSourceBytes` accessor instead of a `Uint8Array` ([#2183](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2183)).

  On a 342 MB model the source is 327 MB of the ~671 MB the viewer's main thread holds, and it is resident for the model's whole lifetime because property and attribute reads slice it synchronously during render. The contract "here are all the bytes, contiguous, forever" is what blocks any cheaper representation; the accessor replaces it with "ask for the range you need", which makes every whole-file consumer an explicit `materialize()` call you can see and count.

  This release is behaviour-neutral: the only implementation shipped is the contiguous one, whose `slice` is a `subarray`. STEP export is byte-identical across the default, header-fallback, `visibleOnly`, merged and merged-`visibleOnly` paths (verified against a 44,249-entity model, both new reads mutation-checked). The compressed block-backed implementation lands behind the same interface.

  **Migrating.** Most guards need no change: `byteLength`, `length` and truthiness behave exactly as they did, so the existing `!store.source?.length` shape still compiles and still means the same thing.

  - Reading a range — `store.source.slice(a, b)` and `new TextDecoder().decode(...)` become `store.source.decodeUtf8(a, b)`. `slice` still returns a view.
  - Needing the whole file — `store.source.withMaterialized(bytes => ...)` (or `withMaterializedAsync`), which scopes the buffer so it cannot outlive the call. `materialize()` exists for the cases where scoping is impractical.
  - Constructing a store — wrap with `contiguousSourceBytes(bytes)`, or `EMPTY_SOURCE_BYTES` for stores with no source (server-parsed, synthetic, GLB, point cloud). Helpers that must accept both shapes can normalise with `asSourceBytes`.
  - `parseSourceHeader` now accepts either shape and reads only the first 64 KiB, so exporters no longer materialise a whole file to read its header.
  - `fromTransport` passes an `IfcSourceBytes` argument straight through rather than re-wrapping it. Hydrating several stores from one source (the streaming parser's partial + final pair) should share one accessor, so the memoised `contentKey` is computed once.
  - `toTransferable()` no longer forces the `contentKey` hash. Describing a source for a worker is meant to be cheap; computing the key there would walk the whole file on the sending thread. It now carries the key only when something has already computed it, and `sourceBytesFromTransferable` reads a `null` key as "not computed yet" so the receiver hashes lazily to the same value.

  New exports from `@ifc-lite/parser`: `contiguousSourceBytes`, `EMPTY_SOURCE_BYTES`, `isSourceBytes`, `sourceBytesFromTransferable`, and the `IfcSourceTransfer` type. (`toTransferable` is on the public interface, so its inverse belongs in the same surface -- otherwise a consumer can produce a transfer envelope with no supported way to rehydrate one.) (`asSourceBytes` and the `IfcSourceBytes` type were already exported by the widening step above.)

  `isSourceBytes` is exported because a store built behind an `as unknown as` cast cannot be type-checked on this field, so the contract has to be assertable at runtime -- which is how a producer that kept handing over a raw `Uint8Array` was found.

Used by the viewer's model-level info panel to show all classification systems used in a model, not just the first.

- [#2353](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2353) [`958aef1`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/958aef125743682da75c3da7b41991abd9d36d32) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add block-compressed storage for `IfcDataStore.source`, and let a source switch to it in place ([#2183](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2183)).

  Inert in this release: nothing constructs a compressed source yet. It is the machinery plus its proofs, landing separately from the switch that turns it on so the switch can be reverted on its own.

  The source is the whole IFC file, held resident for the model's lifetime because property and attribute reads slice it synchronously during React render. On a 342 MB model that is 327 MB of the viewer's main-thread heap. Deflating it into fixed-size blocks and inflating on demand trades that for ~67 MB plus a small cache.

  Sized from measurement rather than taste, using fflate on the real 342.7 MB model:

  | block      | stored    | saved      | inflate p50 / p99 / max   |
  | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
  | 16 KiB     | 77 MB     | 265 MB     | 0.08 / 0.25 / 1.70 ms     |
  | **64 KiB** | **67 MB** | **275 MB** | **0.18 / 0.35 / 0.40 ms** |
  | 256 KiB    | 64 MB     | 278 MB     | 0.69 / 0.93 / 1.32 ms     |

  64 KiB: 256 KiB buys 3 MB more for 3.8x the per-miss latency and a much worse tail, which is the wrong trade for a synchronous read on the render path.

  The cache is 32 MB. A full per-entity sweep touches 5161 of 5229 blocks — essentially each block once, because expressId order tracks byte offset in STEP — so it is a sequential scan, not a thrash, and capacity is nearly irrelevant to it (32 MB and 256 MB are within 7%). Capacity is therefore sized for the interactive working set, where the worst measured case (a 1000-product selection) touches 500 blocks.

  **The swap is in place, and that is load-bearing rather than stylistic.** `attachDataStoreAccessors` captures the accessor in a `BufferEntitySource` held for the store's lifetime, so `getEntity` reads through that object, while `getProperties` builds a fresh extractor from `store.source` on every call. Replacing the property instead of mutating the object would leave entities served from the old resident buffer and properties from the compressed one — both alive, nothing saved, and the two read paths silently disagreeing.

  Fixed here for the same reason: `parseColumnar` built **two** accessors over the same bytes, one for `source` and one inside `BufferEntitySource`. Harmless while both are resident views; fatal once the source can compress, because the entity path would keep its own resident accessor and the original buffer would never be released. Measured both ways — with two accessors the buffer survives GC after a swap, with one it is collected.

  New exports: `compressSource`, `compressSourceInPlace`, `shouldCompressSource`, `sourceBlockStats`, `COMPRESSION_MIN_BYTES`, `DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_CACHE_BYTES`, and the `CompressedSource`, `BlockedPayload`, `BlockStoreCounters` types. `sourceBytesFromTransferable` now rehydrates the `blocked` arm, so a source crosses a worker boundary as ~67 MB of blocks instead of 343 MB of bytes, with no inflation on either side.

  Adds `fflate` as a dependency of `@ifc-lite/parser`; it was already a viewer dependency.

Behaviour-neutral groundwork: every widened helper normalises through `asSourceBytes` and reads via `decodeUtf8`/`slice`, and no call site changes shape. (`IfcDataStore.source` still held a `Uint8Array` at this step; the type flip lands in the same release, below.)

  `@ifc-lite/parser` now exports `asSourceBytes` and the `IfcSourceBytes` type. They were internal in the previous step because nothing outside the package consumed them; the widened readers in `@ifc-lite/export`, `@ifc-lite/cli` and the viewer are that consumer, and `IfcDataStore.source` is on its way to the type regardless.

  Widened: `BufferEntitySource`, `extractLengthUnitScale`, `extractProjectUnits`, `SpatialHierarchyBuilder.build`, `buildEntityRefsFromIndex`, `collectReferencedEntityIds`, `collectStyleEntities`, `collectRefsInByteRange`, and the CLI's dangling-reference scan.

  The function has always returned `1.0` for two different situations that look identical to every caller: a file that genuinely declares meters, and a file whose unit declaration could not be resolved at all (no `IfcProject`, no `UnitsInContext`, a malformed `IfcUnitAssignment`, an unrecognised SI prefix, or no length unit present in the assignment). Only 2 of the 11 `return 1.0` paths warned before this change; the other 9 returned the same plausible-looking value silently, so a model authored in millimetres with a broken unit declaration read as metres with no signal that the value was a guess — a 1000x scale error indistinguishable from a valid file.

  8 of those silent paths now call a warning helper before returning `1.0`; a 9th (an `IfcSIUnit` with no prefix, which is a genuine, confirmed "this file declares meters", not an unknown) intentionally still does not warn. The warning is latched per `entityIndex` (i.e. per parsed model) rather than per call, so callers that re-derive the scale many times for the same store — `extractWallSegmentsForStorey` runs once per storey, `resolveSpatialAnchor` once per generated space — do not flood the console with repeats of the same diagnosis; a different model still gets its own warning.

  No signature or return-value change: `extractLengthUnitScale` still returns a `number`, and every existing caller's fallback-to-`1.0` behaviour is unchanged. This is the "make it visible" remedy, not the "let each caller decide" remedy — the function has 15+ call sites and the large majority (geometry/coordinate scaling: `columnar-parser.ts`, `extract-walls.ts`, `resolve-anchor.ts`, `resolve-source.ts`, `kmz-export.ts`, `lod0-generator.ts`, `demesh-session.ts`, `useIfcCache.ts`, `length-unit-scale.ts`, `effective-georef.ts`) need a plain number to keep scaling coordinates and have no sensible operation to refuse on `null`; a `null`-returning signature change was evaluated and rejected as a placebo for those call sites specifically because they'd all just coalesce it back to `1` immediately. The handful of read/reporting call sites (the MCP `units` tool, the viewer's unit-metadata panels) could act on a distinguishable "unknown", and can still choose to key off the `console.warn` if closer coupling turns out to be worth it later.

### Minor Changes

- [#1963](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1963) [`d008604`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d0086043fa88f488d19942ffe9241d80bab4be6a) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `IfcLagTime` exporting a lead time (a negative lag) with the wrong sign. When a sequence carried a negative `timeLagSeconds` and no `timeLagDuration`, the serializer's fallback reconstructed an `IfcLagTime` from the magnitude alone — so a 2-day lead (the successor may start 2 days _before_ its predecessor finishes) exported as a 2-day lag, and a consumer reading the file would schedule the successor 2 days _late_ instead of early: a 4-day swing, silently.

  The fix: `secondsToIso8601Duration` and `parseIso8601Duration` now form a signed codec (both exported from `@ifc-lite/parser`, consolidated out of two previously-separate implementations). A negative `timeLagSeconds` encodes to the ISO 8601-2 signed form (`-P2D`) instead of either losing its sign or being dropped, and the decoder reads that sign back on import, so a lead round-trips through `ifc-lite` losslessly: `-172800` seconds → `-P2D` → `-172800` seconds.

  **Interop caveat, accepted deliberately:** strict ISO 8601 durations have no sign. `-P2D` is ISO 8601-2, which `IfcDuration`'s unconstrained `STRING` type accepts, but some third-party `^P...` IfcDuration parsers reject the leading `-` outright and will drop the lag rather than read it. That is judged the better failure mode than the alternative this replaces (silently exporting the wrong sign) or dropping the lag from every export including our own re-imports — a lead is real scheduling information, and losing it in our own round trip is a worse defect than a third-party parser occasionally rejecting the field. If a consumer's `IfcDuration` parser needs unsigned durations, it will surface as that consumer failing to read the lag, not as a wrong schedule.

  Reachable from the construction-schedule importer, where a CSV predecessor such as `1FS-2 days` yields a negative lag.

  **Also fixed in the same codec:** `secondsToIso8601Duration` rounded its seconds component (`Math.round`), so a sub-second lag degraded to `PT0S` — data loss in the very consolidation meant to make the round trip lossless. A fractional value now survives as a decimal on the seconds component (ISO 8601 permits this), formatted to avoid exponent notation for very small magnitudes, and is pinned with an encode → decode round-trip test.

  **Second-round fixes (same codec, same PR):**

  - `secondsToIso8601Duration` now renders every finite magnitude as plain decimal using the shortest round-trip digit string, instead of a `toFixed(9)` floor. This closes two gaps at once: precision beyond nine fractional digits is no longer truncated, and magnitudes at or above `1e21` no longer fall into JS exponent notation (`"PT1e+21S"`) — a string the codec's own parser rejects as invalid. The full round trip now holds for `NaN`, `±Infinity`, `Math.PI`, `1e21`, `1e-10`, and ordinary values.
  - `secondsToIso8601Duration` now returns `undefined` for non-finite input (`NaN`, `±Infinity`) instead of `PT0S`. `PT0S` is a legitimate zero-lag value, so returning it for broken input fabricated a real-looking answer from a malformed one (a plausible source: a broken MSPDI `LinkLag` producing `NaN` after `Math.round`). Callers already treat `undefined` as "emit no `IFCLAGTIME`", so this refuses rather than invents, with no caller changes needed.
  - `parseIso8601Duration` now rejects a trailing bare `T` with no time component (`"P1DT"`, `"-P1DT"`), consistent with the existing rejection of bare `"P"`/`"PT"`.
  - `schedule-serializer.ts` now emits `IFCLAGTIME` for an explicit `timeLagSeconds: 0`. The prior truthiness check (`seq.timeLagSeconds ? ... : undefined`) treated an explicit zero the same as "absent" and dropped it, while an explicit `timeLagDuration: 'PT0S'` was already emitted through the neighboring `??`. Both spellings of a zero lag now behave the same.

  **Third-round fix (same codec, same PR):** `parseIso8601Duration` now rejects a component large enough to overflow to `±Infinity` (e.g. a 320-digit year component), instead of returning that `Infinity` as though it were a real duration. `secondsToIso8601Duration` already refused non-finite input on encode; the decoder accepting a magnitude its own encoder could never produce was the same asymmetry in the other direction, and `Infinity` seconds would otherwise propagate into `timeLagSeconds` and any downstream arithmetic. Malformed input is refused (`undefined`) rather than accepted, and the round trip continues to hold for every finite, representable value, including the existing table (`NaN`, `±Infinity`, `Math.PI`, `1e21`, `1e-10`, `86400`, `-172800`, `P1DT`, `P1DT1H`).

### Minor Changes

- [#2041](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2041) [`c65bdbe`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/c65bdbe033494e71e35e0222895fa1d017f0fd76) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `bim.store.addEntity` and the MCP `entity_create` tool now reject abstract IFC classes ([#2035](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2035)).

  `IfcProduct`, `IfcRoot`, `IfcRelationship` and the other ~123 EXPRESS `ABSTRACT SUPERTYPE`s are real classes, so the existing `isKnownType` guard accepted them — `addEntity('IfcProduct', …)` wrote `#N=IFCPRODUCT(...)` into the overlay and out to the exported file, which is not valid IFC.

  `@ifc-lite/parser` now exports `isInstantiable(type)`, answering `known && !abstract` from the same cross-schema union (2X3 + 4 + 4X3) `isKnownType` already resolves against. `@ifc-lite/sdk` wires it into both the `bim.store.addEntity` guard and the shared entity-type normalizer that `@ifc-lite/mutations`' `StoreEditor.addEntity` consumes — the same choke point the MCP `entity_create` tool goes through via `ensureEditor()`. Passing an abstract type now throws instead of silently authoring an invalid STEP record.

## 3.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2001](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2001) [`a2ca053`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a2ca0535c14cd1bf9d55713584766dff55430158) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **schema**: export `getInheritanceChainAcrossSchemas(type)` — the inheritance chain resolved against every bundled IFC schema (IFC2X3 + IFC4 + IFC4X3), leaf → root.

  The already-exported `getInheritanceChainForEntity` comes from the generated registry, which is pinned to IFC4*ADD2_TC1, so it answers an empty chain for any class that pin does not carry: 23 `IfcObjectDefinition` classes IFC4 dropped from IFC2X3 (`IfcMove`, `IfcOrderAction`, `IfcScheduleTimeControl`, `IfcSpaceProgram`, …) and 77 IFC4X3 additions (`IfcRoad`, `IfcBridge`, `IfcAlignment`, `IfcCourse`, …). Code that decides \_what kind of thing* an entity is — as `ifc-lite diff` does — reads an empty chain as "unknown" and gets those classes wrong on schemas that are still very common in the wild.

  This is the counterpart of the existing `getAttributeNamesAcrossSchemas`, and is the same function the columnar parser has always used internally to categorize entities. For classes the pin does know, both functions agree on every ancestor that matters; note that the two return their chains in opposite order, so pick the leaf by name rather than by position.

- [#2031](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2031) [`e4d2db5`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e4d2db5f11798e3ec78f45249139d69aa1e65275) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **schema**: `isKnownType` and `normalizeIfcTypeName` now answer for every bundled IFC schema (IFC2X3 + IFC4 + IFC4X3), not just the IFC4_ADD2_TC1 codegen pin (issue [#2003](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2003)).

  Both read `isKnownEntity` / `getEntityMetadata`, which are generated from the pin and answer "unknown" for any class it does not carry. Measured on the bundled tables: 251 real classes, including 100 `IfcObjectDefinition` ones — the IFC2X3 classes IFC4 dropped (`IfcMove`, `IfcScheduleTimeControl`, `IfcSpaceProgram`, `IfcServiceLife`, `IfcOrderAction`, …) and the IFC4X3 infrastructure classes it never had (`IfcRoad`, `IfcSignal`, `IfcAlignment`, `IfcRailway`, `IfcMarineFacility`, …). `normalizeIfcTypeName` had the same blind spot from the other side: it fell through to "preserve as-is", so `'IFCROAD'` stayed `'IFCROAD'` instead of canonicalizing to `'IfcRoad'`.

  Both now resolve against the schema union first and fall back to the pin, the same order `getInheritanceChainAcrossSchemas` uses.

  `isKnownType` is still a guard, not a pass-through. Typos (`IfcWal`, `IfcRoadd`), vendor extensions, and the 138 EXPRESS _defined types_ the upstream SchemaInfo tables carry as entity rows are all still rejected — 132 named by the cross-schema `IFC_DATA_TYPES` table (`IfcLengthMeasure`, `IfcBoolean`, `IfcCountMeasure`, …) and 6 more that only the pin's own `SCHEMA_REGISTRY.types` map names (`IfcBinary`, `IfcArcIndex`, `IfcLineIndex`, `IfcComplexNumber`, `IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure`, `IfcPropertySetDefinitionSet`). None of the 776 pinned classes appears in either table, so no IFC4 answer changes.

  It answers known-ness, not instantiability: abstract supertypes (`IfcProduct`, `IfcRoot`) are real IFC classes and still answer `true`, exactly as they did before. Rejecting those is a separate, pre-existing question — `main` already accepts 123 of them — tracked in [#2035](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2035).

  **data**: exports `IFC_DATA_TYPES`, the raw bundled defined-type table, for the same reason the `ENTITIES_*` tables are exported: a synchronous guard deciding "is this a class I may instantiate?" has to subtract the defined types, and the existing `findDataType` is async.

- [#2011](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2011) [`a5cc568`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a5cc568a642d7dd8d17f1ed7858844f9289bc841) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Export `resolveEntityNameAlias(type)`, which resolves an entity name through the legacy-alias table (`IfcSolidStratum` / `IfcVoidStratum` / `IfcWaterStratum` → `IfcGeotechnicalStratum`) and returns the name unchanged otherwise.

  Consumers that index the bundled schema union themselves — the STEP exporter's enum-slot resolution is the first — have to canonicalize exactly the way `getAttributeNamesAcrossSchemas` does, or their slot indices refer to a different attribute list than the names those indices are meant to index into. The table already has two homes (here and `rust/core/src/legacy_entities.rs`); exporting the resolver keeps a third from appearing. `getAttributeNamesAcrossSchemas` and the union inheritance walk now route through it too, so it is the one code path rather than a copy that can drift.

  IFC inherits type properties **per property**, not per property set. An occurrence and its `IfcTypeProduct` routinely both carry a set of the same name holding different properties — `Pset_CoveringCommon` with `IsExternal`/`Reference` on an `IfcCovering` and `SurfaceSpreadOfFlame`/`Combustible`/`ThermalTransmittance` on its `IfcCoveringType` is a plain Revit export. Both the IDS bridge and the viewer's Lens adapter treated a name collision as "occurrence replaces type" and dropped the entire inherited set, making every type-only property in it invisible.

  For IDS that meant a property that is present, and that other tools resolve, was reported missing: `Property "SurfaceSpreadOfFlame" not found in "Pset_CoveringCommon". Available: Pset_CoveringCommon.IsExternal, Pset_CoveringCommon.Reference`. For Lens it silently removed those properties from grouping and filtering.

  `@ifc-lite/parser` gains `mergeInheritedPropertySets(ownSets, inheritedSets)`, which unions the two per property with the occurrence winning on a property-name collision (the more specific definition), matching `IfcRelDefinesByType` semantics. Both consumers now use it, so the rule has one home rather than two divergent copies. Neither input is mutated — cached extractor results stay intact.

  Only the collision case changes. A type set whose name the occurrence does not use was already appended and still is; a property defined on both sides still resolves to the occurrence's value; a property on neither side is still absent.

  `setPositionalAttribute`, `addEntity`, and the in-store builders' own emitted
  geometry now consult the schema registry, so an integral value in a REAL-backed
  slot (`IfcLengthMeasure` coordinates, profile dimensions, extrusion depth, …)
  exports as `450.` rather than a bare `450` INTEGER literal that strict
  validators (`ifcopenshell.validate`) reject. Integer-typed slots are left
  untouched; the `{ real }` marker still works for genuinely ambiguous selects.
  Positional names resolve across the schema union so IFC4X3-only alignment/civil
  entities are covered too. Exposes `getAttributeNamesAcrossSchemas` from
  `@ifc-lite/parser`.

  path where it is never used. When the host promises an entity-index handoff
  (`waitForEntityIndex`, gated on files ≥2 MB), the geometry pre-pass builds the
  index and the entity scanner resolves from it, short-circuiting before the WASM
  scan ever runs — so eager-compiling the engine binary there only stole a core
  from the concurrent pre-pass. The compile is now deferred: eager on the
  no-handoff path, and lazy on the fallback branch if the promised index never
  arrives. Behaviour is unchanged (a new test pins that a pre-scanned index
  resolves with no `wasmApi`).

- [#1857](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1857) [`205a136`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/205a136ee69e378ea01cd0d0a8a6dc81cf2fb08f) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Route `getStoreyByElevation` through the shared `findStoreyByElevation` resolver from `@ifc-lite/data` (issue [#1841](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1841)).

  Both packages previously shipped their own always-snap-to-nearest implementations: the worker-transport rehydration in `@ifc-lite/parser` (`data-store-transport.ts`) and the IFCX hierarchy builder (`hierarchy-builder.ts`). Both now apply the same 1m tolerance and deterministic tie-break as the fresh-parse path, so a Z resolves to the same storey regardless of entry path or which side of the worker boundary the store was read from.

- [#1921](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1921) [`428c5ae`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/428c5ae54bac236a3950f451ee12a0dc23226336) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - The WASM engine binary (`ifc-lite_bg.wasm`) is now downloaded resiliently and identifiably from every entry point.

  `IfcLiteBridge.init()` — the main-thread initialisation, and the only self-fetching `init()` in the codebase that still lacked one — now runs through `initWasmWithRetry`, the same one-shot retry both the geometry and parser workers have used since [#1363](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1363). A single blip on the ~1.3 MB engine download no longer fails the whole model load; a first-time visitor pulling the binary cold is the case this protects.

  `initWasmWithRetry` also names the binary when the final failure names nothing. A network-level rejection propagates raw out of wasm-bindgen's loader — WebKit words it `TypeError: Load failed`, Chromium `TypeError: Failed to fetch` — with an empty stack, so neither the user-facing message nor error tracking could tell what had failed to load. Such a failure is now rethrown as `Failed to load the WASM engine binary (ifc-lite_bg.wasm) in <label>: <original>`, with the original preserved as `.cause`. Messages that already identify themselves (any `wasm` / `WebAssembly` phrasing, and failed module imports) are passed through byte-for-byte so the stale-deployment matchers keep working.

  No public API surface changed.

  - parser: new `unwrapIfcZipWithResources` surfaces sibling raster images (the files `IfcImageTexture.URLReference` points at) alongside the model entry, keyed by lowercased basename; `unwrapIfcZip` is unchanged.
  - geometry/wasm: `IfcImageTexture` now resolves to a lightweight reference (`textureId` = the `IfcSurfaceTexture` express id, URL, repeat flags) instead of being dropped — the host decodes the image once per id, so a 4096² JPEG shared by dozens of face sets is decoded and uploaded exactly once. `IfcIndexedTriangleTextureMap` with a null `TexCoordIndex` (the SketchUp IFC Manager export shape) now maps UVs 1:1 with the face set's coordinates per spec. Textured face sets on ORDINARY occurrences (direct `Body` items, not just type-product representation maps) now carry UVs + texture through the sub-mesh path, and blob/pixel texture decodes are Arc-shared instead of cloned per face set.
  - renderer: textured meshes with an external image reference render through the existing WebGPU textured pipeline via a refcounted shared-texture registry (one GPU texture per `textureId`, uploaded from the viewer-decoded `ImageBitmap`); per-mesh [#961](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/961) blob/pixel uploads are unchanged.
  - viewer: `.ifcZIP` loads decode sibling images with `createImageBitmap` and attach them to arriving meshes; textured models skip the binary geometry cache (which cannot persist textures yet) instead of silently losing textures on the second open.

  - **Multiple `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial` per element** are no longer lost. New `resolveAllMaterialDefIds` / `extractAllMaterialsOnDemand` surface every association (relationship-graph backed, ordered by rel express id). The single-entry `onDemandMaterialMap` "primary" is now deterministic — the association with the LOWEST rel express id wins — and the viewer cache rebuild applies the same rule, so a cache load can no longer disagree with a fresh parse. Models where the old last-wins rule picked a later association may report a different primary material in single-value surfaces (MCP/CLI/SDK).
  - `buildMaterialUsageIndex` lists elements under EVERY associated material, so the By Material tab and per-material totals include secondary associations.
  - `extractMaterialPropertiesOnDemand` aggregates `Pset_Material*` across all associations instead of only the primary.
  - **IDS**: material facets now check every association — a requirement satisfied only by an element's second association no longer false-fails.
  - **Constituent-set fractions**: constituents without an authored `Fraction` receive an equal share of the unallocated remainder instead of weight 0, so they contribute to per-material quantity totals.

On the unknown-type fixed-index fallback, a PredefinedType enum landing on attribute 7 (e.g. IFC4X3 `IfcAlignment`) is stored by the extractor as a dotted string (`.USERDEFINED.`) and used to surface as the element's `Tag`. It's now rejected (rendered blank), mirroring the Rust server path — so the `Tag`, `Description`, and `ObjectType` list columns match across parse paths. Known types are unaffected (their schema indices point at genuine string slots).

Previously the usage index keyed such materials to the type entity itself, which the viewer's By Material tree dropped via its geometry filter and the totals panel mis-attributed.

  `deterministicGlobalId` masked its first output character with the full 6-bit alphabet, but a valid 22-char IFC GlobalId encodes only 2 bits in its first character (128 = 2 + 21\*6). The id is now stamped from the hash's 128-bit state MSB-first exactly like `uuidToIfcGuid`'s compression, so it always decodes to a well-formed 128-bit UUID and re-encodes bit-exactly. This also fixes a severe entropy loss in the previous stamping: it read each state word's LOW 6 bits while evolving it with a 32-bit multiply (which never propagates high bits downward), leaving ~24 bits of effective entropy and real collisions at ~10k seeds; the full-state stamping is collision-free across 100k adversarial seeds.

  Header string round-trip no longer corrupts ISO-10303-21 escapes: `parseSourceHeader` now decodes `\X2\`, `\X\`, `\S\` and `\Px\` directives to real Unicode (via the canonical `decodeIfcString`) instead of leaving them for the writer's backslash-doubling escaper to mangle (`Tr\X2\00FC\X0\mpler` no longer becomes `Tr\\X2\\00FC\\X0\\mpler`), and collapses the `\\` escape to a single literal backslash first, so `C:\temp` is byte-stable across repeated write/read cycles instead of growing backslashes. The shared STEP string escaper (data) also collapses control characters to a space so a header/attribute value can never inject a physical line break.

  - encoding: `decodeIfcString` no longer throws a `RangeError` on a `\X4\` sequence whose 8-hex value exceeds the Unicode maximum (`0x10FFFF`); it now emits U+FFFD instead. The previous throw propagated uncaught through the columnar batch-name path and aborted the entire model load. Surrogate values in `\X4\` and lone surrogates in `\X2\` also decode to U+FFFD now (surrogate pairs split across `\X2\` groups still combine), matching the Rust decoder (`char::from_u32` / `String::from_utf16_lossy`) so both parse paths yield identical strings.
  - parser: `onDemandMaterialMap` is now list-valued, so a second `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial` targeting the same element is preserved instead of last-wins overwritten. `buildMaterialUsageIndex` gains a relationship-graph fallback for server-loaded stores: it works on the real server store shape (empty `source` buffer, facade relationship graph with closure-only accessors), with `collectMaterialLeaves` surfacing each definition as one opaque full-weight leaf when no source is available. An empty index built from a store with no material inputs at all is no longer memoised (so a later-populated store can rebuild). `IfcMaterialConstituent` weights now always sum to 1: siblings without an explicit `Fraction` share the remainder instead of collapsing to weight 0, sets where explicit fractions already fill the whole are renormalised (`{1.0, unset}` -> 2/3, 1/3 rather than 1.5x totals), and non-finite or non-positive fractions/layer thicknesses are treated as unset.
  - parser: the inline worker scanner's type-name cache now byte-verifies on a hit (matching `tokenizer.ts`), so a 32-bit hash collision can no longer alias two distinct type names on the default scan path.
  - parser: batch GlobalId+Name extraction now collapses STEP doubled single-quotes (`''` -> `'`), matching `EntityExtractor`, so names like `John''s Wall` render correctly.
  - cache: the writer no longer sets the dead `HasSpatial` header flag (no Spatial section is written or read), and the string-table read path preserves positions via `StringTable.fromArray` instead of re-interning (which deduped, shifting later indices when a duplicate was present). On-disk format is unchanged.

A column mapped to a pset/qto that lives on an element's `IfcTypeProduct` (via `IfcRelDefinesByType`) — e.g. `Pset_WallCommon.FireRating` or `Qto_WallBaseQuantities.Width` defined once on `IfcWallType` — now falls back to the type when the instance has no local value, so it no longer renders a blank cell. Instance-level values still take precedence, and the same fallback applies to list filter conditions.

  `@ifc-lite/parser` gains `extractTypeQuantitiesOnDemand` (and the `extractQsetsFromIds` helper) mirroring the existing `extractTypePropertiesOnDemand`. `@ifc-lite/lists` gains optional `getTypePropertySets` / `getTypeQuantitySets` accessors on `ListDataProvider`; providers that don't implement them keep their previous behaviour (no fallback).

  - The spatial hierarchy now records an aggregated-descendant containment walk for ANY spatial container node, not just storeys, via a new optional `SpatialHierarchy.elementToContainer` map (also carried across data-store transport). A part nested through an IfcElementAssembly under an IfcBridgePart / IfcRoadPart / IfcSpatialZone now resolves that container instead of a blank cell. Storey-only `elementToStorey` semantics are unchanged.
  - The list engine matches the spatial level string case-insensitively, so a hand-edited / imported list carrying `container` resolves the Container level rather than silently falling back to the storey name. An empty or unrecognised level still defaults to Storey.

(1) A geometry or pre-pass worker whose SCRIPT fails to load (a redeploy rotated the hashed asset; the 404 is served as text/plain and the browser blocks the worker with an empty-message onerror) now dispatches the existing version-skew recovery event so the viewer reloads once onto the current deployment, instead of dying with "Pre-pass worker failed: undefined". (2) The parser skips the byte-level WASM entity scan for sources over 2.5GB: the buffer copy plus entity index cannot fit in wasm32's 4GB address space, so the scan always trapped with `unreachable executed` before the JS tokeniser fallback ran anyway.

  - `@ifc-lite/data`: `SpatialNode` gains an optional `longName?: string` (the descriptive name, kept only when present and distinct from `name`). Additive and optional; existing consumers are unaffected.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser`: `SpatialHierarchyBuilder` now reads `LongName` off the source record by schema attribute _name_ and populates `SpatialNode.longName`. Resolving by name (not a fixed index) keeps it correct across the IfcRoot family, since `IfcProject` carries `LongName` at a different index than the `IfcSpatialStructureElement` subtypes; the lookup spans the bundled schema union (2X3 + 4 + 4X3) via the new `getAttributeNamesAcrossSchemas`, so IFC4.3 facility/infra containers (`IfcFacility`, `IfcBridge`, `IfcRoad`, …) outside the parser's IFC4 codegen pin resolve too. When `Name` is empty it falls back to `LongName` for the primary label. The source-less `buildFromCache` path leaves it undefined, exactly like storey elevation. `data-store-transport` serializes the new field so the worker→main transfer preserves it.
  - `@ifc-lite/ifcx`: the IFCX/IFC5 hierarchy builder populates `SpatialNode.longName` from `bsi::ifc::prop::LongName` for parity.

  - `extractProjectUnits(source, entityIndex) -> ProjectUnits` — reads `IfcSIUnit` (with prefixes), `IfcDerivedUnit` (composed, e.g. `m³/s`), `IfcConversionBasedUnit` (°, ft, ...) and `IfcMonetaryUnit` from `IFCPROJECT.UnitsInContext`. Never throws: an absent/malformed assignment yields an empty `ProjectUnits` (every measure falls back to its SI default symbol).
  - `ProjectUnits.unitForMeasure(measureType)` / `.resolvedForUnitType(unitType)` / `.monetary()` — the per-measure and per-unit-type display resolvers.
  - `measureUnit(measureType) -> MeasureUnit | undefined` — maps an IFC measure value type name (e.g. `"IFCVOLUMETRICFLOWRATEMEASURE"`) to its unit-type token, or `{kind: 'monetary'}` / `{kind: 'dimensionless'}` for currency and unit-less measures.
  - `ResolvedUnit` (`{symbol, siScale}`) and `MeasureUnit` types.

  The viewer uses this to show property/quantity values with the file's actual declared unit instead of always assuming SI, and (issue [#1573](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1573) proposal 2) to power a non-destructive per-unit-type display-unit converter. The implementation is pinned to shared parity test vectors against the Rust mirror in `rust/core/src/project_units/` (`packages/parser/src/project-units.parity.test.ts`), so the two can't drift.

  The buildingSMART IFC container format — a zip archive wrapping a single
  `.ifc`/`.ifcxml` file — is now unwrapped transparently. New `@ifc-lite/parser`
  exports:

  - `isZipBuffer(buffer)` — cheap magic-byte check.
  - `unwrapIfcZip(buffer)` — returns the model file's bytes if `buffer` is a
    zip container, or `buffer` unchanged otherwise (safe to call
    unconditionally on every load). Throws if the archive has zero or more
    than one `.ifc`/`.ifcxml` entry rather than guessing which to load, or if
    the entry's declared uncompressed size exceeds 4 GiB (a zip-bomb guard,
    checked from the zip central directory — no decompression needed to check).
  - `unwrapIfcZipView(view)` — same contract for a Node `Buffer`/`Uint8Array`.

  `parseAuto` calls it automatically. The CLI and MCP loaders (`loadIfcFile`,
  `loadIfcModel`) unwrap before their STEP-signature check, so `ifc-lite info
model.ifcZIP` and MCP's `model_load` just work. The viewer's file picker and
  drag-and-drop now accept `.ifczip` alongside `.ifc`/`.ifcx`/`.glb`.

  The hosted Rust parsing server (`apps/server`) unwraps `.ifcZIP` too, in its
  multipart `extract_file` path (alongside the existing gzip handling), so an
  uploaded container is decompressed server-side before parsing and the viewer's
  multi-core server fast-path works for zipped uploads. It applies the same
  single-`.ifc`/`.ifcxml`-entry rule and bounds the decompressed size against the
  server's max-file-size ceiling (zip-bomb guard).

  Referenced resources inside the container (textures, documents) are not
  extracted in this pass — only the model file's bytes.

  On models without an `IfcMapConversion`, the on-demand georeferencing extractor
  scans and decodes every `IfcPropertySet` from the source buffer to find
  `ePset_MapConversion` / `ePset_ProjectedCRS`. On property-set-heavy models that
  is tens of thousands of entity decodes per call, and the viewer invokes it on
  the render path (once per streamed geometry batch), so the cost compounded to
  O(batches x propertySets) and could stall large-model loads by an order of
  magnitude. The result is a pure function of the immutable source + entityIndex
  (georef edits are layered on top later in `getEffectiveGeoreference`), so the
  extraction is now memoized per store via a `WeakMap`, collapsing it to a single
  scan per model. Not-yet-loaded stores (missing source/entityIndex) are not
  cached, so a store that fills in later still recomputes.

  IFC2X3 has no native `IfcMapConversion`/`IfcProjectedCRS`, so tools like `ifc-georeferencer` store georeferencing in property sets per the buildingSMART guide. Three bugs dropped these models to the legacy `IfcSite` lat/long (`EPSG:4326`), so two files differing only by CRS (`EPSG:7415` RD+NAP vs `EPSG:28992` RD) both displayed the same wrong CRS:

  - The pset-name match was case-sensitive (`ePSet_`/`EPset_`) and missed the real-world `ePset_` casing — now matched case-insensitively in both the TS (`extractGeoreferencing`) and Rust (`GeoRefExtractor`) extractors.
  - The ePSet path never read `ePset_ProjectedCRS.Name` (nor `MapConversion.TargetCRS`), so the EPSG code was discarded — now surfaced, with typed `IFCLABEL(...)`/`IFCLENGTHMEASURE(...)` values unwrapped.
  - The viewer's on-demand extractor never loaded the property sets at all — now pulls in the georef ePSets + their values (only when no `IfcMapConversion` exists, deferred-atom safe).

  The viewer's Cesium/federation gate accepts the `ePSetMapConversion` source, and ePSet offsets are scaled by the project length unit (millimetres for these files) so the model reprojects to the correct location instead of ~1000× out of range. The offline reproject fallback for the compound `EPSG:7415` (datum reported as `RD`) now carries the Kadaster `+towgs84` shift.

Added `buildFromCache(entities, relationships)` for cache restores (no source buffer, so storey elevations stay empty and `getStoreyByElevation` returns null), alongside the existing `build(...)` for fresh parses. Both entry points share one `buildNode`, so they can no longer drift: the fresh path now also applies the aggregate-descendant storey mapping (an `IfcBuildingElementPart` under an `IfcWall` resolves to that wall's storey), and the cache path now also has the cyclic-`IfcRelAggregates` guard. The viewer's duplicate `rebuildSpatialHierarchy` becomes a thin wrapper over `buildFromCache`.

  Two independent defects made Exploded mode look broken:

  - GPU-instanced occurrences (repeated geometry emitted via `IfcMappedItem`, e.g.
    windows / mullions) were never lifted with their storey, because the per-entity
    translate only touched the flat `meshDataMap` and not the instanced shard. They
    stayed at their native elevation while the rest of the storey rose ("objects
    left behind"). `Scene.translateInstancedEntity` now shifts each occurrence's
    transform in both the CPU instance record and the GPU buffer, plus its cached
    world AABB, so pick / measure / section / export stay correct. This also fixes
    moving an instanced element with the gizmo.

  - A storey whose `Elevation` attribute is null (common in Revit / ArchiCAD
    exports) was dropped from the elevation map, so Exploded mode had a single
    floor to order ("only one floor"). The spatial-hierarchy builder now falls back
    to the storey's `ObjectPlacement` Z when the attribute is missing.

  When the `ifc-lite_bg.wasm` binary fails to download (non-OK HTTP status, a cold
  CDN edge, a mid-deploy race, or a blocking proxy/antivirus), wasm-bindgen's
  streaming loader rethrows a cryptic `Failed to execute 'compile' on
'WebAssembly': HTTP status code is not ok`. The geometry and parser workers now
  retry `init()` once on such fetch/HTTP-shaped failures, and the viewer maps the
  failure to actionable guidance ("reload the page") instead of surfacing the raw
  TypeError. Captured exceptions are tagged with a stable `error_kind` for triage.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1143](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1143) [`248f2c0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/248f2c09a4d61fa27dfeaba5511a2a641d4cd278) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Preserve source IFC HEADER fields on round-trip export. Re-exporting an
  imported file previously regenerated a fresh ifc-lite header, silently dropping
  the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items (any `ViewDefinition [...]` label and vendor
  identifier / coordinate-reference strings) and flattening the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token (e.g. `IFC4X3_ADD2` → `IFC4X3`, which some toolchains
  reject).

  The parser now captures the verbatim HEADER onto a new
  `IfcDataStore.sourceHeader` (`IfcSourceHeader`, exported from `@ifc-lite/data`;
  parser also exports `parseSourceHeader`), threaded through the worker transport.
  `StepExporter` reproduces the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items and the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token when not converting schemas, falling back to parsing the
  source bytes for cache-restored stores. Provenance stays honest:
  `preprocessor_version` is set to `ifc-lite` while the source authoring tool is
  kept as `originating_system`, and when mutations exist exactly one
  `Re-exported by ifc-lite, N modification(s)` item is appended without removing
  the source items. `generateHeader` now accepts description/author/organization
  arrays plus a free-form schema token and STEP-escapes all fields; it also emits
  a properly parenthesised `FILE_DESCRIPTION` list (the prior single-string form
  was malformed STEP). Created-from-scratch (`IfcCreator`) and federated/merged
  exports are unaffected — they keep their own provenance headers by design.

### Patch Changes

- [#1151](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1151) [`bfd9004`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bfd9004daa17f481a7b33b5c3c11f620e6cd894d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - De-duplicate the STEP serializer into a single source of truth. The
  schema-agnostic STEP serialization logic (`serializeValue`, `generateHeader`,
  `parseStepValue`, `ref`/`enumVal`/`isEntityRef`/`isEnumValue`, and the
  registry-injected `toStepLineWithRegistry` / `generateStepFileWithRegistry`)
  previously existed as four hand-synced copies — the codegen template plus three
  generated `serializers.ts` files — which had already silently drifted (the
  runtime copy carried a `?? []` hardening the template lacked). It now lives once
  in `@ifc-lite/data`; the per-schema bundles (parser runtime + codegen outputs)
  are thin re-exports that only bind their own `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` to the
  registry-coupled helpers, so the copies can never diverge again. A codegen test
  asserts the generated bundle stays a thin re-export rather than re-inlining
  logic.

  Also fixes the broken `generate:ifc4` script (it pointed at a non-existent
  `schemas/IFC4.exp`; the real file is `schemas/IFC4_ADD2_TC1.exp`). No public
  behaviour change: `@ifc-lite/parser` re-exports the same serializer symbols as
  before; `@ifc-lite/data` gains the shared primitives; `@ifc-lite/codegen` now
  declares `@ifc-lite/data` as a dependency since the generated bundle imports it.

- [#1145](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1145) [`ddae2b0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ddae2b0024f071d00f9e6e4b77e0be3965412ec3) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Resolve names for IfcGroup-family entities and make zones/systems listable ([#1075](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1075) follow-up).

  `IfcZone`, `IfcGroup`, `IfcSystem` and `IfcDistributionSystem` are not `IfcProduct` subtypes, so the columnar parser categorised them as `CAT_SKIP` and never added them to the `EntityTable`. As a result `getName()` returned `''` (the UI showed "Group #<id>"), `getByType()` could not find them (so they were absent from lists), and the "By Zone" lens fell back to an arbitrary first group because `getTypeName()` returned `Unknown`. `IfcSpatialZone` was in the table but its `Name` was never extracted.

  This routes the group family into the `EntityTable` with `Name` (falling back to `LongName` for systems/zones that leave `Name` empty) plus `Description` and `ObjectType` (the system designation), and extracts names for the previously-unnamed "other relevant" products (including `IfcSpatialZone`). New `IfcSystem` / `IfcDistributionSystem` `IfcTypeEnum` entries make systems addressable by `getByType`. Zones, spatial zones and systems are now selectable in the list builder and ship a "Zones & Systems" preset, the relationship card and "By Zone" lens legend show real names (with an `ObjectType` fallback for unnamed systems), and selecting a group surfaces its attributes.

  The cache `FORMAT_VERSION` is bumped (6 → 7) so models cached before the fix re-parse and pick up the resolved names.

  - `@ifc-lite/parser`: `extractGeoreferencing` gains the IFC2x3 `ePSet_MapConversion` fallback with the same precedence as the Rust extractor (`IfcMapConversion` → ePSet → legacy `IfcSite` lat/long); `GeoreferenceInfo.source` union widens to include `'ePSetMapConversion'`.
  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `Georeferencing` gains optional `crs_description`, `map_zone`, `map_unit`, `map_unit_scale`, and `source` fields — the server now reports MapUnit-scaled conversions (e.g. 0.001 for millimetre-based files), picks the FIRST authored `IfcMapConversion` like the browser parser, normalises non-unit X-axis directions so `transform_matrix` agrees with `rotation_degrees`, and recognises site-only models via the `IfcSite.RefLatitude/RefLongitude` fallback.

- [#1076](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1076) [`da1999f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/da1999fc6e482fa3d668b9aa98a840d2bb838112) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add `createSyntheticDataStore()` — a typed factory for building a fully-typed
  `IfcDataStore` for synthetic / non-STEP models (GLB meshes, point-cloud scans).
  It assembles real `@ifc-lite/data` tables (empty, or a single synthetic entity
  row) and wires the lazy `getEntity` / `getEntitiesByType` / `getProperties` /
  `getQuantities` accessors through `attachDataStoreAccessors`, the same single
  source of truth the columnar parse / worker transport / cache restore use.

  The viewer's GLB (`createMinimalGlbDataStore`) and LAS/LAZ point-cloud
  (`emptyDataStore`) ingest paths now build their synthetic stores through this
  factory instead of whole-object `as unknown as IfcDataStore` casts. Those casts
  silently dropped the `IfcStoreBase` accessors, so a future required
  `IfcDataStore` member stayed green at the cast site and threw
  `TypeError: store.getProperties is not a function` at runtime on the
  GLB / point-cloud ingest flow (same crash class as [#950](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/950)). The contract is now
  compiler-enforced for these synthetic stores.

  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `IfcCreator` now generates spec-valid 128-bit GlobalIds via the canonical `@ifc-lite/encoding` encoder (previously ~94% of generated ids failed `isValidIfcGuid` and silently changed identity on guid→uuid→guid round-trips, e.g. in BCF).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: schema-downgrade `IFCPROXY` placeholders now carry spec-valid GlobalIds instead of synthetic `PROXY_…` markers.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser`: `extractLengthUnitScale` now mirrors the canonical Rust extractor when an `IfcMeasureWithUnit` ValueComponent is unreadable — defaults the value to 1.0 and still applies the UnitComponent SI-prefix instead of falling through to metres (property scaling can no longer desync from geometry scaling).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: removed the dead legacy worker protocol (`process`/`prepass`/`prepass-fast` messages) — the streaming protocol (`stream-start`/`stream-chunk`/`stream-end` + `prepass-streaming`) is the only path; the wasm `buildPrePassFast` export is gone. Streaming pre-pass loads now apply aggregate void propagation (window/door cuts on aggregated parts) in parity with one-shot loads and the server.
  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ProcessingStats` gains optional `total_csg_failures` / `products_with_failures` fields — the server now reports the same CSG failure diagnostics the browser console shows.

  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ServerConfig.token` sends `Authorization: Bearer` on every request (servers running `IFC_SERVER_API_TOKEN` were unreachable from the TS client); the `ParseResponse` / `ProcessingStats` / `MeshData` mirrors gain the optional fields the Rust server actually serves (`mesh_coordinate_space`, transforms, scan/lookup/preprocess timings, mesh metadata).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: the worker-pool converter now carries `shadingColor` across the worker boundary — GLB "Shading" export no longer degrades on the default (parallel) load path; dead legacy wasm bindings removed (`IfcAPI.parse`, `parseStreaming`, `scanRelevantEntitiesFastBytes`, `MeshCollection.localToWorld`).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: `assembleStepBytes` deduplicated into `step-serialization` (was copied byte-for-byte in the STEP and merged exporters).

  Validating a 550k-entity model against an 848-spec IDS document took ~19
  minutes of CPU, produced multi-GB reports, and the CLI then hung forever
  after printing its results. Four root fixes:

  - parser: `yieldToEventLoop` leaked one open `MessageChannel` per yield;
    in Node an open `MessagePort` holds a libuv handle, so every CLI command
    on a large file kept the process alive after completion. Ports now close
    (helper consolidated into one shared module).
  - ids: `validateIDS` wraps the accessor in a per-run memoizing cache so
    property sets / types / attributes are extracted once per entity instead
    of once per entity _per specification_ (O(specs×entities) source
    re-parses → O(entities)). Enumeration constraints additionally compile
    into exact-match sets (real-world code lists carry 800+ values).
  - ids: per-entity result strings are now bounded — enumeration constraints
    render at most 10 values in failure messages, and the entity-independent
    requirement description is formatted once per requirement instead of per
    entity result (reports for failing models dropped from GBs to MBs).
  - cli: `ifc-lite ids` now uses the canonical `@ifc-lite/ids/bridge`
    accessor (the drifted local copy missed type-inherited property sets),
    reports real progress (`spec 312/848 (37%)` instead of
    `undefined (undefined/undefined)`), and skips retaining passing entity
    results for human-readable output (`--json` is unchanged).

  Behavior change (intentional): the CLI's PASS/FAIL verdict and exit code
  now come from the validator's per-spec status, which counts
  cardinality-only failures — a `minOccurs="1"` specification that matches
  zero entities now correctly FAILs (exit 1) where it previously passed
  silently. `bim.ids.summarize` likewise prefers the per-spec status when
  the report carries one, so `--json` and text mode agree on the verdict.

  Measured on the same model + IDS pack: 848 specs 19min→2min, 117 specs
  3.4min→12s, both with a clean exit instead of a hang.

The fresh-parse worker→main transport path now uses it instead of duplicating the wiring inline.

  This fixes a crash when querying a model loaded from the on-disk cache: the cache format only serialises data, so a restored store was missing these accessor methods, and opening the Properties panel for a cached entity threw `store.getEntity is not a function` (the viewer's cache-restore path now calls `attachDataStoreAccessors`).

  Material property sets attached to an `IfcMaterial` via `IfcMaterialProperties`
  (e.g. `Pset_MaterialConcrete`) are now resolved and shown:

  - **On the selected object** — a "Material Properties" group in the inspector,
    resolved through the element's material association (fanning a layer / profile /
    constituent set out to each member material), mirroring how type psets surface
    on an occurrence.
  - **A new "Materials" hierarchy tab** — lists every base material; selecting one
    isolates its elements and shows the material's own psets plus quantities
    (volume / area / weight) aggregated across all using elements, apportioned by
    each element's material share (layer thickness / constituent fraction).

  New parser exports: `extractMaterialPropertiesOnDemand`,
  `extractMaterialPropertiesForMaterialId`, `buildMaterialUsageIndex`,
  `collectMaterialLeaves`, `resolveMaterialDefId`, `getMaterialDisplay`, and the
  `MaterialPsetGroup` / `MaterialLeaf` / `MaterialUsage` types.

  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).

### Major Changes

- [#874](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/874) [`e73ac09`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e73ac0931b85cd299ae9b723073e956b6b124c85) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Remove unused public exports that had zero consumers anywhere in the monorepo (coordinated breaking change). Each was verified against internal code, the other apps, the examples, the scaffolding templates, and the docs before removal.

  - **@ifc-lite/geometry**: drop `LODGenerator` / `LODConfig` / `LODMesh` (`lod.ts`), `DEFAULT_MATERIALS` / `getDefaultColor` / `getDefaultMaterialColor` / `MaterialColor` (`default-materials.ts`), and `calculateDynamicBatchSize`.
  - **@ifc-lite/parser**: drop `StyleExtractor` (and its `IFCMaterial` / `StyleMapping` types) and `OpfsSourceBuffer`.
  - **@ifc-lite/data**: drop `isBuildingLikeSpatialTypeName` — the enum-based `isBuildingLikeSpatialType` and the other spatial-type predicates stay.
  - **@ifc-lite/extensions**: drop `slugify` and `suggestedExtensionId`; the sibling id helpers (`suggestedCommandId`, `flavorImportedId`, `flavorMergedId`, `DEFAULT_FLAVOR_ID`) are retained.
  - **@ifc-lite/wasm**: drop the debug-only `debugProcessEntity953` / `debugProcessFirstWall` methods and the never-wired `scanEntityIndexShard` (Path C sharded-scan) export.

  Also removes the dead `ifc-lite-engine` crate (no workspace dependents) and the no-op `serde` feature on `ifc-lite-core` (it gated no code).

## 2.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#834](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/834) [`bdb9978`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bdb997842fe38627fefbcddf250fc0136289bc84) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Three IFC geometry fixes plus a Dutch / metric-export properties-panel fix.

  - **[#820](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/820) — `IfcTrimmedCurve` parameter values now respect `PLANEANGLEUNIT`.**
    `process_trimmed_conic` previously called `.to_radians()` unconditionally,
    silently shrinking a 240° arc to ~4° on files that declare
    `IFCSIUNIT(*,.PLANEANGLEUNIT.,$,.RADIAN.)` (e.g. the Renga-exported
    `RadianValuesOverPI.ifc` wall whose trim values are `5.7596`/`9.9484`
    radians). Added `extract_plane_angle_to_radians` to `ifc_lite_core::units`
    and a lazy lookup on `EntityDecoder` so the right scale (1.0 for RADIAN
    files, π/180 for DEGREE conversion-based units) is applied without
    per-call IFC scanning.

  - **[#821](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/821) — `IfcBooleanResult.DIFFERENCE` falls back to the un-cut host when
    the subtract emits an empty mesh from a non-empty host.** Revit IFC2x3
    exports (e.g. `TallBuilding.ifc`) sometimes author top-trim
    `IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace` planes that land exactly on the wall's top
    with `AgreementFlag = .T.`, making the spec-strict half-space material
    region exactly cover the wall body — the strict subtract returns nothing
    and the wall vanishes. Production viewers (BIMVision, IfcOpenShell) revert
    to the host in this case; the processor now does the same and records the
    loss as `BoolFailureReason::DifferenceEmptiedHost` so it surfaces in CSG
    diagnostics rather than disappearing silently.

  - **[#819](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/819) — `IfcTriangulatedFaceSet` flat-shades by default.** Without
    per-vertex `Normals` the downstream normal accumulator was smooth-averaging
    face normals across every shared vertex, smearing crisp facet edges into
    muddy gradients on faceted geometry (visible on the
    `IFC4TessellationComplex.ifc` dome compared to BIMVision's flat-shaded
    render). The processor now duplicates vertices per-triangle and writes
    per-face normals, matching what `IfcPolygonalFaceSet` already does and
    the IfcOpenShell / web-ifc default.

  - **Layer thickness display in the properties panel** (`MaterialCard`)
    showed "60.0 m" for a 60 mm prefab slab on `LENGTHUNIT=MILLI.METRE`
    files. `material-resolver` now multiplies the raw `IfcMaterialLayer.LayerThickness`
    by `store.lengthUnitScale` before storing it, so `formatThickness` sees a
    proper metres value and reports "60.0 mm".

  Adds three regression tests pinned to fixtures under `tests/models/issues/`:

  - `issue_819_triangulated_normals.rs`
  - `issue_820_trimmed_curve_planeangleunit.rs`
  - `issue_821_difference_emptied_host.rs`

  Catalogue updated; fixtures will be uploaded to the `fixtures-v1` release.

### Patch Changes

- [#658](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/658) [`bfb5e1b`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/bfb5e1bdc917ab771de4540b6c5686b9fb0e5fa7) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Restore IFC2X3 georeferencing extraction from legacy site locations and standard map conversion data so Cesium placement and inspector metadata stay available for older models.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#629](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/629) [`2ab0e4c`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2ab0e4c0eafc21feb22bfc7cd96c467b8b9ff599) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **Parse IFC off the main thread.** The browser viewer now runs `IfcParser.parseColumnar`
  inside a dedicated `WorkerParser` worker that shares the source bytes via
  `SharedArrayBuffer` with the existing geometry workers. Parse and geometry
  streaming run in parallel without contending for main-thread time, cutting
  upload-to-interactive wall-clock by roughly 2× on medium-to-large files.

  New public APIs:

  - `@ifc-lite/parser`

    - `WorkerParser` (browser-only, exported from `@ifc-lite/parser/browser`)
    - `data-store-transport`: `toTransport(store)` / `fromTransport(payload, source)`
      plus the `DataStoreTransport` payload type. Lets any consumer ship a
      fully-typed `IfcDataStore` across a `postMessage` boundary with the
      typed-array buffers in the transfer list and closures rebuilt on receipt.

  - `@ifc-lite/data`

    - `entityTableFromColumns` / `entityTableToColumns`
    - `propertyTableFromColumns` / `propertyTableToColumns`
    - `quantityTableFromColumns` / `quantityTableToColumns`
    - `relationshipGraphFromColumns` / `relationshipGraphToColumns`
    - `relationshipEdgesFromColumns`, `relationshipGraphFromEdges`, `buildCSR`
    - `StringTable.fromArray(strings)`
    - `EntityTable.rawTypeName` is now exposed (optional column) so the
      unknown-type display fallback round-trips through column transports.

  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`

    - `processParallel(buffer, coordinator, sharedRtcOffset?, existingSab?, options?)`:
      `existingSab` lets the geometry workers reuse a SAB the caller already
      populated. The new fifth argument is `ProcessParallelOptions` with:
      - `onEntityIndex(ids, starts, lengths)`: invoked once the streaming
        pre-pass has built the entity index. Hosts forward the SAB-shared
        columns to `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex(...)` so the parser skips
        its own ~10 s WASM scan.
      - `useSingleController`: opt-in (off by default) to the experimental
        single-controller + wasm-bindgen-rayon path. See
        `docs/architecture/single-controller-rayon-design.md` §12 for the
        post-mortem on when this helps and when it regresses.
    - `GeometryProcessor.processParallel` and `processAdaptive` accept the
      same options to plumb them through.
    - `StreamingGeometryEvent` gains a `workerMemory` variant carrying
      per-worker WASM heap + mesh-byte counts for memory accounting.

  - `@ifc-lite/parser` (additions on top of the worker entry above)
    - `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex(ids, starts, lengths)`: hand a pre-built
      entity index to the worker's `IfcAPI`. Pairs with the geometry
      pre-pass's `onEntityIndex` callback above.
    - `WorkerParserOptions.waitForEntityIndex`: when true, the worker blocks
      its WASM scan until `setEntityIndex` arrives (60 s watchdog falls
      back to the regular scan if it never does).
    - `IfcParser.parseColumnar`: signature widened to accept
      `ArrayBuffer | SharedArrayBuffer` (was `ArrayBuffer`); the SAB-backed
      parser worker no longer needs an `as unknown as ArrayBuffer` cast.

  The viewer auto-falls back to the in-process `IfcParser` when
  `crossOriginIsolated` is `false` or the worker spawn throws, so behavior is
  unchanged in environments without SAB.

  pointcloud samples (`pcd::base64`, `points::array`, `points::base64`).

  - New `@ifc-lite/pointcloud` package: renderer-agnostic decoders for PCD
    (ASCII / binary / binary_compressed via inline LZF) and the two inline
    IFCx point schemas. Pure TS, no three.js, no WebGPU.
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry` adds `PointCloudAsset` and `GeometryResult.pointClouds`.
  - `@ifc-lite/ifcx` adds `extractPointClouds()` and surfaces decoded scans
    on `IfcxParseResult.pointClouds`. The mesh extractor is unchanged.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser` re-exports the new `PointCloudExtraction` type.
  - `@ifc-lite/renderer` gains a WGSL `topology: 'point-list'` pipeline,
    per-asset GPU buffers, and `Renderer.setPointClouds()` /
    `Renderer.addPointClouds()`. Points share the depth buffer and section
    plane state with the triangle pipeline.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#576](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/576) [`1309f8c`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/1309f8cba128b3b6237ebfb9831bf359c426a742) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add IFC 4D / construction scheduling extractor (`extractScheduleOnDemand`).
  Parses `IfcTask`, `IfcTaskTime`, `IfcRelSequence`, `IfcRelAssignsToProcess`,
  `IfcRelAssignsToControl`, `IfcRelNests`, `IfcWorkSchedule`, `IfcWorkPlan`, and
  `IfcLagTime` from the source buffer and returns a normalized
  `ScheduleExtraction` — hierarchy, assigned products, typed dependency edges
  (FS/SS/FF/SF with `IfcLagTime` resolved to seconds), and work-schedule
  grouping — that UIs can drive a Gantt view and 4D animation from.

- [#576](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/576) [`1309f8c`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/1309f8cba128b3b6237ebfb9831bf359c426a742) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add schedule-serializer + deterministic-GlobalId helpers.

  **`serializeScheduleToStep(extraction, options)`** emits a `ScheduleExtraction`
  back into IFC-STEP lines (`IfcWorkSchedule`, `IfcWorkPlan`, `IfcTask`,
  `IfcTaskTime`, `IfcRelNests`, `IfcRelSequence`, `IfcLagTime`,
  `IfcRelAssignsToControl`, `IfcRelAssignsToProcess`), resolving cross-entity
  references by expressId and reporting per-type line counts in `stats`.
  Pairs with the existing `extractScheduleOnDemand` to make schedule data
  fully round-trippable through a STEP export.

  **`deterministicGlobalId(seed)`** — 128-bit double-FNV-1a hash encoded as a
  22-char IFC GlobalId. Deterministic (same seed ⇒ same id), collision-safe
  across schedule-generation seeds, and exposed as a single source of truth
  for every caller that previously kept a private copy of the algorithm.

### Patch Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

- [#578](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/578) [`16d7a63`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/16d7a6361a78bb39a2bd61bba6990db5d3df0c04) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Surface on-demand properties and quantities through the query API.

  `parseColumnar` intentionally leaves the pre-parsed `store.properties` / `store.quantities` tables empty and populates `onDemandPropertyMap` / `onDemandQuantityMap` instead, but `QueryResultEntity` only read from the empty pre-parsed tables. As a result `query.ofType(...).includeProperties().includeQuantities().execute()` always returned elements with empty `properties` / `quantities`, even when the IFC file contained them (issue #577).

  `loadPropertiesFromStore` / `loadQuantitiesFromStore` in `query-result-entity.ts` now fall back to `extractPropertiesOnDemand` / `extractQuantitiesOnDemand` when the pre-parsed tables are empty and the on-demand maps are present. This applies to the `properties` / `quantities` getters, the `loadProperties` / `loadQuantities` eager loaders, and the `getProperty()` accessor.

  Also normalizes untagged STEP enumeration tokens (`.T.` / `.F.` / `.U.` / `.X.`) emitted by some authoring tools in the `NominalValue` slot of `IfcPropertySingleValue`: `.T.` / `.F.` now decode to real JS booleans and `.U.` / `.X.` to a Logical `null`, matching the behavior of the conformant `IFCBOOLEAN(...)` / `IFCLOGICAL(...)` typed form.

## 2.1.9

### Patch Changes

- [#552](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/552) [`aeb5edf`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/aeb5edf89605d103582f68866c92d69ef6cb4635) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when the published packages are loaded by Node's native ESM resolver (SSR, serverless, Vitest Node mode, CI test runners, etc.).

  Several relative imports in the source omitted the `.js` extension. Under the old workspace `moduleResolution: "bundler"` TypeScript tolerated them and emitted the specifiers verbatim, so `dist/*.js` shipped extensionless relative imports. Bundlers (Vite/webpack/esbuild) resolved them transparently, but Node's native ESM resolver strictly requires the file extension and threw `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` — most visibly in `@ifc-lite/renderer`'s `dist/snap-detector.js` importing `./raycaster`.

  All offending relative imports have been rewritten to include explicit `.js` (or `/index.js` for directory imports), and every publishable package's TypeScript config now uses `module: "nodenext"` + `moduleResolution: "nodenext"` so the TypeScript compiler rejects extensionless relative imports at build time, preventing regressions. Every published package has been smoke-imported via `node --input-type=module` to verify the fix end-to-end.

  **Bug fixes:**

  - **info/diff**: Resolve "Unknown" entity type spam by using IFC_ENTITY_NAMES map for UPPERCASE→PascalCase conversion
  - **loader**: Reject non-IFC files (missing ISO-10303-21 header) and empty files with clear error messages
  - **props**: Return proper error for nonexistent entity IDs instead of empty JSON structure
  - **bcf list**: Fix empty topics by adding Map serialization support to JSON output
  - **query --where**: Fix boolean property matching (IsExternal=true now works); error on malformed syntax instead of silently returning all results
  - **query --relationships**: Add structural relationship types (VoidsElement, FillsElement, ConnectsPathElements, AssignsToGroup, etc.) to parser; handle 1-to-1 relationships
  - **query --spatial**: Fall back to IfcBuilding containment when no IfcBuildingStorey exists
  - **eval**: Support const/let/var and multi-statement expressions (auto-wraps in async IIFE)
  - **model.active().schema**: Add `schema` alias so scripts can access schema version

  **New features:**

  - **query --where operators**: Support `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `~` (contains) in addition to `=`
  - **query --sum**: Aggregate a quantity across matched entities with disambiguation warnings when similar quantities exist (e.g., `--sum GrossSideArea`)
  - **query --storey**: Filter entities by storey name (e.g., `--storey Erdgeschoss`)
  - **query --quantity-names**: List all available quantities per entity type with qset context, sample values, and ambiguity warnings — critical for LLM-driven quantity analysis
  - **query --group-by**: Pivot table grouped by type, material, or any property (e.g., `--group-by material`)
  - **query --spatial --summary**: Show element type counts per storey instead of listing every element
  - **eval**: Auto-return last expression value in multi-statement mode (no explicit `return` needed)
  - **validate**: Check quantity completeness — warns when building elements lack quantity sets
  - **--version**: Show version number in help output

- [#203](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/203) [`3823bd0`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/3823bd03bb0b5165d811cfd1ddfed671b8af97d8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add visual enhancement post-processing (contact shading, separation lines, edge contrast) and fix geometry parsing / entity type resolution

  **Renderer — visual enhancements:**

  - Add fullscreen post-processing pass (`PostProcessor`) with depth-based contact shading and object-ID-based separation lines for improved visual clarity between adjacent elements
  - Add configurable edge contrast enhancement via shader uniforms with adjustable intensity
  - New `VisualEnhancementOptions` API with independent quality presets (`off` / `low` / `high`), intensity, and radius for contact shading, separation lines, and edge contrast
  - Automatically disable expensive effects on mobile devices

  **Renderer — render pipeline changes:**

  - Add second render target (`rgba8unorm` object ID texture) to all render pipelines (opaque, transparent, overlay, instanced) for per-entity boundary detection
  - Expand vertex format from 6 to 7 floats (position + normal + entityId) across all pipelines and the picker
  - Encode entity IDs into the object ID texture via 24-bit RGB encoding in fragment shaders
  - Depth texture now created with `TEXTURE_BINDING` usage for post-processor sampling
  - Edge contrast rendering made conditional via uniform flags (`flags.z` / `flags.w`) instead of always-on

  **Renderer — geometry & scene:**

  - `GeometryManager` interleaves entity ID into the 7th float of each vertex buffer
  - `Scene` batching writes entity IDs per-vertex into merged buffers for instanced rendering

  **Data — entity type system expansion:**

  - Add ~30 new `IfcTypeEnum` entries: chimney, shading device, building element part, element assembly, reinforcing bar/mesh/tendon, discrete accessory, mechanical fastener, flow controller/moving device/storage device/treatment device/energy conversion device, duct/pipe/cable segments, furniture, proxy, annotation, transport element, civil element, geographic element
  - Add ~11 new type definition enums: pile type, member type, plate type, footing type, covering type, railing type, stair type, ramp type, roof type, curtain wall type, building element proxy type
  - Map `*StandardCase` variants (e.g. `IFCSLABSTANDARDCASE`, `IFCCOLUMNSTANDARDCASE`) to their base enum values for correct grouping
  - Expand `TYPE_STRING_TO_ENUM` and `TYPE_ENUM_TO_STRING` maps with all new types
  - Add new `ifc-entity-names.ts` with 888-line UPPERCASE → PascalCase lookup table (all IFC4X3 entity names) for correct display of any IFC entity type
  - Add `rawTypeName` field to `EntityTableBuilder` storing normalized type name as string index
  - `getTypeName()` now falls back to `rawTypeName` for types not in the enum, eliminating "Unknown" display for valid IFC types

  **Parser:**

  - Add diagnostic `console.debug` logging for spatial entity extraction and `console.warn` on extraction failures

  **WASM / Rust geometry engine:**

  - Replace overly broad geometry entity filter (`starts_with("IFC") && !ends_with("TYPE") && ...`) with explicit whitelist of ~120 IfcProduct subtypes in `has_geometry_by_name`, preventing non-product entities (e.g. `IfcDimensionalExponents`, `IfcSurfaceStyleRendering`) from being sent to geometry processing
  - Add `SolidModel` to the accepted representation types in the geometry router (6 match arms)
  - Use smooth per-vertex normals for extruded circular profiles (cylinder side walls) with `is_approximately_circular_profile` heuristic that detects circular vs polygonal profiles by coefficient of variation of radii from centroid
  - Increase circle tessellation from 24 to 36 segments for profiles (circle, circle hollow, trimmed curve, ellipse)
  - Increase swept disk solid tube segments from 12 to 24 for smoother pipes
  - Fix `PolygonalFaceSet` processing: generate flat-shaded meshes with per-face normals via `build_flat_shaded_mesh` and fix closed-shell winding orientation via `orient_closed_shell_outward`
  - Improve geometry extraction statistics: separate "no representation" (expected) from actual processing failures in diagnostic logging
  - Add `console.debug` logging for entities skipped due to missing representation

  **Viewer app:**

  - Add visual enhancement state to Zustand UI slice with 10 configurable properties (enabled, edge contrast enabled/intensity, contact shading quality/intensity/radius, separation lines enabled/quality/intensity/radius)
  - Wire `VisualEnhancementOptions` through `Viewport`, `useAnimationLoop`, and `useRenderUpdates` via memoized ref pattern
  - Show IFC type name instead of "Unknown" for spatial entities with generic names in the tree hierarchy
  - Expand `useThemeState` hook with all visual enhancement selectors

  - On-demand document extraction from IfcRelAssociatesDocument with DocumentReference→DocumentInformation chain
  - Type-level property merging: properties from IfcTypeObject HasPropertySets merged with instance properties
  - Structural relationship display: openings, fills, groups, and connections

  - Lists: add on-demand attribute extraction fallback with per-provider caching for Description, ObjectType, and Tag columns that were previously always empty
  - Property panel: show ALL string/enum IFC attributes dynamically using the schema registry (Name, Description, ObjectType, Tag, PredefinedType, etc.) instead of hardcoding only Name/Description/ObjectType
  - Parser: add `extractAllEntityAttributes()` for schema-aware full attribute extraction, extend `extractEntityAttributesOnDemand()` to include Tag (IfcElement index 7)
  - Query: add `EntityNode.tag` getter and `EntityNode.allAttributes()` method for comprehensive attribute access
