/**
 * Issue #3395: `setEntityIndex` must put the pre-pass's refusal count ON the
 * `set-entity-index` message, on both delivery paths.
 *
 * The geometry pre-pass counts the records it refused for an express id above
 * the u32 bound, and `scanIfcEntities` reports them — but only if the number
 * survives the postMessage between them. It is an optional field on the
 * message, so dropping it is silent: the parse still succeeds, still returns
 * a store, and `oversizedIdCount` reads 0, which is exactly what a clean file
 * looks like. Typecheck cannot see the difference; this can.
 *
 * The queued path matters as much as the live one: `onEntityIndex` can fire
 * before `parseColumnar` has spawned the worker, and that branch rebuilds the
 * payload by hand rather than forwarding the original message.
 *
 * Installs a global `Worker`, so it lives in its own file — see the header of
 * `worker-parser-source-sharing.test.ts` for why that must not leak.

 * the caller N records, this costs it every record after the byte the scan
 * stopped at. And it is just as silent -- an optional field on the same
 * message, so a `setEntityIndex` that forwards four arguments instead of five
 * still parses, still returns a store, and still reports a clean load.
 *
 * Both paths are covered for the reason the sibling above gives: the queued
 * branch rebuilds the payload by hand rather than forwarding the original.
