/**
 * Package-level coverage for the IFCX-only branch of
 * `extractGroupMembersOnDemand` (#1622 IFCX follow-up):
 *
 *   // IFCX stores ingest with an EMPTY entityIndex.byId (no STEP byte spans
 *   // exist), so existence rides the EntityTable there: keep a member when
 *   // EITHER source knows the id. STEP stores keep byId as the primary gate
 *   // and resolve identically to before (#1622 IFCX follow-up).
 *   if (!ref && (!tableType || tableType === 'Unknown')) continue;
 *
 * Every other `packages/parser` test reaches this function via the STEP
 * ingestion path, where `entityIndex.byId` is always populated, so the
 * `!ref` half of the guard alone would satisfy every one of them — the
 * "EITHER source" half is otherwise verified only one package over, in
 * `packages/ifcx`'s `system-membership.test.ts`. This test builds a store
 * shaped like real IFCX ingest (`entityIndex.byId` missing the member id,
 * `store.entities.getTypeName` still resolving it) so the invariant is
 * pinned locally too.
