/**
 * `scanEntitiesInWorker` spawns a `Worker`, then calls `worker.postMessage`
 * to send it the buffer. Both were inside one try whose catch only had
 * `reject(err)` — since `worker` was declared with `const` INSIDE the try,
 * the catch block could not see it, so a worker that was successfully
 * constructed but failed on `postMessage` (e.g. a `DataCloneError` from an
 * already-detached ArrayBuffer, or a clone failure under memory pressure on
 * a large file) was never terminated: a leaked worker per failed scan.
 *
 * Same shape as the two confirmed leaks in `collab/session.ts` and
 * `collab-server/room-manager.ts`: a disposable resource is acquired, a
 * fallible step runs after it, and the failure path never receives (or, here,
 * never RETAINS) a handle to what it already holds.
