/**
 * How an occurrence's own property sets compose with the ones it inherits from

 *
 * Its own module rather than a corner of `on-demand-extractors.ts`: the rule is
 * independent of how either side was extracted, and every consumer that resolves
 * properties for an occurrence needs the same answer.
 */

/**
 * Minimal shape the type/occurrence property merge needs. `properties` is
 * `readonly` so consumers whose own type declares it as a `ReadonlyArray`
 * (`@ifc-lite/lens`'s `PropertySetInfo`) still satisfy the constraint and
 * infer their own element type rather than falling back to this one.

/**
 * Compose an occurrence's own property sets with those it inherits from its
 * `IfcTypeProduct`, the way IFC defines the inheritance: **per property, not
 * per property set**.
 *
 * An occurrence and its type routinely both carry a set of the same name —
 * `Pset_CoveringCommon` holding `IsExternal`/`Reference` on the occurrence and
 * `SurfaceSpreadOfFlame`/`Combustible` on the type is a plain Revit export.
 * Dropping the whole inherited set on a name collision makes every type-only
 * property in it invisible, which is what made IDS report a present property as
 * missing (#1913). Where both define the same property name, the occurrence
 * wins — it is the more specific definition.
 *
 * An occurrence may carry **several** sets of one name (one per
 * `IfcRelDefinesByProperties`; nothing dedupes them, and merged/federated
 * exports produce them). Inherited properties are merged into *every* one of
 * them, not just the first: IDS requires every set matching the facet's
 * `propertySet` constraint to satisfy it, so augmenting one and leaving its
 * twin bare would reintroduce the same false "not found" this rule exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Neither input is mutated: a set that gains inherited properties is returned
 * as a new object, so cached extractor results stay intact.
