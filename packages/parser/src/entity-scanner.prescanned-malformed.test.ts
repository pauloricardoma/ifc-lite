/**
 * Issue #3790: the browser's sharded pre-pass is the load path a large model
 * takes, and it hands the parser worker a finished entity index instead of
 * letting it scan. #3695 made a malformed-record stop reportable on the paths
 * that scan (`worker`, `tokenizer`); on the `pre-scanned` path there is
 * nothing left to observe -- the record that stopped the scan, and every record
 * after it, is simply absent from the columns. So the flag has to travel WITH
 * the columns, exactly like `oversizedIdCount` (#3395) does, or the viewer
 * shows a model missing its tail and says the load went fine.
 *
 * These tests mock the handoff rather than the pre-pass: the producer is Rust
 * behind a worker, and what this side owns is "given a producer that reports a
 * stop, does the diagnostic reach the caller".
