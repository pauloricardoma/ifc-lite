// ISO 10303-21 lexical skipping for the byte-level scanners: comments, and the
// string literals that must not be mistaken for them.
//
// Written as line comments, not a JSDoc block, so the delimiters below can be
// spelled literally. Escaping them with a zero-width space to survive a block
// comment puts invisible Unicode in the one place that explains how comment
// termination works, and anyone copying the example into a fixture then gets a
// string that is not a valid terminator.

const SLASH = 0x2f; // '/'
const STAR = 0x2a; // '*'
const NEWLINE = 0x0a; // '\n'
const QUOTE = 0x27; // '\''

// Whether a comment opens at `pos`.
export function opensComment(buf: Uint8Array, pos: number, len: number): boolean {
  return buf[pos] === SLASH && pos + 1 < len && buf[pos + 1] === STAR;
}

// Index just past the */ closing the comment that opens at `pos`, or -1 when it
// is never closed.
//
// A STEP comment can contain anything, including a complete entity record. That
// is not hypothetical: files ship elements commented out for a revision, and
// such a record is well-formed, so every downstream shape check accepts it. The
// guard added in #856 requires a #<digits> to be followed by '=', which rejects
// a bare #1 in prose and cannot reject a commented-out record, because that
// record has its '='. The region has to be skipped as a region.
//
// Nesting is not supported, and must not be: ISO 10303-21 comments do not nest,
// so the first */ closes the comment, and treating an inner /* as a new level
// would swallow live records after it.
//
// This function is not string-aware and must not be called from inside a
// string literal. Callers skip literals with skipStringLiteral first, which is
// what keeps a /* inside a HEADER description from opening a comment.
//
// Known, shared with the Rust EntityScanner, and deliberately NOT fixed here:
// ISO 10303-21 allows a comment anywhere whitespace is allowed, and none of the
// scanners treat one as trivia *within* a record. Two shapes, both pre-existing
// and both unchanged by this file:
//
//   #1 /* note */ = IFCWALL();        header: fails the '=' check, no record
//   #1=IFCWALL('a', /* n; */ $);      body: ends early at the ';' in the comment
//
// That is true of scanEntities, of scanEntitiesFast, of the worker scanner, and
// of the Rust side, whose next_entity wants '=' straight after the digits and
// whose find_entity_end jumps to the next quote or semicolon with memchr2.
// Correcting it on the TypeScript side alone would put the JS fallback and the
// wasm scan at odds on well-formed files, so it wants one change across all
// four loops rather than a partial one here. Separate defect.
//
// The literal skip above is a smaller version of the same tension and is worth
// naming rather than hiding. Rust has no literal skip outside a record, so on a
// malformed file carrying an unpaired quote in DATA the two now disagree: this
// consumes to the next quote, Rust does not. Accepted because it only affects
// files that are already malformed, and it fails in the same direction as the
// unterminated-comment rule. Worth giving the Rust scanner the same skip.

  return -1;
}

// Index just past the closing quote of the literal opening at `pos`, or `len`
// when it never closes. A doubled '' is an escaped quote and stays inside.
//
// Scanners consume a literal whole so nothing inside it can be mistaken for
// syntax. Without this, a HEADER description reading `'rev /* pending'` opens a
// comment that never closes, and the scanner drops the entire DATA section of
// a legal file. A `#12=` inside such a string was equally readable as a record.
// The outer loops walk HEADER records byte by byte, since those carry no `#` to
// consume them, so HEADER is exactly where this bites.
