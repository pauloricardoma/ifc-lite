 * self-contained concern (spatial-graph traversal) that {@link
 * resolveEntityLengthUnitScale} in unit-extractor.ts composes with unit
 * extraction, but does not itself need any of unit-extractor.ts's unit
 * tables or IFCUNITASSIGNMENT parsing.

/**
 * Resolve the express id of the `IFCPROJECT` that owns `expressId`, for files
 * that legitimately contain more than one `IFCPROJECT` — the shape
 * `MergedExporter`'s documented `auto` unit-reconciliation mode produces for
 * a federated merge of differently-unit'd models (see issue #1332). An
 * ordinary IFC file has exactly one `IFCPROJECT` by EXPRESS invariant, so
 * this is a no-op fast path there.
 *
 * `extractLengthUnitScale`/`extractProjectUnits` resolve the file's FIRST
 * `IFCPROJECT` only unless given an explicit `projectId`; every entity
 * belonging to a LATER project in a multi-project file was silently read
 * against the first project's units. Callers needing per-entity correctness
 * (both {@link resolveEntityLengthUnitScale} in unit-extractor.ts and
 * `@ifc-lite/ids`'s area/volume resolution, which needs the project id
 * itself rather than just a length scale) resolve this id first and pass it
 * on to `extractLengthUnitScale`/`extractProjectUnits`'s `projectId`
 * parameter.
 *
 * Walks the entity's real spatial containment up to its own project:
 * `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` (element → structure), then
 * `IfcRelAggregates` (child → parent, repeated to the project), with an
 * `IfcRelDefinesByType` (type → one of the objects it defines) hop for a
 * type entity that has no containment of its own. Containment is tried
 * first since it's the one-hop case for the common "element straight into
 * its storey" shape.
 *
 * @returns The owning project's express id, or `undefined` when the file has
 *   zero or one `IFCPROJECT` (nothing to resolve) or the walk can't reach one
 *   (e.g. a resource-level entity with no containment, a cyclic/malformed
 *   graph). Callers should fall back to the file's default project on
 *   `undefined`, matching prior single-project behaviour.
