/**
 * Schema-derived relationship attribute slots (#4205).
 *
 * `extractRelFast` (`columnar-parser-relationships.ts`) used to dispatch on a
 * hand-written `typeUpper === 'IFCREL...'` ladder, one branch per STEP
 * keyword, each hardcoding which attribute index carried `RelatingX` and
 * which carried `RelatedY`. Every `IfcRelationship` subtype not in that
 * ladder fell through to a "default" branch that assumed positions 4/5 —
 * wrong for several real subtypes — or was never routed to `extractRelFast`
 * at all (the hand-written gate sets in `columnar-parser-indexes.ts`).
 *
 * This module derives the same information from the codegen-generated
 * schema registries instead: EXPRESS `IfcRelationship` subtypes normally
 * name their two graph-relevant attributes `RelatingX` (a single reference)
 * and `RelatedY` (a single reference or a list). IFC2X3 IfcRelCoversSpaces
 * predates that naming pair but still declares two ordered reference slots,
 * which the same schema walk can derive. Walking
 * `allAttributes` (root → leaf, the same order the STEP file writes them
 * in) and picking out the first `Relating*`/`Related*` attribute whose
 * EXPRESS type is an entity or a select (never an enum or a defined
 * primitive type — `IfcRelConnectsPathElements.RelatingPriorities` is an
 * `IfcInteger` LIST and `RelatingConnectionType` an enum; neither is a
 * reference) gives the exact byte position to scan to, for every subtype
 * across every bundled schema version, without a per-type table.

 *  of whose alternatives is a defined TYPE that is itself an aggregate.
 *
 *  `IfcRelDefinesByProperties.RelatingPropertyDefinition` is the
 *  motivating case: typed `IfcPropertySetDefinitionSelect = SELECT
 *  (IfcPropertySetDefinition, IfcPropertySetDefinitionSet)`, and
 *  `IfcPropertySetDefinitionSet` is `TYPE ... = SET [1:?] OF
 *  IfcPropertySetDefinition` — a defined type, not an entity, so a value
 *  of that alternative is written inline as `(#20,#21)` with no entity
 *  line of its own. `attr.isList` is false here (the ATTRIBUTE is not
 *  declared as a list — only one alternative of its select is), so it
 *  alone cannot see this. Recurses through nested selects (depth-capped)
 *  since a select's alternatives can themselves be selects.
 *
 *  Same order-of-checks trap as {@link isReferenceType}: `registry.types`
 *  ALSO holds every select's own name (mapped to its literal `SELECT (...)`
 *  source), so `registry.selects` must be checked first or a select name
 *  passed in here would resolve against its own entry in `.types` instead
