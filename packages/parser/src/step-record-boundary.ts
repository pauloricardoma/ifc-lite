/**
 * Where one STEP record ends, and whether a given `;` is its own (#4179).
 *
 * The TypeScript half of the rule argued in `close_step_record` in
 * rust/core/src/parser/lexical.rs. Rust is the source of truth
 * per AGENTS.md; read the two rules, the general property they approximate,
 * and why a refusal recovers rather than stops, THERE, and change the halves
 * together. `StepTokenizer.scanEntitiesFast` (tokenizer.ts) calls into here;
 * `WORKER_CODE` (scan-worker-source.ts) hand-duplicates it because a Blob
 * worker cannot import at runtime.

const QUOTE = 0x27; // '\''

const RPAREN = 0x29; // ')'
const EQUALS = 0x3D; // '='

// Byte length of the record starting at `startOffset` whose argument list
// opens at `pos`: up to and including the ')' balancing that '('.
//
// A failure is CLASSIFIED, because the two kinds call for opposite answers
// from a scan that wants to recover (#4179). UNBALANCED_RECORD: every literal
// and comment closed, so bytes after this record are readable and a caller may
// resume there. UNREADABLE_RECORD: one never closed, so everything to end of
// input is inside it and nothing can be resumed.
//
// A string literal is jumped over by skipStringLiteral rather than counted, so
// the '(' in 'Storey (Level 1)' is text and not depth, and STEP's doubled-quote
// escape ('') stays inside the literal instead of closing it. Sharing that
// helper keeps the escape rule in one place: an open-coded `inString` flag here
// would be a second copy, free to drift from the one every other scanner uses.
//
// A comment is jumped over for the same reason, in the same order: the literal
// test comes first, so a '/*' inside a value is text; the comment is then taken
// whole, so a '(' or a quote inside it is text. Without that, the comment in
// `#1=IFCWALL('a', /* see IFCWALL( */ $);` opened a depth that never closed.
//
// The walk STOPS at the next top-level '=' and answers UNBALANCED_RECORD
// (#4573; "Why the scan stops at the next `=`" in lexical.rs). 10303-21 has
// '=' only in `entity_instance_name '=' record`, so a ')' past one closes a
// LATER record's list, never this one's: `#1=IFCA(2 #2=IFCWALL($));`
// balanced at #2's ')' and the recovery resumed past #2, dropping it with
// nothing reported. The same stop is what bounds the walk. Without it a record
// with no ')' of its own read to end of input, the caller resumed one byte
// past its '#', and the next declaration repeated the whole walk: a file of
// `#1=A(2;` repeated measured 2.5s at 10 000 records and 10s at 20 000, 4x
// per doubling, in this scan and the Blob worker's copy alike. Stopping at
// the '=' makes each refusal cost its own record's bytes, so a file of refused
// records costs its length. A byte-window cap is not monotone (work is
// records x window, and the adversary shrinks the record), and a suffix memo
// of "no terminator from here on" is disarmed by the `ENDSEC;` every real
// file ends with; neither substitutes for the grammar rule.
