/**
 * The IFC source bytes, behind an accessor instead of a bare `Uint8Array`.
 *
 * Why this exists (#2183). `IfcDataStore.source` is the whole file, kept
 * resident for the lifetime of the model because on-demand property and
 * attribute reads slice it synchronously — during React render, in eight
 * separate chains. On a 342 MB model that is 327 MB of the ~671 MB the
 * viewer's main thread holds, and it is the single largest resident.
 *
 * The contract "here are all the bytes, contiguous, resident forever" is what
 * blocks any cheaper representation. Replacing it with "ask for the range you
 * need" makes every whole-file consumer visible, which is a property you
 * cannot retrofit later, and it is the precondition for storing the source
 * compressed in blocks.
 *
 * The accessor starts resident (`slice` is a `subarray`, no copy) and can
 * switch to block-compressed storage IN PLACE via `compressInPlace`. See
 * {@link MutableSourceBytes} for why in place rather than by replacement --
 * that detail is the difference between a real saving and a silent no-op.
 *
 * Design notes that are load-bearing rather than stylistic:
 *
 *   - `length` is an alias of `byteLength`. It exists so the ~79 existing
 *     `!store.source?.length` guards keep compiling AND keep meaning exactly
 *     what they mean today. Two of them are semantic discriminators, not
 *     defensive noise: `packages/ids/src/bridge/properties.ts` uses
 *     source-presence to mean "WASM store, not server store", and
 *     `material-resolver.ts` uses it to decide cache safety. Do not add new
 *     uses; prefer `byteLength`.
 *   - `byteLength === 0` is a real, supported state, not an error. Server
 *     parsed stores, synthetic stores, GLB and point-cloud models all have no
 *     source. {@link EMPTY_SOURCE_BYTES} models it.
 *   - `contentKey` is computed lazily and memoised. It replaces two
 *     hand-rolled hashes in the viewer, one of which walks the whole file on
 *     every call and one of which keys a cache on `byteLength` alone (and so
 *     collides across same-size models).
