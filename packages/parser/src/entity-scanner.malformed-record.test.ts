/**
 * A quoted string that opens (an unescaped `'`) but never closes leaves the
 * "skip to the next `;`" scan with no terminator to find for that record —
 * and, before this fix, no way back either: the scan just ran to
 * end-of-buffer and stopped, silently reporting whatever it had found so
 * far as a complete, successful result.
 *
 * The same shape of bug as #3395 (an oversized express id refused with no
 * signal), but worse in effect: that one drops a single record, this one
 * used to drop everything after it too. Real-world triggers include a file
 * truncated mid-string (by a bad download or a failed export) and a single
 * corrupted record from a lossy round-trip through another tool.
