 *   suppress the repeat as if it were a cycle and report one load where the
 *   file applies two.
 * - a **depth cap** bounds one chain's length, which the cycle set alone does
 *   not for a long acyclic chain.
 * - a **node budget** bounds total work. The first two still admit `k`
 *   children each recursing `k` deep, which is O(k^depth) — an abort turned
 *   into a hang, and a hang reports nothing.
 *
 * All three bounds, and every reference this reader cannot follow for the
 * file's own reasons, keep the `Values` slot they gave up on: the slot becomes
 * an entry with no `value` and a `dropped` reason naming which it was, so
 * the station a `Locations` row names still belongs to the load the file put
 * there. Only the three bounds set `truncated`, since only they mean the file
 * holds more than this reader agreed to walk.
