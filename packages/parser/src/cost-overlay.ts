/**
 * The pending-mutation overlay the cost read model reads THROUGH (#4857).
 *
 * `extractCostOnDemand` reads a loaded model's cost graph straight out of the
 * source bytes. A loaded model, though, also carries an edit overlay — the
 * viewer's `MutablePropertyView` — that the STEP exporter applies on the way
 * out. Without this module the two disagree: rename an `IfcCostItem` in a
 * loaded model and `bim.cost.data()` still reports the on-disk name while
 * `bim.export.ifc()` writes the new one.
 *
 * WHERE THIS IS APPLIED, AND WHY THERE
 *
 * At `CostEntityReader` — the single funnel every cost extractor reads an
 * entity through (`ids`, `get`, `typeOf`, `attributeLexeme`) — and nowhere
 * else. Projecting the overlay onto the finished `CostGraphExtraction`
 * instead would mean re-deriving nesting parents, child lists, controlling
 * schedules, compatibility value trees, unit resolution and every diagnostic
 * a second time, from a second implementation. Applied at the reader, the
 * whole of that derivation recomputes itself from one path, and an overlaid
 * model reads EXACTLY as a file that literally stated those values would.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate and is the safe-delete answer: a cost value
 * deleted while an `IfcCostItem` still lists it in `CostValues` reads back as
 * a `MISSING_REFERENCE` **error** diagnostic against that item — the same
 * answer the reader already gives for a file with a genuinely dangling
 * reference.
 *
 * WHY THE OVERLAY HANDS OVER RECORD TEXT, NOT EDITS
 *
 * What an edit becomes in the file is the exporter's decision: an enum slot
 * is written `.ADD.`, a string slot `'ADD'`, a REAL slot refuses a non-number,
 * a positional value is SELECT-qualified, a retype re-lays-out the argument
 * list, and a slot past the end of a truncated record is skipped. A parser-
 * side copy of those rules is a second implementation that drifts — the first
 * version of this overlay quoted every value, so an `ArithmeticOperator` edit
 * read as absent while export wrote `.ADD.`. So the overlay returns the record
 * as `@ifc-lite/export`'s `effectiveSourceRecord` writes it, and the reader
 * parses that text exactly as it parses the file.
 */

/**
 * A loaded model's pending edits, as the cost read model observes them. The
 * SDK builds one from a `MutablePropertyView` over `@ifc-lite/export`'s
 * `effectiveSourceRecord`. `created` is optional for backwards compatibility
 * with overlays compiled against the pre-authoring contract; omitting it
 * means that the overlay has no created entities to project.

   * it, so a freshly authored `IfcCostItem` reads through `bim.cost` exactly
   * as the file that will be exported would state it — before the model is
   * ever exported.
   *
   * A created entity the overlay later tombstoned is never in this list:
