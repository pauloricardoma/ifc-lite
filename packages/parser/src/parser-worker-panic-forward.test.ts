/**
 * #2527 follow-up: pins that `parser.worker.ts` itself reads + consumes ITS
 * OWN realm's wasm panic-location stash and includes it on the
 * `{type:'error'}` message it posts back — the half of the fix
 * `worker-parser-panic-forward.test.ts` cannot see, since that fixture
 * drives `WorkerParser` with a fully synthetic `Worker` and never runs a
 * line of this file.
 *
 * `parser.worker.ts` assigns `self.onmessage = ...` at module scope, which
 * needs a `self` global — absent under vitest's default Node environment. A
 * minimal `self`/`postMessage` polyfill is installed BEFORE the dynamic
 * import so the module loads exactly as it would in a real worker realm.
