/**
 * #2527 follow-up: pins that `parser.worker.ts` itself reads + consumes ITS
 * OWN realm's wasm panic-location stash and includes it on the
 * `{type:'error'}` message it posts back — the half of the fix
 * `worker-parser-panic-forward.test.ts` cannot see, since that fixture
 * drives `WorkerParser` with a fully synthetic `Worker` and never runs a
 * line of this file.
 *
 * `parser.worker.ts` assigns `self.onmessage = ...` at module scope, which
 * needs a `self` global — absent under vitest's default Node environment. A
 * minimal `self`/`postMessage` polyfill is installed BEFORE the dynamic
 * import so the module loads exactly as it would in a real worker realm.

 * #2948: the dynamic import below pays a real transform cost — the FIRST
 * `beforeEach` in this file loads `parser.worker.js` for the first time and
 * vitest/vite must parse+transform it and its import graph, a one-time cost
 * that later `?t=N` cache-busted imports of the same underlying file reuse
 * (measured: first test 1111ms, second test 4ms, same machine, same run).
 * On a green CI run that first hook was measured at 4462ms.
 *
 * That number does NOT threaten `testTimeout` (5000ms default): the import
 * runs inside `beforeEach`, and vitest starts each test's own timeout clock
 * only once its hooks have resolved — confirmed by probe, a `beforeEach`
 * that alone takes 5.8s passes under the default 5000ms `testTimeout`. The
 * real ceiling here is `hookTimeout` (10_000ms default), against which
 * 4462ms is 45%, not the 89% headline number would suggest against 5000ms.
 * Made explicit anyway, at the repo's usual order of magnitude for a
 * genuinely slow but non-scaling one-time cost, so the budget is a decision
 * rather than an artifact of which default vitest happens to apply here.
