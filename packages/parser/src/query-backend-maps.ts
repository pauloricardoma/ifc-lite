 * `query-adapter`, `@ifc-lite/cli`'s `HeadlessBackend`, and `@ifc-lite/mcp`'s
 * `backend-query` — and each carried its own byte-identical copy of the two
 * tables below. Only the CLI copy had tests, so editing either of the other
 * two changed what `byType()` or `related()` answered on that surface alone,
 * with nothing failing: dropping `IFCSLABELEMENTEDCASE` from the MCP copy left
 * all 272 of its tests green. Three answers to one question is one answer too
 * many, so the tables live here, next to the `entityIndex` whose key shape

/**
 * Expand a caller's type list to every schema-declared descendant (itself
 * plus every type that has it as an ancestor, direct or indirect), so
 * `byType('IfcBuildingElement')` finds the concrete leaves a model actually
 * contains instead of matching nothing — `IfcBuildingElement`/`IfcElement`
 * are abstract EXPRESS supertypes, never a literal STEP entity type, so a
 * caller asking for one always meant its subtypes.
 *
 * Delegates to `@ifc-lite/data`'s `expandTypeNamesToDescendants`, the single
 * schema-authority resolver every `byType()` backend now shares — this used
 * to be a fixed nine-entry `IFC_SUBTYPES` table (still above, unused here)
 * that only aliased `*StandardCase`/`*ElementedCase` pairs and silently
 * dropped every abstract-supertype query.
 *
 * PASS `schemaVersion`. It is the queried model's own `store.schemaVersion`,
 * and it is what makes the answer exact. Descendant sets are not the same
 * across versions -- buildingSMART re-parented entities, so
 * `IfcReinforcingBar` is an `IfcBuildingElement` in IFC2X3 and an
 * `IfcElementComponent` in IFC4 -- while the names a FILE contains need not
 * belong to the version its header claims. The resolver reconciles the two;
 * see its module doc for the exact rule.
 *
 * It is optional only because this function is a published export of
 * `@ifc-lite/parser` and of `@ifc-lite/mcp/browser`, and requiring it would
 * stop an existing `expandTypes(['IfcWall'])` compiling -- a major, which a
 * bug-fix release is not. Omitted, the expansion falls back to the UNION
 * across the three bundled schemas: a superset that finds every spelling but
 * cannot tell a re-parented entity from a real subtype, so
 * `expandTypes(['IfcBuildingElement'])` answers with reinforcing bars that
 * `expandTypes(['IfcBuildingElement'], 'IFC4')` correctly leaves out. Every
 * caller in this repository passes the version; a viewer test goes red if one
 * stops.
 *
 * The expansion does not cross an `IfcRoot` branch. Descending the whole
 * hierarchy from an abstract root turned `byType('IfcRoot')` into "every
 * rooted record in the file" — 223 rows on `infra-bridge.ifc`, 36 of them
 * `IfcRelDefinesByProperties` — which a caller then hands to `storey()` or
 * `group_by`, written against products. `IfcObjectDefinition` swept in every
 * `*Type` the same way, contradicting the untyped branch of the very same
 * backends, which has always answered with {@link isQueryableObjectType}
 * only.
 *
 * The gate reads the requested type's branch rather than "is a product",
 * because `byType('IfcBuildingElementType')` means its subtypes exactly as
 * much as `byType('IfcBuildingElement')` does. The requested names themselves
 * are never gated: a caller who spells out `IfcPropertySet` said what they
 * wanted.
 *
 * Memoized on (schemaVersion, type list). Every `byType()` call goes through
 * here, and `validate` now calls it twice per store; the closure plus the gate
 * cost 0.78 ms for `IfcRoot` on IFC4, which the caches take to a Map lookup.
 * The key keeps the caller's order rather than sorting it: the output order is
 * contractual — each requested type ahead of its own descendants — so two
 * different orders are two different answers and must not share an entry.
