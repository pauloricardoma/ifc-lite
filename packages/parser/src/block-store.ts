/**
 * Block-compressed backing store for {@link IfcSourceBytes} (#2183).
 *
 * The source is the whole IFC file, resident for the model's lifetime because
 * property and attribute reads slice it synchronously during React render. On
 * a 342 MB model that is 327 MB of the viewer's main-thread heap. Deflating it
 * into fixed-size blocks and inflating on demand trades that for ~67 MB plus a
 * small cache.
 *
 * The numbers this design is built on, measured with fflate 0.8.3 on the real
 * 342.7 MB model rather than assumed:
 *
 *   - 64 KiB blocks at level 6: 342.7 MB -> 67 MB (19.7%), and an inflate costs
 *     0.18 ms p50 / 0.40 ms max. 256 KiB stores 3 MB less but triples the p50
 *     to 0.69 ms, which is the wrong trade for a synchronous read on the render
 *     path. 16 KiB gives back 10 MB for latency nothing needs.
 *   - A full per-entity sweep touches 5161 of 5229 blocks -- essentially each
 *     block exactly once -- because expressId order tracks byte offset in STEP.
 *     It is a sequential scan, not a thrash, so cache CAPACITY barely matters:
 *     32 MB and 256 MB are within 7% of each other. The cache is sized for the
 *     interactive working set, not to chase a hit rate.
 *   - Reusing evicted buffers is worth ~13% on a sweep (1.73 -> 1.53 s). Real
 *     but not load-bearing: inflate itself dominates, so the pool stays small
 *     and simple and is never allowed to justify complexity.
