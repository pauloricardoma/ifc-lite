/**
 * Adapt a parsed store (an `IfcDataStore` from `@ifc-lite/parser`, or
 * anything else matching {@link ParsedIfcStore}) into the {@link
 * CacheDataStore} shape {@link BinaryCacheWriter.write} requires. This is the
 * conversion the `@ifc-lite/cache` README's quickstart needs and previously
 * didn't show — `parseColumnar`'s return type and `write`'s parameter type
 * differ in the `schema`/`schemaVersion` key and its string-vs-enum
 * representation, so passing a parsed store straight to `write` doesn't
 * typecheck (issue #3759).
 *
 * The one thing this does NOT do is materialize `properties`/`quantities`.
 * For a STEP-parsed store those tables are empty by design — properties
 * resolve lazily on demand — and this adapter serializes exactly what the
 * store carries, so a cache written from a STEP parse has an empty
 * property/quantity table too. See the `@ifc-lite/cache` package docs and
 * `docs/guide/querying.md` for what that means for a cache-restored model.
 *
 * `entityCount` falls back to `entities.count` when the store leaves it at 0.
 * It is a header field the reader hands straight back to callers, and the
 * viewer's write path carried this fallback inline before it moved onto this
 * adapter. One difference from that inline copy, deliberately: it read
 * `entities?.count || 0`, so a store carrying no `entities` at all still
 * wrote a header claiming 0 entities. `entities` is required on
 * {@link ParsedIfcStore} and a store without it cannot be serialized in any
 * case, so this throws there instead of writing a plausible wrong count.
 *
 * The entity index IS carried over: `store.entityIndex` already satisfies
 * {@link CacheEntityIndex} structurally, so dropping it only cost callers the
 * section (and with it the ability to re-attach lazy accessors on read, which
 * is the very remedy the README recommends for the empty property tables).
