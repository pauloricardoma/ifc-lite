/**
 * Moved out of the viewer into `@ifc-lite/cache` (#5138 PR 7b review) so a
 * headless caller (the CLI, the MCP server) can compute the SAME
 * `EvaluatorModel.filterIdentity` the viewer stores as
 * `FederatedModel.sourceFingerprint` — a rule set's `targets.modelFingerprints`
 * only resolves against a model when both sides hash it identically.
 *
 * Spread-sampled source fingerprint — a fast, strong cache KEY, NOT a full
 * content validation. `buildGeometryCacheKey` (viewer, `hooks/geometryCacheKey.ts`)
 * folds {@link SourceFingerprint.hex} into the key so the RIGHT entry is
 * looked up; it replaces the old
 * first-4KB+last-4KB FNV-32 fingerprint (32 bits, interior-blind) with a wider
 * 64-bit hash over a head/tail/interior spread plus the exact byte length.
 *
 * ## O(1) sampler — and its deliberate blind spot
 * It touches a FIXED ~160KB spread regardless of file size (head {@link
 * HEAD_TAIL_BYTES} + tail {@link HEAD_TAIL_BYTES} + {@link INTERIOR_WINDOWS}
 * interior windows + the 8-byte length), so it is sub-millisecond even on a
 * 400MB file. That O(1) speed is exactly why it CANNOT be the validation: it
 * never reads the bytes BETWEEN its sample windows. A byte-length-preserving
 * in-place edit that lands in a gap — a GUID patch (GUIDs are a fixed 22 chars),
 * a scripted same-width coordinate/string edit — produces an IDENTICAL
 * fingerprint. For the source-PERSISTING tier that is harmless (it serves cached
 * geometry AND cached source together — self-consistent), but for the
 * source-DECOUPLED (mesh-only) tier, which hydrates cached geometry against the
 * FRESH buffer, an unvalidated gap-edit hit would be a silent chimera (old
 * geometry + new properties).
 *
 * ## Validation lives elsewhere — NOT in this fingerprint
 * A mesh-only hit is validated by the source File's `lastModified` (mtime guard:
 * any real on-disk edit bumps it → safe miss) plus a TRUE full-file content hash
 * (SHA-256, computed off the main thread and re-checked in the background to
 * catch the deliberate mtime-preserving gap edit → purge + reload). See the
 * viewer's `hooks/cacheTier.ts` `decideMeshOnlyCacheHit`, `utils/sourceContentHash.ts`,
 * and `hooks/useIfcLoader.ts`. This fingerprint's only job is to key the
 * lookup cheaply and make a false key-hit (a genuinely different file
 * mapping to the same entry) astronomically rare, so the mtime / full-hash
 * gate almost never has to reject one. It is still strictly stronger than
 * the old weak key (proved in `source-fingerprint.test.ts`), but strength
 * of the KEY is a performance property, not the safety guarantee.
