### Patch Changes

- [#3127](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3127) [`b25b2e7`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b25b2e7387bd365fda02d48095266f16b4f05cd7) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Close a live divergence between `applyNode` and `applyNodeCow` in component-state extraction: `applyNodeCow` silently omitted the `ifclite::deleted` tombstone branch that `applyNode` has, so a `DELETED` opinion reaching it fell through into an ordinary component write instead of setting the entity's `deleted`/`explicitDeleted` flags.
  
  This was safe today only because `projectStackStates` bails to the `extractStackState` fallback (never reaching `applyNodeCow`) whenever any layer in the stack carries a `DELETED` opinion — a behavioural delta held safe by a caller's guard rather than by anything structural, and invisible through the public API.
  
  Both functions now delegate to one shared `applyNodeToEntity` core, parameterised only by whether a touched component is copied before mutation (the one real difference: `applyNodeCow`'s clone-on-write entities may still alias untouched ancestor state). No other branch can drift between the two. No public API change.

### Patch Changes

- [#2911](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2911) [`f31822b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f31822b0833e1bcd76c43736daf1d76cb3e59914) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix the three-way merge, layer diff, and revert-op paths trusting a `stableHash` component match with no fallback content check.
  
  `snapshotOf` (`component-state.ts`) hashes each component's canonical JSON with `stableHash`, and every consumer — the three-way merge's fold/keep-ours decisions, the layer diff's changed-component detection, and revert-op generation — decided "same content" from hash equality alone. `stableHash` is a 64-bit FNV-1a hash: strong, but not cryptographic, and unlike `packages/diff`'s content-match pass (which requires an independent component sub-hash or geometry-hash agreement before trusting a `dataHash` match) nothing here had a fallback. A collision would have silently folded two genuinely different concurrent edits into one — the losing edit vanishes with no conflict raised — or silently skipped reverting a component that had actually changed.
  
  `attributesContentEqual` now verifies with an exact canonical-JSON comparison whenever two hashes already agree, at negligible cost since it only runs on the (common) case of an actual match. No behavior changes for any non-colliding pair.

- [#2783](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2783) [`4d1c611`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/4d1c611b822e80a6123b040887a31cdb43c460da) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Add test coverage pinning the multi-layer suffix fold in the merge fast path.
  
  `projectSide` (`packages/merge/src/component-state.ts`) folds a side's
  suffix layers weakest-first, per attribute — same contract documented on
  `extractStackState`. That ordering was structurally unpinned: every
  `ours`/`theirs` fixture in the suite was a suffix of length exactly 1, so
  "earlier" never existed and the fold could not be observed. Reversing the
  loop left all 94 existing tests green.
  
  Adds:
  - A hand-written fixture (`component-state.test.ts`) with a two-layer
    `ours` suffix that writes the same attribute in both layers (different
    values) plus an attribute written only in the earlier layer, proving
    shadowing is per-attribute rather than wholesale replacement, and
    carrying the fold-order-dependent value into an actual
    `planThreeWayMerge` conflict.
  - A `layersPerSide` parameter on `fast-path-differential.test.ts`'s
    `scenario()` builder so the differential fuzz's fast-path-equals-
    reference proof also covers multi-layer suffixes, not only
    single-layer ones.
  
  No production code changed; `projectSide`'s existing loop order is
  correct (it already applies weakest-first) — only its test coverage was
  missing. Confirmed by reversing the loop locally: the new tests fail
  (RED) and the loop-order mutation at `component-state.ts:179`
  (`extractStackState`'s equivalent fold) still fails the expected 40
  tests across 8 files, confirming both mutation sites are exercised.
  
  Also recorded, not fixed (out of scope for this patch):
  - `merge-layer.ts:41-43` — `applyResolutions`'s `byKey` map uses
    last-insertion-wins with no test submitting two `ResolutionInput`s for
    the same `(path, componentKey)`; may be an undefined contract rather
    than a bug.
  - `ref-flow.ts:109` — `checkRefPolicy`'s `requiredChecks` loop is only
    ever exercised with a single-entry array; which failing check is
    reported first with multiple failures is unpinned (message selection
    only).

### Patch Changes

- [#2278](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2278) [`6635ddf`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6635ddfa91911b0fbc489452c02cf19e232201c3) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix `componentKeyForAttribute` silently misclassifying a custom-named (not `Pset_`/`Qto_`-prefixed) property or quantity set, breaking whole-set tombstone lookups for it, and fix a member deletion on such a set being routed to a different component than the value it targets — so the member survived the delete.

  `componentKeyForAttribute` bucketed a `bsi::ifc::v5a::<Set>::<Member>` attribute as `pset:<Set>`/`qset:<Set>` only when `<Set>` matched a literal `Pset_`/`Qto_` prefix, falling back to a one-off-per-attribute `attr:<key>` bucket for any other name. `packages/mutations/src/change-set-to-ops.ts` builds `pset:<name>`/`qset:<name>` component keys unconditionally from the mutation type, for any author-chosen name, and `@ifc-lite/collab`'s structured-attribute inflation already disambiguates a custom set name by value shape (typed record -> pset, plain finite number -> quantity) — its own doc comment describes that as a convention "the merge engine's `pset:`/`qset:` component keys... already share", which this package didn't actually hold up.

  The observable break: `apps/viewer/src/lib/layers/publish.ts`'s `buildDeltaNodes` resolves a whole-component tombstone (`DELETE_PROPERTY_SET`/`DELETE_QUANTITY_SET`) by looking up the base state's members under `pset:<name>`/`qset:<name>`. For a custom-named set, that lookup found nothing (the members lived under `attr:<key>` instead), so zero attributes were nulled — deleting a custom-named property set silently did nothing at all, no error, no diagnostic.

  `componentKeyForAttribute` now takes the attribute's value and disambiguates a custom set name by the same shape rule `@ifc-lite/collab` uses. A `null` value (an in-flight single-member deletion, as opposed to a whole-component tombstone) still carries no shape to go on, so that path is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- [#1987](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1987) [`ed63063`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ed63063c952bd1804ce83922da80635f03c77193) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **diff**: widen `stableHash` from 32-bit to 64-bit FNV-1a (offset basis `0xcbf29ce484222325`, prime `0x100000001b3`, the same offset basis and prime as `rust/processing/src/determinism.rs`, though not byte-compatible with it: this walks UTF-16 code units and the Rust side hashes bytes, so only ASCII input agrees). Output is now 16 zero-padded lowercase hex chars instead of up to 8.

  `matchUnpairedByContent` treats `dataHash` equality as identity — its 1:1 branch retires a real `added` and a real `deleted` — and 32 bits was too narrow for that: collisions between plausible IFC content were findable by enumeration, and exposure grows with the square of the number of fingerprints compared.

  **diff**: `buildDataFingerprint` and `buildComponentFingerprints` no longer hash the assigned type's `GlobalId`; an assigned type is now identified by its `name` and its IFC class. `IfcTypeObject` is an `IfcRoot`, so a from-scratch re-export regenerates the _type's_ GlobalId along with every product's — which changed the content hash of every _typed_ element (walls, doors, windows: most of a real model) on exactly the re-export where nothing substantive changed, and made those elements unable to content-match. `TypeAssignmentInput.globalId` is kept as a field and still accepted, it just no longer participates in any hash. The trade is a real loss of discrimination: two _different_ type entities that share a name and an IFC class now look identical, so re-pointing an element between them does not move its `dataHash`. That needs duplicate type names within one class, and only shows on elements otherwise identical in every attribute, property and quantity.

  **Every fingerprint value changes.** `stableHash`, `buildDataFingerprint`, and `buildComponentFingerprints` all return different strings for the same input than they did before. Nothing in this repo persists these values — base and head are always fingerprinted by the same build, so a normal diff or merge is unaffected — but any caller that has stored fingerprints across sessions and compares old values to new ones must recompute them. Comparing a pre-upgrade hash with a post-upgrade one reports everything as changed.

  **merge**: `snapshotOf` is built on `@ifc-lite/diff`'s `stableHash`, so the `hash` on every `ComponentSnapshot` it returns — and on the `ComponentSnapshot`s carried by `MergeConflict` — changes value with this release. Nothing about the API's shape or its equality semantics changes: two snapshots of the same attributes still hash equal, and a merge or conflict detection run entirely on this version behaves exactly as before. **Stored snapshots do not compare equal across the upgrade**: a hash persisted by an older version will not match the one this version computes for the same attributes, and any comparison that spans the two reports a spurious difference. Recompute rather than migrate. This is an explicit `minor` rather than the automatic dependency `patch` changesets would otherwise apply, because the observable output of a public export changed.

  The collision guards in `diffModels` (bucket by `ifcType`, require `components` agreement) are unchanged, as is the documented residual: a collision confined to `attr:core` still cannot be detected, because FNV-1a's per-character update is a bijection on its state at any width. `buildComponentFingerprints` deliberately drops the type's `GlobalId` too, rather than keeping it as extra collision evidence: the guard's soundness rests on components hashing slices of exactly what `dataHash` hashes whole, and a `type-assignment` sub-hash that saw the GlobalId would veto the genuine re-export matches this release enables.

Published drafts land on their home ref with a declared base equal to the composition they were authored against, which need not be representable on the ref, so re-merging them previously dead-ended. Registry merge previews now also report `ancestor_matched` so clients can warn before an execute would be refused.

  - **ifcx**: deletion-overlay tombstones (`ifclite::deleted`) with shadow/resurrect semantics and child-path shadowing in both composition engines; `bakeLayers` tombstone-free materialization; canonical serialization with blake3 content addressing (`computeLayerId`, `computeStackHash`); provenance manifest v1 (`createProvenanceManifest`, `getProvenance`/`setProvenance`, `validateProvenance`).
  - **diff**: opt-in per-componentKey sub-hash mode (`buildComponentFingerprints`) and `changedComponents` on diff entries; the whole-blob `dataHash` default is unchanged.
  - **extensions**: scope-claim grammar — capability expressions extended with entity selectors (`model.mutate:Pset_FireSafety*@IfcWall&storey=EG`), with grant-coverage and op-level enforcement matching.
  - **mutations**: `changeSetToOps` expressId→GlobalId bridge with blake3 content-derived identity fallback recorded for the manifest `identity_map`.
  - **collab**: `extractMinimalLayer` now expresses deletions (entity tombstones plus `null` removals), closing the documented additive-only deferral; new `publishLayer` freezes a draft into an immutable, content-addressed, provenance-stamped layer.
  - **merge** (new package): three-way merge engine over (entity, componentKey) states with explicit conflict records, resolution application, merge-layer emission with `manifest.merge`, revert (inverse-op layers), and rebase.

  - **merge**: the ref-merge flow (fast-forward, three-way planning, ref-policy enforcement, unrelated-base refusal) moved into `@ifc-lite/merge` as store-agnostic `mergeIntoRef`/`resolveAncestor`/`checkRefPolicy` over a `LayerRefStore` interface — the CLI and the registry run one decision procedure.
  - **collab-server**: opt-in `layerRegistry` mounts `/api/v1/layers|refs|reviews` — push with a server-side blake3 integrity gate (id recomputed, provenance validated), pull by id, refs with policies (policy-protected refs move only through the merge endpoint, where required checks and approval rules run), and review (PR) objects. Authorization derives from the websocket `authenticate` hook like the blob route: one token scheme for sync, blobs, and the registry; writes require write capability.
  - **cli**: `layer merge` now delegates to the shared flow (behavior unchanged).

- [#1027](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1027) [`6ed4de6`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6ed4de6a46100e097b41137a65e91b581df34486) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Three-way planning meets the 05 §5.7 budget: a prefix projection fast path plans two 50k-op layers over a 1M-entity model in ~0.6s (was ~11.6s). When ours/theirs extend the ancestor stack, only suffix-touched paths are folded and hashed; untouched components share references and short-circuit on reference equality. Tombstone-bearing stacks keep the reference full extraction, with a differential fuzz suite enforcing equivalence between the two paths. Adds real-model partition fuzz (hello-wall + WekaHills fixtures) and `pnpm --filter @ifc-lite/merge bench`.

- [#1027](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1027) [`6ed4de6`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6ed4de6a46100e097b41137a65e91b581df34486) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - The layer-diff JSON is now one shared contract: `diffStackStates`/`diffLayerStacks` (`StackDiff` shape, deterministically ordered) live in `@ifc-lite/merge`, and the CLI `layer diff` command and the MCP `diff_layer` tool consume the identical implementation — the two previously separate copies had already drifted on ordering. A byte-exact contract test pins the wire shape the review UI will consume.
