 * Node definitions and the registry that resolves a document's node types.
 *
 * A node is a pure description plus a `run` function that receives plain
 * values in the shape its ports declared (`item` → one value, `list` → an
 * array, `group` → a Map). The scheduler does all lifting; a node never sees
 * a `FlowData` container and never inspects the structure of its inputs.
 *
 * `H` is the host services type (in `@ifc-lite/flow-nodes`: `{ bim }`).
 * This package knows nothing about the SDK.
