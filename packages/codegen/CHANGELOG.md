### Minor Changes

- [#4218](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4218) [`b5cb19a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b5cb19ae80610107f7b3b3914efa7234dfbe4999) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Bring IFC2X3 into `@ifc-lite/codegen` ([#4202](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4202)). `packages/codegen/schemas/`
  now carries `IFC2X3_TC1.exp` (the official buildingSMART express longform
  distribution) alongside the existing IFC4 and IFC4X3 schemas, and
  `generateAll()` / `pnpm generate:ifc2x3` produce
  `packages/codegen/generated/ifc2x3/` the same way the other two do — 653
  entities, 327 types, 164 enums, 46 selects, with EXPRESS attribute types,
  optionality, enum/select domains and inheritance chains, not just attribute
  names. `scripts/check-codegen-sync.mjs` regenerates it in CI and fails the
  build if the committed copy has drifted from `IFC2X3_TC1.exp`.
  
  `IFC2X3_TC1.exp` is the first schema in this repo sourced with CRLF line
  endings; committed normalized to LF (matching the other two) because a raw
  `\r` inside a multi-line `SELECT` type's underlying-type string breaks the
  generated `schema-registry.ts`'s string literal for `tsc`. It also has 12
  `SET/LIST … OF UNIQUE` occurrences — the syntax [#4212](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4212) is filed against for
  IFC4/IFC4X3 — which the existing UNIQUE-stripping fix already handles
  correctly for this schema too (zero `UNIQUE` leaks into the generated
  output).
  
  `@ifc-lite/parser` gains `getSchemaRegistryForVersion('IFC2X3' | 'IFC4' |
  'IFC4X3')`, selecting the codegen-generated runtime registry by schema
  version. `getSchemaRegistryForVersion('IFC4')` returns the exact
  `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` object the package already exported, so every existing
  caller's answer is unchanged. The lookup throws rather than returning an
  empty registry if a version's `entities` map has zero keys, so a broken
  regeneration reads as a thrown error, never as a silently empty result.

- [#4211](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4211) [`098e241`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/098e2419cac5bd72f5524c7cddfa1b4da7971696) Thanks [@mpancera](https://github.com/mpancera)! - Expose the runtime hierarchy helpers as their own subpath,
  `@ifc-lite/codegen/schema-hierarchy`, and import them from there in the two
  runtime call sites (`lod0-generator`, the IDS classification bridge).
  
  The package root exports two things with different audiences: the generator,
  which imports `node:fs` and `node:path` because it reads `.exp` files and
  writes source, and the `isSubtypeOf` family, which is pure and is meant to be
  called at runtime against a generated `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`. Importing the second
  therefore dragged the first along. In a bundler that tree-shakes, the generator
  falls away and nothing is wrong. In a dev server that does not, it is fetched
  and evaluated, the `node:fs` stub throws at import, and the viewer never
  mounts — it cycles through boot-self-heal reloads on a blank page.
  
  `schema-hierarchy.ts` has no imports at all, so the subpath is browser-safe by
  construction rather than by convention, and the existing build already emits
  `dist/schema-hierarchy.js` and its declarations. The root entry keeps every
  export it had, so nothing that imports it today has to change.

### Patch Changes

- [#4363](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4363) [`e69c9b5`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e69c9b5ac993e672ebd1e736c2b7d3997a7ac8bc) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Normalize CRLF/lone-CR line endings before parsing an EXPRESS `.exp` schema, so a schema fetched or generated fresh on Windows no longer leaks a stray `\r` into the generated TypeScript output (which breaks `tsc` on the emitted code).

- [#4468](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4468) [`78905e6`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/78905e6866c33d97f6ee7e39e35c3f86d9121ae2) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - express-parser: strip an EXPRESS element qualifier from every aggregate shape, not only the numerically bounded one ([#4212](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4212)).
  
  `UNIQUE` and `OPTIONAL` in front of an aggregate's element type (`LIST [1:?] OF UNIQUE IfcGridAxis`) constrain the elements; they are not part of the element type name and have no TypeScript equivalent. [#3565](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/3565) dropped them in `parseNestedCollection`, but `parseAttribute` only reached that function when the aggregate carried numeric bounds. A symbolic bound (`LIST [1:Dim] OF UNIQUE X`), no bound at all (`LIST OF UNIQUE X`), or an `OPTIONAL UNIQUE` element qualifier fell to a string-replace fallback that carried the qualifier into `attr.type` verbatim, so the emitter wrote `UNIQUE X[]` into the entity interface and `type: 'UNIQUE X'` into `schema-registry.ts`, where it sits inside a string literal that no typecheck reads. Aggregate bounds are now matched loosely and only become `arrayBounds` when both ends are numeric, and every element type goes through `parseNestedCollection`.
  
  The three schemas committed in this package (IFC2X3_TC1, IFC4_ADD2_TC1, IFC4X3) use numeric bounds for all 36 of their `OF UNIQUE` occurrences (12, 11 and 13), so their regenerated output is byte identical. The fix matters for any other `.exp` fed to the CLI.

  `@ifc-lite/codegen` now ships its generated `ifc4` and `ifc4x3` bundles (`SCHEMA_REGISTRY`, entity/type/enum/select interfaces, serializers) as `@ifc-lite/codegen/ifc4` and `@ifc-lite/codegen/ifc4x3` subpath exports, and adds `isSubtypeOf` / `isSubtypeOfAny` / `isProperSubtypeOf` / `isProperSubtypeOfAny` helpers built on each bundle's `inheritanceChain`.
  
  `@ifc-lite/ids`'s `isNonRootedClassifiableResourceType` (deciding whether an entity can carry classifications via `IfcExternalReferenceRelationship`) and `@ifc-lite/export`'s LOD0 generator (excluding materials from candidate elements) now use these helpers instead of pinned `startsWith`/`endsWith`/`includes` string tests on the type name — the pattern behind three separate one-string-test-wrong-at-a-different-edge incidents in as many days.

## 1.15.12

### Patch Changes

- [#3565](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3565) [`140a6d8`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/140a6d8541224341835c98028dc75e6a5ccd605d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix the EXPRESS code generator dropping a `UNIQUE` collection constraint into
  the element type instead of stripping it.
  
  EXPRESS allows `UNIQUE` directly in front of a collection's element type
  (e.g. `LIST [1:?] OF UNIQUE IfcGridAxis`, real syntax from `IfcGrid.UAxes` in
  both `IFC4_ADD2_TC1.exp` and `IFC4X3.exp`) — it constrains the collection's
  elements, it is not part of the element type name. `parseNestedCollection`
  never stripped it, so the parsed attribute type carried the leftover keyword
  verbatim (`type: 'UNIQUE IfcGridAxis'`), and a collection nested one level
  under a `UNIQUE` (`LIST [1:?] OF UNIQUE LIST [1:2] OF IfcLengthMeasure`)
  fell through the "ends with Measure" heuristic entirely and lost an array
  dimension (`number[]` instead of `IfcLengthMeasure[][]`).
  
  Eight IFC4 attributes and two additional IFC4X3-only attributes were affected
  (`IfcTypeProduct.RepresentationMaps`, `IfcGrid.{UAxes,VAxes,WAxes}`,
  `IfcIndexedPolygonalFaceWithVoids.InnerCoordIndices`, `IfcPath.EdgeList`,
  `IfcPolyLoop.Polygon`, `IfcPropertyEnumeration.EnumerationValues`,
  `IfcPropertyTableValue.DefiningValues`, `IfcVirtualGridIntersection.IntersectingAxes`,
  `IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration.Locations`, plus IFC4X3's
  `IfcTriangulatedFaceSet.Faces` and `IfcIndexedPolygonalTextureMap.InnerTexCoordIndices`).
  `packages/codegen/generated/ifc4/entities.ts` and `generated/ifc4x3/entities.ts`
  carried the bug outright (invalid TypeScript, e.g. `UAxes: UNIQUE IfcGridAxis[];`);
  `packages/parser/src/generated/entities.ts` had it hand-patched to valid syntax
  in one prior commit without ever touching the generator, so
  `schema-registry.ts` — which carries the same attribute type as a plain
  string, so `tsc` never flagged it — kept shipping `type: 'UNIQUE IfcGridAxis'`
  as runtime metadata in every published `@ifc-lite/parser` release.
  
  Regenerated and committed `packages/codegen/generated/{ifc4,ifc4x3}/{entities,schema-registry}.ts`
  and `packages/parser/src/generated/{entities,schema-registry}.ts` to match the
  fixed generator; a fresh regeneration against the committed `.exp` schemas is
  now byte-identical to what's committed.

  `SCHEMA_REGISTRY.entities` is a plain object literal, so `in` and `obj[key]`
  both reach the prototype chain. `getEntityMetadata('constructor')` returned
  the `Object` constructor. Two exported guards were wrong as a result:
  
  - `isInstantiable('constructor')` was `true`. Its own docblock says it exists
    to stop authoring code writing an abstract class into an exported file.
  - `normalizeIfcTypeName` returned the string `"Object"` for `constructor`, and
    `undefined` for `__proto__` from a signature declaring `string`.
  
  `isKnownType('constructor')` was already `false` and is unchanged. It is worth
  naming, because the guard that reads as looser was the one answering correctly,
  and the guard documented as the strict authoring boundary was the one letting
  it through.
  
  `isKnownEntity` had the same defect and now delegates to `getEntityMetadata`
  rather than repeating the lookup.
  
  The same generator emits a second registry with the same defect, also fixed:
  `getTypeId('constructor')` returned the `Object` constructor from a signature
  declaring `number | undefined`.

### Patch Changes

- [#2852](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2852) [`3c5557b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3c5557bad1dce0d0f27166184452353fded3209c) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `generateAll()` named the IFC4X3 schema file as `IFC4X3_ADD2.exp`, but the
  schema actually shipped in `schemas/` is `IFC4X3.exp`. The function does not
  throw or exit non-zero when a named schema file is missing — it logs a
  warning and moves on — so calling `generateAll()` silently produced only the
  `ifc4/` output directory and skipped `ifc4x3/` entirely, with no error to
  signal that a whole schema had gone missing.
  
  `generateAll()` is not exercised by any script in this repo (the package.json
  `generate:ifc4x3` script calls the CLI directly with an explicit path), so the
  mismatch was invisible here, but it is exported from the package's public API
  for anyone using `@ifc-lite/codegen` as a library.
  
  Fixed the filename and added a regression test that runs `generateAll()`
  against the real `schemas/` directory and asserts both output directories are
  produced.

## 1.15.9

### Patch Changes

- [#2359](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2359) [`7ee619f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7ee619f8c6a7490982136d5677674f4f6355a568) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix two corrupted cells in the generated CRC32 lookup table (index 111 and 245), which were hand-typed literals that had silently drifted from the correct reflected CRC-32 (polynomial `0xEDB88320`) values. `packages/codegen` now renders this table from a single `buildCRC32Table()` source of truth in both its TypeScript and Rust templates instead of hand-typing a second copy, so the two cannot diverge again.

  The 256-entry `TYPE_IDS` map shipped for every named entity in the schema was never affected — those ids are computed with the correct table at generation time. The corruption only affected `crc32Hash()` / `crc32_hash()` at runtime for entity keywords that are NOT in the map, i.e. the `IfcType::from_str` `Unknown(crc32_hash(...))` fallback reached for unrecognized/vendor-extension entity keywords, which could get a silently wrong stable id for names whose hash computation happened to touch one of the two corrupted cells.

  `packages/codegen/generated/ifc4/type-ids.ts`, `packages/parser/src/generated/type-ids.ts`, `rust/core/src/generated/schema.rs`, and `packages/codegen/generated/ifc4x3/type-ids.ts` were all regenerated to correct the same two cells; each diff is exactly those two constants. The `ifc4x3` copy (see the companion changeset) is not imported by `packages/parser` or `rust/core`, so it had no runtime reader today, but it is a checked-in generated artifact and now matches the canonical table like the other three.

  `formatCRC32TableLiteral()` now validates `perLine` and throws for a zero, negative, or non-integer value instead of silently producing a broken or extremely slow result. No caller passes a non-default `perLine` today, so this is a hardening of the exported helper's contract rather than a behavioral fix to generated output — with the default (`perLine = 6`), this hardening by itself leaves the four regenerated artifacts above unchanged.

- [#2359](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2359) [`7ee619f`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/7ee619f8c6a7490982136d5677674f4f6355a568) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix a fourth checked-in copy of the corrupted CRC32 lookup table (index 111 and 245, see the earlier CRC32 table-corruption changeset) that the prior regeneration missed: `packages/codegen/generated/ifc4x3/type-ids.ts`. Its generator (`packages/codegen/src/type-ids-generator.ts`, run via `pnpm generate:ifc4x3`) already rendered the table from `formatCRC32TableLiteral()`/`buildCRC32Table()`, the single source of truth — the file itself simply hadn't been re-run after that fix landed, so it still shipped the two hand-typed-wrong cells.

  This artifact is not imported by `packages/parser` or `rust/core` (unlike the sibling `generated/ifc4/type-ids.ts`, which is copied into `packages/parser/src/generated/`), so its `TYPE_IDS` map and its `crc32Hash()` runtime fallback were not reachable from any current runtime code path. Regenerating it corrects the checked-in artifact so it matches the canonical table and stays correct if it is ever consumed.

  Regenerated diff is exactly the two constants (index 111 and 245), no unrelated churn. Added a test (`packages/codegen/test/type-ids-generator.test.ts`) that reads both checked-in `generated/ifc4/type-ids.ts` and `generated/ifc4x3/type-ids.ts` from disk and asserts their `CRC32_TABLE` matches `buildCRC32Table()` in all 256 cells, so a regenerated-but-not-committed (or committed-but-stale) artifact can't silently drift from the generator again.

  `IfcType::ALL` (re-exported as `ifc_lite_core::IFC_TYPES`) is every entity the
  EXPRESS schema declares: the enum is exhaustive but not enumerable, so anything
  reasoning about the whole schema previously had to re-parse the EXPRESS file or
  scrape the generated source.

  `attribute_names()` / `attribute_index(name)` come from the same inheritance-aware
  walk the TypeScript generator uses, so a positional index can be looked up by name
  instead of hardcoded with a comment beside it.

  Also emits two attributes the committed Rust file carried but the generator never
  produced, so regenerating no longer silently drops them.

- [#1676](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1676) [`da04601`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/da0460183dcb4e2b26ceb53cfebd8cca33c78c39) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Docs refresh: correct stale README claims and API samples against the current codebase; add READMEs to the ten published packages that shipped without one (cli, create, sdk, sandbox, lens, lists, embed-sdk, embed-protocol, encoding, viewer-core).

- [#1678](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1678) [`a90182b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a90182bac110fdd4c15b8b51866e31deefc0378e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Package metadata hygiene: correct the @ifc-lite/codegen license field to MPL-2.0 (the source has always carried MPL headers; the MIT value was a scaffolding accident) and give it a files allowlist so the npm tarball ships dist, schemas, and README instead of the whole package directory. Add the missing publishConfig, homepage, and bugs fields to codegen, embed-protocol, embed-sdk, and wasm, and homepage/bugs to create-ifc-lite, matching the rest of the workspace.

## 1.15.4

### Patch Changes

- [#1151](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1151) [`bfd9004`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bfd9004daa17f481a7b33b5c3c11f620e6cd894d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - De-duplicate the STEP serializer into a single source of truth. The
  schema-agnostic STEP serialization logic (`serializeValue`, `generateHeader`,
  `parseStepValue`, `ref`/`enumVal`/`isEntityRef`/`isEnumValue`, and the
  registry-injected `toStepLineWithRegistry` / `generateStepFileWithRegistry`)
  previously existed as four hand-synced copies — the codegen template plus three
  generated `serializers.ts` files — which had already silently drifted (the
  runtime copy carried a `?? []` hardening the template lacked). It now lives once
  in `@ifc-lite/data`; the per-schema bundles (parser runtime + codegen outputs)
  are thin re-exports that only bind their own `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` to the
  registry-coupled helpers, so the copies can never diverge again. A codegen test
  asserts the generated bundle stays a thin re-export rather than re-inlining
  logic.

  Also fixes the broken `generate:ifc4` script (it pointed at a non-existent
  `schemas/IFC4.exp`; the real file is `schemas/IFC4_ADD2_TC1.exp`). No public
  behaviour change: `@ifc-lite/parser` re-exports the same serializer symbols as
  before; `@ifc-lite/data` gains the shared primitives; `@ifc-lite/codegen` now
  declares `@ifc-lite/data` as a dependency since the generated bundle imports it.

- [#1143](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1143) [`248f2c0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/248f2c09a4d61fa27dfeaba5511a2a641d4cd278) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Preserve source IFC HEADER fields on round-trip export. Re-exporting an
  imported file previously regenerated a fresh ifc-lite header, silently dropping
  the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items (any `ViewDefinition [...]` label and vendor
  identifier / coordinate-reference strings) and flattening the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token (e.g. `IFC4X3_ADD2` → `IFC4X3`, which some toolchains
  reject).

  The parser now captures the verbatim HEADER onto a new
  `IfcDataStore.sourceHeader` (`IfcSourceHeader`, exported from `@ifc-lite/data`;
  parser also exports `parseSourceHeader`), threaded through the worker transport.
  `StepExporter` reproduces the source `FILE_DESCRIPTION` items and the exact
  `FILE_SCHEMA` token when not converting schemas, falling back to parsing the
  source bytes for cache-restored stores. Provenance stays honest:
  `preprocessor_version` is set to `ifc-lite` while the source authoring tool is
  kept as `originating_system`, and when mutations exist exactly one
  `Re-exported by ifc-lite, N modification(s)` item is appended without removing
  the source items. `generateHeader` now accepts description/author/organization
  arrays plus a free-form schema token and STEP-escapes all fields; it also emits
  a properly parenthesised `FILE_DESCRIPTION` list (the prior single-string form
  was malformed STEP). Created-from-scratch (`IfcCreator`) and federated/merged
  exports are unaffected — they keep their own provenance headers by design.

## 1.15.3

### Patch Changes

- [#946](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/946) [`6378998`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/6378998ec146f7f9297ef5fcc5953b155fd6b5e0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix a batch of verified findings from a full-codebase review (security, correctness,
  data-loss, and resource/memory leaks). Highlights:

  **Security**

  - collab-server: a malformed WebSocket frame no longer crashes the whole process
    (decode is wrapped; a bad frame is rejected/audited instead of throwing).
  - mcp: the local HTTP transport now validates `Host`/`Origin` and no longer sends a
    wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, closing a DNS-rebinding/CSRF hole; the
    `AuthScope.modelIds` allowlist is now enforced at model resolution.
  - server-bin: `extractZip` uses `execFileSync` (argv, no shell), removing command
    injection via archive/destination paths.
  - export / sdk / cli / mcp / lists / viewer CSV exporters now neutralize spreadsheet
    formula injection (CWE-1236) consistently.
  - create-ifc-lite: validates the project name (no path traversal) and drops the
    unused `execSync`-based downloader.
  - embed-sdk: inbound `postMessage` now validates `event.origin`.

  **Correctness / data-loss**

  - parser: `lengthUnitScale` survives the worker transport; the nested STEP list
    parser is string-aware (commas/parens inside quoted values no longer mis-split).
  - mutations: deleting a property from a session-created pset and replaying
    `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE` / `CREATE_PROPERTY_SET` mutations now work.
  - export: merged-export ID remapping no longer rewrites `#N` inside quoted strings.
  - drawing-2d: GPU section cutter triangle upload/readback use correct WGSL std-layout
    offsets and strides.
  - ifcx: cyclic children no longer abort the parse; spatial children round-trip; the
    mesh transform guards a zero/non-finite homogeneous `w`.
  - data / cache: a `NULL` string property value stays `null` instead of becoming `""`.
  - pointcloud, bcf, server-client, query, viewer-core, viewer store/federation: assorted
    decoding, federation-id, and selection-state fixes.

  **Resource / memory leaks**

  - geometry, query (DuckDB), renderer (GPU buffers), collab (federation presence),
    sandbox (host log capture + runtime), mcp (clash mesh cache), server-bin (signal
    listeners), and the viewer renderer on unmount now release resources deterministically.

  **Hardening (apps, not published)**

  - server: a dedicated `server-release` Cargo profile (`panic = "unwind"`) plus a
    `CatchPanicLayer` contain a malformed-IFC parse panic to the offending request
    instead of aborting the whole server.
  - desktop (Tauri): a Content-Security-Policy is set, and unused `shell:*` /
    `fs:allow-write|mkdir|remove` capabilities (and the unused shell plugin) are removed.

  **Second pass** (additional verified findings)

  - collab-server: S3 log load now follows `ListObjectsV2` pagination (no dropped frames);
    awareness frames are size-capped + rate-limited; path-lock verify runs after role/rate-limit;
    the blob route requires auth and `/metrics` can be token-gated.
  - server-bin: downloaded binaries are SHA-256 verified against a release sidecar (fail-closed on
    mismatch, warn-if-absent for older releases).
  - extensions: inner-ring capability check fails _closed_ for unknown namespaces; signing
    canonicalization is now injective (length-prefixed).
  - correctness/leaks: mutations quantity type+unit preserved on replay; `findByProperty` boolean
    comparisons; Parquet REAL columns kept as Float64; blob GC fail-safe on missing `uploadedAt`;
    spatial-hierarchy + codegen cycle guards; BVH NaN edge; bSDD/playground caches bounded;
    point-cloud GPU asset freed on federation error; mcp `parseColor` rejects non-hex; bcf/SVG/STEP
    output escaping; and more.
