/** Resolve a `geometry` column/condition to one axis of the element's World
 *  Coordinate. `axis` is matched case-insensitively; absent or blank means X.
 *
 *  AN AXIS THAT IS NOT X/Y/Z RESOLVES TO NULL, NOT TO X (#3734). It used to
 *  share the `default` arm with `case 'X'`, so a column whose axis was `Q` --
 *  a hand-edited saved list, a definition from a schema that grew an axis this
 *  build does not know -- reported the X coordinate under a header saying
 *  something else. An empty cell is a visible gap; a plausible number under
 *  the wrong label is a wrong answer that reads as a right one, and nothing
 *  downstream can tell them apart. Blank still means X, which is the
 *  documented default for a column created without an axis.
 *
 *  A DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY WITH THE SIBLING SOURCES, named so it is not read as
 *  an oversight: `getStoreyName` and the zone resolver in `engine.ts` keep the
 *  shared `case X: default:` shape and substitute their default for an
 *  unrecognised selector, which their own doc blocks call intentional. The
 *  difference is what a wrong answer costs. A storey name under a mislabelled
 *  header is visibly a name; an X coordinate under a `Q` header is a number
 *  that looks exactly as right as the correct one. Whether the siblings should
 *  follow is a separate question and is noted on #3734. */
