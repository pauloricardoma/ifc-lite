/**
 * Property-set / property NAME matching shared by Lists and Rules.
 *
 * A name wrapped in slashes (`/Qto_.*BaseQuantities/`, optionally with trailing
 * flags such as `/qto_.+/i`) is treated as a regular expression matched against
 * the candidate name; anything else is an exact, case-sensitive string match
 * (the historical behaviour). This lets one column / query pull a value from
 * several property or quantity sets at once — e.g. `NetVolume` from
 * `Qto_WallBaseQuantities` AND `Qto_SlabBaseQuantities` — the way Bonsai's
 * `/regex/` syntax works (issue #1591). IFC set / property names never contain
 * slashes, so the `/.../` form is unambiguous.

 * against untrusted data: a viewer list column, an SDK `psetName`/`propName`
 * argument, or an LLM/agent-authored sandbox script's own call arguments
 * (`packages/sandbox/src/bridge-query.ts`'s `property` tool forwards its
 * args unmodified into `sdk.property` → `compileNameMatcher`, and the regex
 * compiles and runs on the HOST's main thread, outside the QuickJS sandbox —
 * a pattern the sandboxed script "owns" can hang the real browser tab). For
 * that reason, before compiling a `/regex/` literal's body, this runs it
 * through `@ifc-lite/regex-guard`'s `assertGuardedRegexPattern`, which
 * rejects the well-known catastrophic-backtracking shapes and overlong
 * patterns.
 *
 * Throws a plain `Error` — naming the pattern and the reason — when the body
 * is syntactically valid but rejected by the guard: unlike a malformed
 * literal, there is no safe fallback here, because the whole point of
 * rejecting it is to never call `.test()` with it. A caller that cannot let
 * an exception propagate (the sandbox bridge, in particular) MUST catch
 * this — see the callers' own comments for why a throw is safe to cross
 * that boundary.
