/**
 * How an OAuth popup hands its result back to the page that opened it.
 *
 * The obvious mechanism (open the popup, poll `popup.closed` and
 * `popup.location.href` until the redirect lands on this app's own origin)
 * does not work in a cross-origin-isolated app, and fails in the most
 * misleading way possible. The viewer serves
 * `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` (it needs `crossOriginIsolated`
 * for `SharedArrayBuffer`). Under that header, opening a CROSS-ORIGIN popup
 * severs the opener/openee relationship: the `WindowProxy` `window.open`
 * returns is a disconnected stub of a window this page is no longer allowed
 * to observe. Probed live against the running viewer with an authorization
 * host:
 *
 *   window.crossOriginIsolated              -> true
 *   w = window.open('https://<authorization-host>/')
 *   w.closed          (1.5s later)          -> true, while the window is
 *                                              visibly open on screen
 *   w.location.href                         -> throws SecurityError
 *
 * So `popup.closed` reports a lie, and the poll loop rejects with "sign-in
 * was cancelled (the popup was closed)" on its very first tick while the user
 * is still looking at the provider's consent screen. A same-origin control
 * popup in the same probe behaved normally (`closed === false`,
 * `location.href` readable), which is what pins the cause on the popup being
 * cross-origin rather than on any one provider: every OAuth authorization
 * endpoint this package talks to is on someone else's origin, so every
 * provider built on it inherits the same failure.
 *
 * What still works is that the REDIRECT lands back on this app's own origin.
 * The callback page is therefore same-origin with its opener and can hand the
 * result back over a `BroadcastChannel`, which is scoped by origin and does
 * not care about the opener link that COOP cut. The opener listens on that
 * channel instead of touching the popup at all.
 *
 * Consequences worth knowing before changing any of this:
 *
 *  - **Cancellation is not detectable.** `popup.closed` is the only signal a
 *    browser gives for "the user closed the window", and it is exactly the
 *    thing COOP made unusable here. A user who closes the popup therefore
 *    waits out the timeout instead of getting an immediate "cancelled".
 *    That is a deliberate trade, not an oversight: there is no correct
 *    substitute signal, and inventing one (a heartbeat from the popup, an
 *    unload beacon) buys a nicer error message for a real cost in moving
 *    parts.
 *  - **`popup.close()` from the opener is also inert** on a severed popup.
 *    The callback page closes itself.
 *
 * This lives in `@ifc-lite/oauth-pkce` rather than in any one provider
 * because the defect is a property of the browser's COOP handling and of
 * this package's popup-based authorization flow, not of a provider. A
 * per-provider copy would be a second thing to fix the next time the
 * mechanism moves, and only one of the copies would get fixed.
