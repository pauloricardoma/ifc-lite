  //    an access-token lifetime later, far from the response that caused it.
  //    Reject the exchange and name the field.
  //  - `scope` and `token_type` are informational; nothing in this package
  //    reads them. Refusing an otherwise-valid sign-in over a non-conforming
  //    value there would be a worse outcome than the value itself, so they
  //    are dropped, which keeps the `TokenSet` honest about its own type.
