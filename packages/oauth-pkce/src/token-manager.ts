//
// The one subtlety worth documenting: concurrent refresh de-duplication.
// A page that fires several API calls at once (e.g. loading a project tree)
// can call `getValidAccessToken()` several times while the stored token is
// already expired. Each of those, done naively, would refresh independently
// — and most OAuth token endpoints treat a refresh token as single-use,
// rotating it on every use (RFC 6749 §6: "The authorization server MAY issue
// a new refresh token"; providers that rotate reject the *old* one on its
// next use). Two callers racing to refresh the same stored token then means
// one of them wins, persists a new refresh token, and the other's request
// either fails outright or silently clobbers the winner's token with a
// response the server has already invalidated. Serializing on a single
// dedup promise turns "N racing refreshes" into "one refresh, N callers
// awaiting its result" — see `getValidAccessToken` below.

/**
 * Whether a value round-tripped through `JSON.parse` is actually a usable

 *
 * `JSON.parse(raw) as TokenSet` is a compile-time assertion about a value
 * that came from outside the program — a `localStorage` entry another script
 * wrote, a key collision with a different writer, an entry truncated by a
 * quota error mid-write, or a `TokenSet` written by a future version of this
 * package with a different shape. TypeScript checks none of that at runtime,
 * so without this guard a well-formed-JSON-but-wrong-shape entry flowed
 * straight through `getValidAccessToken()` to the caller's request layer:
 * `{"refreshToken":"…","expiresAt":<future>}` produced the literal header
 * `Authorization: Bearer undefined`, a numeric `accessToken` produced
 * `Bearer 12345`, and an empty one produced `Bearer `. Each of those is a
 * request the provider answers with a 401 the caller cannot attribute to
 * anything, at a point far away from the storage entry that caused it.
 *
 * The check mirrors what `requestToken` in `token-exchange.ts` establishes
 * about a `TokenSet` this package obtained from a provider — a non-empty
 * string `accessToken`, a finite numeric `expiresAt`, and string-or-absent
 * optional fields — so a refresh's own write cannot fail it. That alignment
 * is a property to keep, not a given: it was false until `requestToken`
 * began validating the optional fields, and while it was false a provider
 * sending `"refresh_token": 12345` made a *successful* sign-in read back
 * here as "never signed in", with each retry reproducing it. Anything
 * loosened on either side has to be loosened on both.
 *
 * The one writer this cannot speak for is `setTokens`, whose argument is
 * caller-supplied and checked only by the type system: a caller reaching it
 * from untyped JavaScript can still store an entry this guard rejects, and
 * it will read back as "no session".
 *
 * `expiresAt` matters as much as `accessToken`: it is the input to the
 * freshness comparison, and a `NaN` there makes `expiresAt - skew > now`
 * false, which reads as "expired" and quietly routes a possibly-fine token
 * into a refresh instead of being caught. `accessToken` is checked for
 * non-whitespace rather than merely non-empty, because `"   "` is just as
 * unusable as `""` — it produces the header `Authorization: Bearer    ` and
 * the same 401 the caller cannot attribute to anything.
 *
 * Fails closed: a value that doesn't pass is reported as *no* stored token,
 * so the caller re-authenticates rather than sending a broken header.

/**
 * Everything tied to one signed-in session's lifetime, as a single object
 * `clear()` replaces wholesale rather than resetting piecemeal.
 *
 * Earlier versions of this file tracked the same underlying question — "is
 * this operation still working on behalf of the session that's current
 * right now?" — with two independent fields: `pendingRefresh` (the in-flight
 * refresh-dedup promise) and a `generation` counter bumped by `clear()`.
 * Splitting the question across two fields is what caused a defect:
 * `clear()` bumped `generation` but forgot to also clear `pendingRefresh`,
 * so a stale in-flight refresh could still be handed to a brand-new caller
 * by the dedup check, which never consulted `generation` at all.
 *
 * Folding both into one `Session` object removes the field to forget: the
 * dedup promise now *lives inside* the session it was started under, so
 * "does this dedup promise belong to the current session" and "is this the
 * current session" collapse into the same reference comparison
 * (`session === this.session`). A refresh's closure captures the `Session`
 * it was launched under; once `clear()` swaps `this.session` for a new
 * instance, that closure is left holding a reference nothing else can
 * reach — new callers read `this.session.pendingRefresh`, which is `null`
 * on the fresh object, so they can never be handed the stale promise, and
 * the closure's own identity check (`session !== this.session`) fails
 * wherever it still checks. There is no second field left to go stale.
 *
 * This part of the design was independently re-verified as correct across
 * several rounds of review and is unchanged here — what follows fixes a
 * *different* problem: the session check and the storage write it gates
 * used to be two separate `await`s, which is a gap a concurrent write can
 * land in no matter how carefully the check is written. See `queue` below.

  /**
   * Every `TokenStorage` operation this manager performs against
   * `config.storage` — `get`, `set`, `delete`, and the session-check-then-
   * write a refresh does before persisting — runs through this promise
   * chain, one at a time, in the order it was enqueued. That is what
   * replaces the old check-then-rollback machinery: a refresh's "is my
   * session still current, and if so, write" is now a *single* queued task,
   * so there is no `await` boundary between the check and the write for a
   * concurrent `clear()` or `setTokens()` to land in, and therefore nothing
   * to detect after the fact and undo. Two previous rounds tried to make a
   * check-then-write pair safe by re-validating after the write and rolling
   * back on mismatch (`git log` on this file has the details); the rollback
   * was itself a second check-then-act with the same shape of gap, one
   * level down. Serializing the operations removes the gap instead of
   * chasing it to a smaller time window.
   *
   * This does mean an operation can wait behind whatever this manager's own
   * previous operation is still doing — most concretely, `clear()`
   * (sign-out) can wait behind a refresh's in-flight write. That trade-off
   * was rejected in an earlier round on the grounds that sign-out could
   * then hang on a slow backend. That concern is real, but the queue this
   * manager owns only ever holds *this manager's* own handful of
   * operations for *one* storage key — a refresh write, a `clear()`, an
   * occasional explicit `setTokens()` — so the wait is bounded by one
   * storage round trip already in flight, not by unrelated traffic
   * elsewhere in the app. A storage backend that hangs outright is a
   * problem for every caller of it, serialized or not; this queue does not
   * make that failure mode worse, it just makes sign-out share it with the
   * write that was already in progress.
