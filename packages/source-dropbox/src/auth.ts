// Endpoints per Dropbox's own OAuth guide (`developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide`,

// *different* hosts, which is easy to get wrong:
//
//  - authorization: `https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize` — a web page
//    the user is navigated to, served by the www front end.
//  - token: `https://api.dropboxapi.com/oauth2/token` — an API endpoint, on
//    the same API host as the data-plane RPCs in `http-client.ts`.
//
// `www.dropbox.com/oauth2/token` is NOT an alias of the token endpoint: it
// answers a well-formed exchange with the www front end's generic
// `text/html` "Error (400)" page instead of the RFC 6749 §5.2 JSON body, so
// a sign-in pointed there dies at the exchange with a bare
// "token endpoint returned 400" and no reason. Verified against both hosts
// with a deliberately invalid code: `api.dropboxapi.com` answers
// `{"error": "invalid_grant", ...}`, `www.dropbox.com` answers HTML.
// `test/auth.test.ts` pins the host so this cannot silently drift back.

 * One `TokenManager` per app key, for the lifetime of the page.
 *
 * `TokenManager`'s protections are all PER-INSTANCE: `clear()` swaps
 * `this.session` and queues its delete on `this.queue`, and a refresh checks
 * `session !== this.session` on its own instance before writing. A refresh in
 * flight on instance A therefore cannot see a `clear()` performed on instance
 * B — so building a fresh manager per call makes sign-out unable to disarm an
 * in-flight refresh, and the refresh writes a valid token set back AFTER
 * sign-out deleted it. The user is silently signed back in on the next mount,
 * with a live refresh token left in `localStorage`. Reproduced end to end
 * against this package before the cache existed; `test/refresh-race.test.ts`
 * is the guard.
 *
 * Why keyed on `clientId` and not on `ctx`: the host mints a fresh
 * `PluginContext` per operation (`SourceHost.createContext` in the viewer), so
 * a listing and a `signOut()` never share one and keying on `ctx` would
 * de-duplicate nothing. The resource being protected is the single stored
 * token set, which lives under one fixed {@link STORAGE_KEY} inside the host's
 * per-provider storage namespace, so the app key that selects the account is
 * the right identity.
 *
 * The consequence is that the first caller's `ctx.fetch`/`ctx.storage` are the
 * ones the cached manager keeps using. That is sound because both derive from
 * this package's constant manifest rather than from anything context-varying:
 * `fetch` is the manifest's permission check, `storage` is `localStorage`
 * namespaced by the manifest name.
