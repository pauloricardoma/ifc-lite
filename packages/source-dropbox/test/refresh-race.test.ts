/**
 * Sign-out must survive a token refresh that is already on the wire.
 *
 * `TokenManager`'s protections are all PER-INSTANCE. `clear()` swaps
 * `this.session` and queues its delete on `this.queue`; a refresh re-checks
 * `session !== this.session` on its OWN instance before persisting. So a
 * provider that builds a fresh `TokenManager` per call has those guarantees by
 * name only: `signOut()` gets instance B, the in-flight listing refresh is on
 * instance A, and B's `clear()` is invisible to A. A deletes-then-writes race
 * follows, and the write wins because it lands last.
 *
 * The consequence is the one that matters here, and it is a privacy defect
 * rather than a correctness one: the user clicks Sign out, the UI goes to
 * signed-out, and a valid `refreshToken` is left sitting in `localStorage`
 * under `dropbox:tokens`. The next mount restores it and signs them straight
 * back into an account they explicitly disconnected — on a shared machine,
 * into someone else's Dropbox.
 *
 * NOTE ON THE SIBLING PACKAGE. `source-msgraph` guards the same shape with
 * `test/refresh-race.test.ts`, but its harm is different: Microsoft rotates
 * SPA refresh tokens on use, so a duplicate POST is answered `invalid_grant`
 * and kills the session. **Dropbox does not rotate** — its refresh response
 * carries no `refresh_token` and `TokenManager` merges
 * `refreshed.refreshToken ?? refreshToken`, so duplicate POSTs both succeed.
 * Copying msgraph's "exactly ONE POST" assertion here would therefore pin a
 * property that is merely wasteful for Dropbox while missing the real defect.
 * The POST count is asserted as a secondary property; the resurrection is the
 * primary one.
