/**
 * The structural view of a parsed LandXML document that the IFC mapping reads.
 *
 * Declared here rather than imported from the viewer on purpose: a converter
 * that cannot be unit-tested without mounting the viewer is not a converter.
 * The viewer's `LandXmlTinDocument` satisfies these shapes structurally, so the
 * adaptation is a type assignment and not a translation layer that could drift.
 *
 * Everything the mapping refuses (§5, §11.5 of the mapping spec) appears here as an
 * opaque `readonly unknown[]`. That is deliberate: the converter must *count and
 * name* those records to refuse them honestly, and must not be able to read
 * into them, which is what would let a refusal quietly become a partial export.
