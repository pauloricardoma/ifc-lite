/**
 * The storey's own plan frame, expressed in the MODEL'S WORLD FRAME — the whole
 * `IfcLocalPlacement` chain the storey hangs from (storey axis ∘ building ∘
 * site ∘ …), composed, in metres — plus the two folds between that frame and
 * the storey-local one.
 *
 * Why this exists. `addSpaceToStore` authors the outer curve under a placement
 * whose `PlacementRelTo` is the storey's own placement, so every coordinate it
 * is handed is read back through that chain. A producer that already works in
 * world coordinates — anything derived from rendered geometry, which has the
 * chain baked in — must therefore divide the chain out first, or the reader
 * applies it a second time and the room lands a whole site offset and rotation
 * away from the walls it was drawn between. The headless producers
 * (`extractWallSegmentsForStorey`, `existingSpaceFootprintsByStorey`) are
 * storey-local for exactly this reason; these two functions let a world-frame
 * producer join them.
 *
 * Refusing rather than guessing is deliberate in both failure modes below. A
 * subtly turned room is not visible in the tool that drew it: it shows up when
 * somebody else opens the exported file, or when the area is quoted in a
 * schedule.
