/**
 * The storey plan frame the authored-element mirror meshes are drawn through
 * (#6233). Picks go the other way through the storey workplane
 * (`lib/commands/modeling/workplane.ts`), which takes its plan from here.
 *
 * Every builder (`addWallToStore`, `addColumnToStore`, …) anchors its element
 * to the storey's own placement, so the coordinates it is handed are STOREY-
 * LOCAL: a reader applies the storey's whole placement chain (storey axis ∘
 * building ∘ site) to them. A click, a hover and the instant 3D mirror all
 * live in the MODEL frame — the rendered geometry, which already has that
 * chain baked in. Handing a model-frame click to a builder as if it were
 * storey-local applies the chain a second time: on the demo project the
 * storey hangs 3 m east and 3 m north of the model origin, so every element
 * the Model workspace authored landed 3 m away on export and reload, while
 * the mirror drew it under the cursor.
 *
 * Same frame algebra as the Room tool's space writer, reused rather
 * than re-derived: `storeyPlanFrame` composes the chain, and the offset back to
 * the file's own world frame is the whole `world = render + originShift + rtc`
 * reconstruction — `roomFramePlanOffsets` (the TS origin shift, which Space
 * Sketch's room frame already carries) plus `roomFrameToModelWorld` (the survey
 * anchor the wasm path subtracted). Both are zero for a model near the origin.
 *
 * Unlike the Room tool this falls back to the identity instead of refusing when
 * the chain will not resolve: that is exactly what the tool did before for
 * every storey, and a storey authored in this session (no source record) has
 * no chain to read. Refusing would block authoring outright on such a storey.
