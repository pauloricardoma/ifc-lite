/**
 * Wall joins (#6232 D1): where two straight walls meet, decide which one runs
 * through and how far each body extends past, or stops short of, its axis end,
 * so the two bodies meet with no overlap and no gap. Pure plan geometry: no
 * editor, no store.
 *
 * Three kinds, told apart by where the two axes' lines cross:
 *
 *  - `L`    both walls end at the crossing (a corner). One wall runs through
 *           to the outer corner, the other stops at its inner face.
 *  - `T`    one wall ends on the other's path. The path wall runs through
 *           unchanged, the ending wall stops at its near face.
 *  - `butt` the walls are collinear and meet end to end. Both stop square at
 *           the shared point, whatever their thicknesses or offsets.
 *
 * The joined end of each axis is snapped to the crossing, so a wall drawn to
 * the other's face (or a little short of it) gets an axis that meets the
 * other's axis, which is what `IfcRelConnectsPathElements` describes.
 *
 * A body end is a cut across the wall's thickness: how far the body reaches
 * past the axis end along its left face and along its right face. A right-angle
 * join or a butt join cuts square (both the same), so the body stays an
 * `IfcRectangleProfileDef`. At any other angle the cut runs along the other
 * wall's face, which a rectangle cannot follow: the body becomes a four-point
 * `IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef`. It is still a butt join (one wall runs through,
 * the other stops at its face), not a mitre, and no boolean clipping is used.
