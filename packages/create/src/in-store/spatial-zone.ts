/**
 * Anchored builder for `IfcSpatialZone` - the schema's own name for a region
 * that is not bounded by physical elements (issue #2508 item 3).
 *
 * A location zone is a construction section or takt area a user drew against
 * the rendered scene. `docs/design/zone-emission.md` argues why it must NOT be
 * emitted as an `IfcZone`: that type groups SPACES, its `IsGroupedBy` admits
 * only `IfcSpace` / `IfcSpatialZone` / nested `IfcZone`, and this repo's own
 * reader (`extractGroupMembersOnDemand`) describes an `IfcZone`'s members that
 * way. Assigning walls to one produces a file we would mis-read ourselves.
 *
 * `IfcSpatialZone` is the type that means this, and two of its properties are
 * why it fits where `IfcZone` does not:
 *
 * - Elements attach through **`IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure`**, which is
 *   many-to-many and ADDITIVE. It leaves `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` -
 *   the exclusive relation that carries the building's real hierarchy -
 *   untouched, so emitting zones never re-parents anything.
 * - A straddling element can therefore be referenced in BOTH zones it crosses,
 *   which is the truthful statement of the topology.
 *
 * What this cannot say is HOW MUCH of an element is in a zone. That is the
 * quantity write-back's job (`IfcLite_ZoneVolumes`), and the two are
 * complementary rather than alternatives: emit alongside the property sets,
 * never instead of them.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no parser access - operates entirely through the editor, like
 * every other builder here.
