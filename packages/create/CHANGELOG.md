# @ifc-lite/create

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5932](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5932) [`f34299c`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/f34299ca63a368dbaa68ad911f628eabb49dbcde) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - LandXML → IFC (mapping v1.3, spec §14): station equations are now written instead of refused. Each `StaEquation` on a written alignment becomes an `IfcReferent` / `.STATION.` with `Pset_Stationing` (`Station`, `IncomingStation`, `HasIncreasingStation`), linearly placed at its distance along the alignment's curve and nested with the start referent in order along the alignment. An alignment's equations are refused all or none, by name, when one cannot be placed. A vertical profile on an alignment with station equations is no longer refused: its PVI stations are read as displayed stations and placed through the stationing, and only a station in an equation's gap or displayed at more than one place is refused. `AlignmentParams` gains an optional `StationEquations` list and `AlignmentResult` an `equationReferentIds` list; `StationEquationParams` is exported. `CgPoint`s stay `IfcAnnotation` / `.SURVEY.` (§14.3 records why).

- [#5930](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5930) [`96b0404`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/96b04045f0f3708a453ed18f23c54a1a0745ed42) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - LandXML → IFC mapping v1.2: a written alignment's design profile (`ProfAlign`) is now exported as `IfcAlignmentVertical` with `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment`s (`CONSTANTGRADIENT`, `PARABOLICARC`, `CIRCULARARC`; an `UnsymParaCurve` as two parabolic arcs) and an `IfcGradientCurve` over the horizontal composite curve, following IfcOpenShell's vertical segment mapping. Profiles that cannot be mapped exactly (sampled `ProfSurf`, unlinked, a second design profile, station equations, inconsistent curves, a profile running past its alignment) are refused by name with their reason. `AlignmentParams` gains an optional `Vertical` layout, `AlignmentResult` optional `verticalId` / `gradientCurveId`, and `LandXmlIfcCoverage` an optional `profiles` count.

### Major Changes

- [#5722](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5722) [`cddb321`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/cddb32122c9d628b635910158a06fa5a94c0071a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Remove `ProjectParams.FileSchemaIdentifier` ([#5562](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5562)). It has done nothing since [#5351](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5351): `IfcCreator` declares every IFC4X3 file as `FILE_SCHEMA(('IFC4X3_ADD2'))` on its own. The only thing it still did was throw when combined with a `Schema` other than `'IFC4X3'`. Callers just delete the option; the output does not change.

### Minor Changes

- [#5731](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5731) [`91b1340`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/91b1340bbba42abc42d9842169e422b540aa96eb) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Numeric property values are now written as the measure type they declare. `addIfcPropertySet` used to emit every number as `IFCREAL` or `IFCINTEGER` whatever `Type` said, so a `ThermalTransmittance` declared `IfcThermalTransmittanceMeasure` came out `IFCREAL(0.25)` and failed IDS data-type checks against `Pset_WallCommon`. `PropertyType` now accepts any `Ifc…Measure` (new `PropertyMeasureType`); a whole `IfcCountMeasure` is written as an integer, and a type name that is not a bare IFC identifier is refused instead of being spliced into the STEP line.

### Patch Changes

- [#5671](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5671) [`e095908`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e0959083fa58854ce536c0a68d7b0c52f824f5ef) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `IfcCreator` and the in-store builders no longer write an `IfcAxis2Placement3D` with a `RefDirection` but no `Axis` (or the reverse), which failed the `AxisAndRefDirProvision` rule in IfcOpenShell validation. Walls, stairs, curtain walls, furnishing elements, rotated spatial zones and any `addLocalPlacement` given only one of the two now write both, with the missing one set to its schema default, so the placement's geometry is unchanged ([#5469](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5469)). The one case the schema leaves undefined, an `Axis` of exactly `-X` with no `RefDirection` (world X projects to zero), now writes world Y as the RefDirection.

- [#5920](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5920) [`d83d9fe`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d83d9fe4138e0d6ae64a3ed439c8a5c9a280878a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - A placement given only an `Axis` of exactly `-X` now writes `RefDirection (0,-1,0)`, the value ifc-lite's own reader uses for an absent RefDirection there, instead of world Y, which rendered it turned 180 degrees compared with before ([#5469](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5469)).

- [#5908](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5908) [`dcdc8df`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/dcdc8dff3ea9e0588ffcce802b0f3ec781082f2e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `addIfcPropertySet` now rejects a malformed `Type` on a string property too, as it already did for numbers, so the type name can't be spliced into the STEP line. An empty `Type` (a JSON payload that defaults an unset field to `''`) is treated as undeclared and no longer throws.

- [#5904](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5904) [`ddebcd9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ddebcd91b999d6304e19358f90d142cd439a420a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces: a wall created in this session now bounds rooms only on the storey it is contained in ([#5642](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5642)). `extractWallSegmentsForStorey` used to add every overlay-created divider to whichever storey was being processed, so a wall authored on one storey split rooms on every storey. Created dividers now come from the same spatial walk as source ones: a created divider with no `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` (for example a raw `IfcWall` added through a generic entity-create tool) no longer bounds any storey, and the extraction's `considered` count no longer counts created walls twice.

### Patch Changes

- [#5579](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5579) [`e48f59b`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e48f59b0cadf092335a84ce85b4d970e653b7d2c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - In-store authoring walks, review follow-up ([#5249](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5249)): storeys are enumerated from the edited model (`listStoreys` takes an optional overlay; a deleted storey is no longer listed), a created wall retyped out of the divider set no longer bounds rooms, queued positional edits to containment/aggregation relationships are honoured, and the overlay is snapshotted once per walk. The headless `bim.spaces` backend passes the session's mutation view.

## 2.9.1

### Patch Changes

- [#5571](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5571) [`0f5d174`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0f5d174d2fb726536d1a3a30c7e5415603db72c0) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - IFC4X3 output now declares `FILE_SCHEMA(('IFC4X3_ADD2'))`, the ISO 16739-1:2024 identifier, instead of the bare `IFC4X3` ([#5351](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5351)). ifc-lite already wrote IFC4X3_ADD2's attribute layouts. IfcOpenShell, and the buildingSMART Validation Service built on it, resolves the bare `IFC4X3` token to a later development schema whose layouts differ (`IfcTriangulatedFaceSet`/`IfcTriangulatedIrregularNetwork` put `Closed` before `Normals`, and `IfcMapConversion` has 10 attributes instead of 8), so it rejected conformant files because of the identifier alone.
  
  This applies wherever ifc-lite chooses the identifier: `IfcCreator` with `Schema: 'IFC4X3'`, a `StepExporter` conversion to `IFC4X3`, a `MergedExporter` export to `IFC4X3`, and the Rust STEP and merged exporters (CLI, wasm) when given an explicit IFC4X3 target. A re-export that does not change schema still keeps the source file's own `FILE_SCHEMA` token verbatim. The Rust STEP exporter now follows the TypeScript rule for that too: an explicit target that does not change the schema family keeps the source token rather than writing the target label. The `schema` options still take `'IFC4X3'`, and ifc-lite reads both identifiers as IFC4X3.
  
  `ProjectParams.FileSchemaIdentifier` (added in `@ifc-lite/create` 2.9.0 as the opt-in for this) is deprecated: IFC4X3 output is declared `IFC4X3_ADD2` without it, so it no longer changes the output. It still refuses a `Schema` other than `'IFC4X3'`, and is removed at the next major ([#5562](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5562)).
  
  `@ifc-lite/data` exports `fileSchemaIdentifier(schema)`, which maps a schema family to the identifier a writer declares. It is the single source for the TypeScript writers.

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5316](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5316) [`a250a92`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a250a928b1c8c64ac6153136772fe6c71398eee9) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Allow `resolveSpatialAnchor` to read the effective entity set through an optional mutation view. In-store authoring can now target a created storey or placement and will not reuse deleted or retyped-away owner history, contexts, storeys or placements ([#5249](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5249)). CLI and viewer authoring pass their live views.
  
  `StoreEditor.getMutationView()` gives in-store helpers the same effective read context; generated spaces now resolve their anchor through it.

- [#5370](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5370) [`d05f542`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d05f5423a7caf761f0a2e12d064d85e84355d031) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - LandXML→IFC now writes horizontal alignments as `IfcAlignment` (mapping spec v1.1, §11). Line, circular arc and clothoid segments become `IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment`s, together with their `IfcCompositeCurve` geometry, a zero-length terminating segment and a start-station `IfcReferent`, aggregated by the project. An alignment containing anything else (an IrregularLine, a non-clothoid spiral, an unresolved point reference, a gap, or a segment whose parameters miss its authored end point) is refused whole and by name, because a gap would make every later station wrong. `IfcCreator.terrain().addAlignment` exposes the emitter, and `mapAlignments` / `alignmentMappingOf` expose the mapping as a cheap pre-flight.
  
  Converted files now declare `FILE_SCHEMA(('IFC4X3_ADD2'))` through the new `ProjectParams.FileSchemaIdentifier`. The layouts written were always IFC4X3_ADD2's, but IfcOpenShell (and the buildingSMART validator built on it) resolves the bare `IFC4X3` token to a later development schema and rejects them ([#5351](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5351)). The output is now checked in CI by `ifcopenshell.validate`, and alignment geometry by IfcOpenShell's own mapping and evaluator.
  
  Nothing published narrows or gains a required member, whichever of this and the pending release ships first. `LandXmlIfcCoverage.alignments` is optional. `LandXmlIfcSource.alignments` stays `unknown[]`: each record is shape-checked at run time (`isAlignmentRecord`), and one that is not a `LandXmlIfcAlignment` is refused by name rather than read into.

- [#5268](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5268) [`9132f7a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9132f7ab81939eb145e8fe1b26eb1e9048321638) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `landXmlToIfc` converts a parsed LandXML document to IFC4X3, implementing v1.0 of `docs/architecture/landxml-to-ifc-mapping.md` ([#4937](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4937)). A TIN surface becomes `IfcGeographicElement`/`.TERRAIN.` carrying an `IfcTriangulatedIrregularNetwork`; a `CgPoint` becomes `IfcAnnotation`/`.SURVEY.` with a property set; a declared CRS becomes `IfcProjectedCRS` + `IfcMapConversion`.
  
  Purely additive. Every out-of-scope LandXML record family (alignments, profiles, cross sections, roadways, parcels, monuments, plan features, pipe networks, surface breaklines/boundaries/contours) is counted and named rather than dropped, and a source with no mappable record returns `{ status: 'refused' }` rather than a valid, empty IFC. GlobalIds derive deterministically from the LandXML source id; with a fixed `timestampMs`, re-exporting an unchanged source is byte-identical (without one, only the header and owner-history timestamps differ).
  
  `IfcCreator.terrain()` exposes the underlying IFC4X3 terrain/survey emitters directly. It throws on any other schema — `IfcTriangulatedIrregularNetwork` and the `.TERRAIN.`/`.SURVEY.` predefined types do not exist before IFC4X3.

- [#5279](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5279) [`24b7921`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/24b79210c442f44614d5786ff2986ee3a2b9c0d7) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `addColumnToStore`, `addDoorToStore`, `addWindowToStore`, `addSlabToStore`, `addRoofToStore`, `addPlateToStore` and `addSpaceToStore` now reject a non-finite `Position` (`NaN`/`Infinity`), naming the field. This matches the guard `addWallToStore`/`addBeamToStore`/`addMemberToStore` already apply to `Start`/`End`. `IfcCreator` now refuses a non-finite coordinate at the single point where every `IfcCartesianPoint` is written. That covers `addIfcColumn`, `addIfcDoor`, `addIfcWindow`, `addIfcSlab`, `addIfcRoof`, `addIfcPlate` and `addIfcSpace`, plus every other builder that places a caller-supplied point (stair, ramp, gable roof, footing, pile, furnishing, proxy, hosted door and window fills, openings). Before this change, a non-finite `Position` produced an invalid file with no error: `$` inside `IfcCartesianPoint.Coordinates` on the in-store path, and a `NaN.` token on the `IfcCreator` path. Callers that pass a computed, possibly non-finite `Position` now get a thrown `Error` instead of a corrupt export.

### Patch Changes

- [#5459](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5459) [`809e2ba`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/809e2baa4b796a91ea2a2dbd52ae29e7dd4ef5ff) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Expose the effective root geometric context on spatial anchors so drawing markup can parent its subcontext under live edits.

- [#5520](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5520) [`d8f7c64`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/d8f7c643703012c55a41a1e8224db6e21a0c66b3) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - In-store authoring walks read the session's edited model ([#5249](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5249)). Auto Spaces no longer treats a wall deleted this session, or retyped into a non-divider class, as a room divider. Space Sketch dedup (`existingSpaceFootprintsByStorey`, now taking an optional overlay) counts a space created earlier in the session as existing, and no longer counts a deleted one. Duplicate (`resolveDuplicateSource`, now taking an optional `StoreEditor`) replays only the source's live association relationships, including ones created this session, and refuses a source deleted this session. `OverlayWallReader` gains optional `isDeleted` and `getTypeMutations`.

- [#5318](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5318) [`b8a9cde`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b8a9cde0a7dfe40137632bf083875961efb57c1a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Make in-store style authoring enumerate effective IfcStyledItem records. Deleted source styles no longer block restyling, while overlay-created styles prevent duplicate styling ([#5249](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5249)).

- [#5269](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5269) [`9f48e65`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9f48e653f8264d303f70f47370be727ebca6049a) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `IfcCreator` no longer writes an invalid STEP REAL for values with magnitude >= 1e21. At that size `Number.prototype.toFixed` switches to JavaScript exponent notation (`1e+21`), which has no decimal point in the mantissa, so the fixed-decimal fallback leaked it into the file. Those values are now written in the ISO 10303-21 exponent form (`1.E+21`) using the same `formatStepReal` rule that `@ifc-lite/export` uses. `NaN` and `Infinity` have no STEP REAL spelling, so they now throw instead of being written as `NaN.` / `Infinity.`. Values below 1e21 serialize byte-for-byte as before.

### Minor Changes

- [#5170](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5170) [`0eafae1`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0eafae1cb19e70828815c658a6ee3c14f9c4c8a8) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - In-store element builders (`addWallToStore`, `addColumnToStore`, … and the matching `bim.store.add*` params) accept an explicit `GlobalId`. A re-runnable author such as a flow graph derives it from a stable key so a re-run updates the element instead of duplicating it; relationships keep their own generated GUIDs, and a malformed GlobalId is refused. The naming quartet every in-store element shares is now one exported `AddElementCommonParams` the params extend.

- [#5231](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5231) [`b0d489e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b0d489ea7270b84c1d373b5e340fc09ba0c798e6) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Structural analysis authoring ([#5167](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/5167)).
  
  `@ifc-lite/create` gains in-store builders for `IfcStructuralAnalysisModel`, `IfcStructuralCurveMember`, `IfcStructuralPointConnection`, `IfcStructuralLoadGroup`/`IfcStructuralLoadCase`, `IfcStructuralPointAction` and `IfcStructuralLinearAction`, plus `IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember`, `IfcRelConnectsStructuralActivity` and `IfcRelAssignsToGroup`. Each entity owns its representation outright — nothing is shared between entities — and every build result exposes the express ids it owns.
  
  **Breaking for SDK backend implementers:** `StoreBackendMethods` now extends `StructuralStoreBackendMethods`, adding nine required members. Any external implementation of that interface stops compiling until it supplies them (the in-repo CLI, viewer and MCP backends are updated here). Nothing else in the SDK surface changed shape.
  
  `bim.store.addStructural*` reaches them through a shared `createStructuralStoreBackend` factory, wired into the CLI backend and the viewer store adapter from the same per-call resolution the cost surface uses, so an entity authored through either is visible to the next call on the other. MCP v0.1 authors through `entity_create` and refuses these explicitly.

### Minor Changes

- [#5016](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/5016) [`0100a54`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/0100a544d0446d2f19b5f76f37d6dc45d31da837) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the loaded-model cost-authoring foundation: mutation-aware cost reads, effective created-record export, schema-consistent cost builders, relationship assignment, reference-safe removal, and StoreEditor entity-type/schema lookup.

### Patch Changes

- [#4957](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4957) [`ab8380e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ab8380e6b9edf1ca1f05abf343ae6040ac8aee77) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - `EntityTable.getTypeName()` returns the literal string `'Unknown'`, not `null`/`undefined`, for rows it can't resolve, so `getTypeName(id) || fallback` silently kept `'Unknown'` instead of falling back — breaking element duplication on imported models ([#4933](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4933)) among other call sites. Added `resolvedTypeName()` to `@ifc-lite/data` (returns `undefined` for the sentinel) and switched every affected lookup in `create`/`parser`/`cli`/`mcp` to use it.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#4876](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4876) [`8733dc9`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8733dc9cb391344606b9bc59beb00a6f9d1de135) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Author IFC 5D cost data from scratch. `IfcCreator` gains exact-name methods for
  `IfcCostSchedule`, `IfcCostItem`, `IfcCostValue`, the `IfcMonetaryUnit` /
  `IfcSIUnit` / `IfcMeasureWithUnit` a rate is quoted in, standalone
  `IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity` values, and the nesting / schedule / product / task
  relationships that bind them, all backed by one shared builder
  (`ifc-creator-cost.ts`) and exposed through `bim.create.*`. A new
  `ProjectParams.Currency` writes the project `IfcMonetaryUnit`.
  
  Written to be read back by the cost read model added in [#4863](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4863): values that carry
  a literal amount are serialized as named SELECT branches
  (`IFCMONETARYMEASURE(1234.56)`), never as bare numbers, while
  `IfcQuantityArea.AreaValue` and its siblings stay bare because they are defined
  types rather than SELECTs. `UnitBasis` is preserved as the real per-quantity
  divisor it is, a shared measure entity is written once and referenced, and a
  value derived from `Components` is not normalised into a literal (or the
  reverse).
  
  Absent stays absent. There is no default currency — a model authored without one
  reads back with none rather than a guess — and an omitted list attribute is
  written as absent while an EMPTY array is refused, because the two are different
  answers. Cost authoring is refused explicitly under IFC2X3, where the entities
  have a different attribute layout, rather than silently writing nothing.
  
  A fractional `IfcQuantityCount` value is refused rather than silently rounded:
  `IfcQuantityCount.CountValue` is stored as an unparsed string on read, so a
  rounded count would round-trip altered with no trace of the change.

### Minor Changes

- [#4835](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4835) [`863a60e`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/863a60ea70034cb8b5c2ebd27e7153a312556c6c) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Add IfcWorkCalendar / IfcWorkTime / IfcRecurrencePattern support to the 4D scheduling pipeline: calendars and their working / exception times are now extracted, round-tripped losslessly on export, and readable from `bim.schedule.data()`. `IfcCreator.addIfcWorkCalendar` (plus the `assignCalendarToTasks` alias) authors them, exposed through `bim.create.*`. Calendars are surfaced read-only — deriving working-day-aware task dates from a recurrence pattern is not implemented.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#4503](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/4503) [`5e94b1a`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/5e94b1a646d7e02c909b8835f3adf8e0bf4feb5f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Add `storeyPlanFrame`, `toStoreyLocal` and `fromStoreyLocal`: the storey's whole
  `IfcLocalPlacement` chain (storey axis ∘ building ∘ site ∘ …) composed into one
  planar rigid motion in the model's world frame, in metres, and the two folds
  between that frame and the storey-local one.
  
  `addSpaceToStore` anchors the outer curve to the storey's own placement, so
  every coordinate it is handed is read back through that chain. The in-package
  producers are storey-local for exactly that reason; a producer that already
  works in world coordinates now has a supported way to divide the chain out
  before authoring, and to fold `existingSpaceFootprintsByStorey`'s storey-local
  rings the other way for a comparison in its own frame.
  
  `storeyPlanFrame` returns `null` rather than approximating when the storey
  itself will not read, when a link in the chain will not read, or when any link's
  `Axis` tips out of plan — a tilted chain has no planar inverse. A storey with no
  `ObjectPlacement` at all gets the identity: `ObjectPlacement` is OPTIONAL on
  `IfcProduct`, and a product without one carries no transform.
  
  The placement-frame primitives these share with `extractWallSegmentsForStorey`
  move to an internal `placement-frame` module so both sides compose and invert
  the chain through one implementation. No existing export changes.

Added for issue [#4153](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4153)'s read side (`apps/viewer`'s drawing-markup reader, not part of this package); no existing export changed.

Not wired into the viewer UI yet; see issue [#4153](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/4153) for the "save into model" direction this is the write half of.

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#3572](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3572) [`36719c2`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/36719c22f2cbd6027d8afc73c660cda5c994fdf4) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `IfcCreator.addIfcPropertySet` no longer downgrades a boolean property declared `Type: 'IfcLogical'` to `IFCBOOLEAN`. `serializePropertyValue`'s boolean branch ignored `PropertyDef.Type` entirely and always emitted `IFCBOOLEAN(.T./.F.)`, so a caller asking for the tri-state `IfcLogical` measure (used throughout the standard IFC property sets, e.g. `Pset_LandRegistration.IsLandmarked`) got the two-state `IfcBoolean` type in the file instead — the value round-tripped correctly, but the declared property type did not match what was requested. `Type: 'IfcLogical'` now emits `IFCLOGICAL(.T./.F.)`; omitting `Type`, or passing `Type: 'IfcBoolean'`, is unchanged.

- [#3692](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3692) [`b9c8fdf`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/b9c8fdfbc5e224003fa2094f7b9703aa71600dbf) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Several `IfcCreator` element/relationship writers wrote an attribute count that only matched the IFC4/IFC4X3 schema, not IFC2X3, for entities whose trailing attribute list genuinely differs between schema versions:
  
  - `addIfcElementQuantity` omitted `IfcQuantityLength`/`Area`/`Volume`/`Weight`/`Count`'s trailing `Formula` attribute entirely (added in IFC4) instead of writing it as an unset `$` — every quantity record was one attribute short of the IFC4/IFC4X3 declaration.
  - `addIfcWall`/`addIfcColumn`/`addIfcBeam` and `addIfcRelSequence` always wrote a trailing `PredefinedType`/`UserDefinedSequenceType` value, an attribute IFC2X3 does not declare at all — so a creator targeting `Schema: 'IFC2X3'` emitted one attribute too *many* for those entities, which is exactly as invalid as writing too few.
  
  STEP part 21 requires an explicit slot for every attribute a schema version declares — no more, no fewer. The trailing attribute is now written only for schemas that declare it (IFC4/IFC4X3), driven off the creator's own `Schema` field, and omitted for IFC2X3.

- [#3656](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3656) [`e09b5c3`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/e09b5c364138d56816e45452622078e951e051ee) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - `generateSpacesFromWalls` (`ifc-lite generate-spaces` / `bim.spaces.generate`) no longer reports `NetFloorArea` larger than `GrossFloorArea` when `--boundary outer` (or `center`) is used. `addSpaceToStore` derives `NetFloorArea` from the emitted `OuterCurve` polygon's own area when a caller omits `netFloorArea`; the orchestrator passed only `grossFloorArea` (the centreline measure), assuming `OuterCurve` was always the inner (net) face — true only for the default `--boundary inner`. Under `outer`, `OuterCurve` is the outward-offset (larger) footprint, so the reported `NetFloorArea` came out bigger than `GrossFloorArea`, which `Qto_SpaceBaseQuantities` never allows. `generateSpacesFromWalls` now always computes the inner-face inset separately and passes its area as `netFloorArea`, independent of `boundaryMode`. The shared geometry helpers (`offsetRoomFootprint` and friends) moved unchanged to a new sibling module, `room-footprint-offset.ts`; the package's public exports are unchanged.

- [#3461](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3461) [`a2488e8`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/a2488e858bc7792cdcc818f7759c0a6e46e7d892) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix the default `FILE_NAME` `time_stamp` written by `generateHeader` (used by every STEP export that does not pass an explicit `timeStamp`) and by `IfcCreator.toIfc()`'s header.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3034](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3034) [`75867a7`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/75867a7e6ebf51b2da47cab14242bcd71787ba3b) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add `bim.style`, colour that ends up in the exported IFC.
  
  `bim.viewer.colorize` paints the current view. The colour is an overlay and is gone the moment the model is written out, so a script that wanted a coloured file had to hand-build the `IfcColourRgb → IfcSurfaceStyleShading → IfcSurfaceStyle → IfcStyledItem` chain itself and walk `IfcProductDefinitionShape → IfcShapeRepresentation → Items` to find something to attach it to. `StepExporter` already builds that chain internally for demeshed output; nothing exposed it.
  
  `bim.style.apply(refs, color)` and `bim.style.applyAll(batches)` take any hex form `bim.viewer.colorize` takes — they share its `hexToRgba` — or channels in 0..1. The one deliberate difference is the failure mode: `hexToRgba` degrades an unparseable string to black, which is right for a transient overlay and wrong for something written into the file, so a non-hex string throws instead of being baked in as black.
  
  The work lives in `applyStylesInStore` in `@ifc-lite/create`, beside the other in-store builders, and writes through the same `StoreEditor` overlay as `bim.spaces.generate`. Both headless backends implement it; a backend without direct store access, including the browser viewer's, throws.
  
  Four things the call site no longer has to get right:
  
  **Mapped geometry.** An `IfcMappedItem` is followed through to the `IfcRepresentationMap` and the mapped representation's items are styled, so one style covers every occurrence of a type. On a real MEP model, 139 air terminals share 63 geometry items; styling per occurrence would write a second `IfcStyledItem` on geometry that already had one, which IFC does not allow.
  
  **Geometry that already has a style, including geometry this session styled.** IFC permits at most one `IfcStyledItem` per representation item. The index of existing styles covers both the source file and the overlay: `StoreEditor.addEntity` does not insert into `store.entityIndex`, so a source-only check could not see the session's own writes and a second `apply` over the same products emitted two styled items on one solid — a schema-invalid file, from the very machinery meant to prevent it. That index is also built once per pass rather than per batch, which was 87 ms per batch on a 92k-styled-item model, about two thirds of a colour-by-class run.
  
  **Entities created in the same session.** Reads fall back to the overlay, so `bim.store.addWall(...)` followed by `bim.style.apply` colours the new wall instead of reporting it as geometry-less and leaving an orphan `IfcSurfaceStyle` in the file.
  
  **Schema differences.** `Representation` is resolved by attribute name rather than by a hardcoded index 6, because that slot is `RepresentationMaps` on `IfcTypeProduct` — a list, so a constant index turned a type object into a silent no-op. IFC2X3 gets the `IfcPresentationStyleAssignment` wrapper that IFC4 deprecated. Transparency is rounded, since `1 - 0.9` otherwise reaches the STEP text as `0.09999999999999998`.
  
  A style chain is only left in the file while something references it. Colour a wall red and recolour it green — in a later batch or a later call — and the red chain goes with the styled item it belonged to. What gets swept is tracked as it is authored, per editor, rather than inferred from the overlay: inference could not see `setPositionalAttribute` edits (`getNewEntities` reports attributes as created, while the exporter applies positional mutations on top), so it removed live styles and left the real garbage; it took a chain's shading and colour without checking whether anything else used them; and it collected any overlay `IfcSurfaceStyle` at all, including one a caller had authored with `bim.store.addEntity` and not yet attached. Only chains `bim.style` created are its to remove, and a chain whose styled items were repointed elsewhere is kept rather than risked. A batch that styles nothing writes nothing at all: `surfaceStyleId` is `null`. A caller colouring by IFC class hands in one batch per class, and most classes in a real model — types, ports, spatial structure — reach no geometry, so emitting the style up front left an orphan `IfcColourRgb` / `IfcSurfaceStyleShading` / `IfcSurfaceStyle` per such batch. Found by using the API for a colour-by-class pass: 16 styles in the file where 5 were referenced.
  
  `productsWithoutGeometry` counts a product only when its own walk reached nothing. Deciding it from the growth of the shared item set instead would report every occurrence after the first as geometry-less whenever a type's occurrences share one mapped representation — which is most of them, and was wrong in the first cut of this.
  
  `followMappedItems: false` styles the `IfcMappedItem` per occurrence instead. Following the representation map is right for colouring by IFC class and wrong for any other grouping — by system, storey or property value, shared geometry takes whichever colour ran last and drags unrelated occurrences with it.
  
  `schema` names the schema the chain is built for, defaulting to the store's. The style shape is decided when the style is authored and the export schema is chosen later, so an IFC4 model exported as IFC2X3 otherwise emits `IfcStyledItem.Styles` pointing straight at an `IfcSurfaceStyle`, which that schema does not allow. Converting existing style records during a schema change is a separate job for `StepExporter` and is not attempted here.
  
  An `#rrggbbaa` string's alpha pair is honoured. `hexToRgba` discards those digits and takes alpha from its own argument, which is right for the viewer; here they are the only way the string form can ask for transparency, and dropping them silently wrote an opaque style.
  
  Verified on the export rather than on the overlay, against a fixture carrying direct geometry, two occurrences behind one representation map, a product with no representation, and geometry that already carries a style.

### Patch Changes

- [#3044](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/3044) [`3969c52`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/3969c523063d02e501f421e6b42d1a9a516dc2e4) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Express a wall in the storey frame even when its placement joins the spatial chain above the storey. `extractWallSegmentsForStorey` composes each wall's `PlacementRelTo` hops and stops at the storey's own placement or any of its ancestors, which is right only when the stop is the storey's placement itself. When an authoring tool places the wall against the building's or the site's placement instead, the walk stopped on its first step and returned a frame expressed in that shared ancestor, while every caller reads the result as storey-local — `generateSpacesFromWalls` hands the segments to `addSpaceToStore`, which authors the space with the storey placement as its `PlacementRelTo`, so the storey's own offset and rotation were applied to coordinates they had never been removed from. The walk now records how many of the storey's own placements separate the stopping point from the storey, composes exactly those, and divides them out by their inverse; a stop at the storey's own placement composes nothing, as before. When any placement in that stretch has no readable frame the wall is left where it was rather than moved by a partial chain. This extractor's frame is planar (X/Y plus a ground-plane direction), so what is corrected is the storey's planar offset and rotation; elevation is not part of it. The shape is real in the corpus — all 140 walls of `ara3d/ISSUE_034_HouseZ.ifc` are placed relative to the site placement while contained in its three storeys — though that file's storeys differ from the site only in Z, so none of its segments move. New tests cover a wall on the building placement, a wall on the site placement two hops up, an unreadable storey chain, and the unchanged wall placed directly under the storey; the storey in the fixture is rotated as well as offset, so an inverse applied the wrong way round lands on different coordinates rather than on a sign flip a translation-only fixture would miss.

- [#2993](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2993) [`bb734da`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/bb734da27afbea4b6e595714950cdb195cddeb1f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Compose intermediate `IfcLocalPlacement.PlacementRelTo` hops in wall extraction
  
  `extractWallSegmentsForStorey` read only a wall's own `RelativePlacement` and
  ignored `PlacementRelTo`. That is right for a wall placed directly under its
  storey, but the standard `IfcElementAssembly` grouping (curtain walls, precast
  panel runs, railing systems) inserts an intermediate placement between the
  member and the storey — and its translation and rotation were silently
  dropped, so the member was extracted at the wrong position relative to its
  siblings and the enclosed room was never detected.
  
  Composition stops at the storey's own placement rather than continuing to the
  root, because storey-local is the frame the write side uses: the generated
  `IfcSpace` is authored with the storey placement as its `PlacementRelTo`.
  `existingSpaceFootprintsByStorey` shares that frame and now uses the same
  composition.
  
  A storey with no `ObjectPlacement` — optional on `IfcProduct` — has no chain to stop the composition, so nothing is composed at all for it rather than composing every hop up to the world root and returning world coordinates where storey-local ones are the contract.

### Patch Changes

- [#2769](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2769) [`9fb50eb`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/9fb50ebcfaaf2926b2badd4d4d8dfc6ca55b762f) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Reject non-finite (`NaN`/`Infinity`) dimensions and `Start`/`End` coordinates in `IfcCreator`, the from-scratch STEP builder, instead of silently emitting them into the file.
  
  A bare `value <= 0` check is `false` for both `NaN` and `Infinity`, so those values used to pass every dimension guard and land in the emitted STEP as the literal strings `"NaN"`/`"Infinity"` — not valid STEP REAL tokens. `addIfcColumn` had no dimension guard at all, so a negative or zero `Width`/`Depth`/`Height` passed through too. Every dimension-taking method on `IfcCreator` (`addIfcWall`, `addIfcColumn`, `addIfcBeam`, `addIfcSlab`, `addIfcRoof`, `addIfcGableRoof`, `addIfcDoor`/`addIfcWindow` and their wall-hosted variants, `addIfcRamp`, `addIfcRailing`, `addIfcPlate`, `addIfcMember`, `addIfcFooting`, `addIfcPile`, `addIfcSpace`, `addIfcCurtainWall`, `addIfcFurnishingElement`, `addIfcBuildingElementProxy`, and the I/L/T/U/hollow-section shape methods) now validates through a shared `assertPositiveFinite` helper.
  
  Separately, `addIfcWall`, `addIfcBeam`, `addIfcMember` and the shape-section methods compute a length from `Start`/`End` and only rejected an exact zero-length vector (`Start === End`). A non-finite coordinate makes the computed length `NaN`, and `NaN <= 0` is also `false`, so that guard never fired either — the point is now validated at the source via a new `assertFinitePoint3` helper before any arithmetic runs.
  
  This is the same defect class as `@ifc-lite/create`'s `in-store/` builders fixed in [#2767](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2767) (`assertPositiveFinite` there, and the `beamLen`/`wallLen`/`memberLen` distinct-points gap in `beam.ts`/`wall.ts`/`member.ts`), extended here to `ifc-creator.ts` — a separate, from-scratch builder class outside `in-store/` that shares no code with it — and to the equivalent `Start`/`End` distinct-points gap in those same `in-store/` builders, which [#2767](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2767) left out of scope.
  
  `addIfcColumn`'s new `Height` guard also rejects `0`, which is spec-correct (`IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth` is an `IfcPositiveLengthMeasure`) but is a value adversarial test tooling deliberately constructs to exercise how the geometry pipeline handles degenerate, spec-invalid extrusions. `IfcCreator` now also exposes `addIfcColumnUnvalidated`, a deliberately unvalidated escape hatch for that kind of fixture-building; it is not meant for application code.

- [#2767](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2767) [`ccc38b0`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/ccc38b0de9925a3de1106893a5785117e0e7551d) Thanks [@BIMvoice](https://github.com/BIMvoice)! - Fix the eight in-store element builders that emitted invalid IFC when
  given a `NaN` or `Infinity` dimension instead of throwing.
  
  Every in-store builder (`addWallToStore`, `addBeamToStore`,
  `addDoorToStore`, `addWindowToStore`, `addMemberToStore`,
  `addPlateToStore`, `addRoofToStore`, `addSpaceToStore`,
  `addSlabToStore`) validated its `Width`/`Height`/`Depth`/`Thickness`/
  `FrameThickness` params with a bare `value <= 0` check. That check is
  `false` for both `NaN` and `Infinity`, so those values passed
  validation silently and landed as the literal STEP tokens `NaN` /
  `Infinity` in the emitted `IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` and profile
  attributes — e.g. `addWallToStore({ ..., Height: NaN })` threw
  nothing and wrote an `IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` whose Depth attribute was
  the string `"NaN"`.
  
  `addColumnToStore` already guarded against this — the docstring at
  `column.ts:14` records that the `Number.isFinite` check was added
  while closing the merge-roundtrip gap from LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#592 —
  but the fix never propagated to its eight siblings, each of which
  carries its own copy of the same validation shape.
  
  Rather than copy the guard into eight more places (which is how the
  gap opened in the first place — one copy got fixed, eight did not),
  the check is now a single `assertPositiveFinite` helper in
  `_emit-helpers.ts`, and every builder — including `addColumnToStore`
  itself — calls it. A parametrised test
  (`in-store/dimension-validation.test.ts`) runs `NaN`/`Infinity`/
  `-Infinity`/`0`/`-1` against every dimension field of every builder,
  so a future builder added without the guard fails visibly instead of
  shipping silently.
  
  This is a behaviour change: builders that previously accepted a
  `NaN`/`Infinity` dimension and produced invalid IFC now throw
  `Error('add<Type>ToStore: <Fields> must be positive')` instead. No
  caller in this repository relied on the previous permissiveness —
  every call site passes numeric literals or values already validated
  upstream.

The previous doc recommended `[1, 0, 0]` "for along X", which lies in the profile plane and sweeps the profile into a zero-volume sheet - invalid IFC that meshes to a flat ribbon. To orient an element in the model (e.g. a horizontal pipe), keep the default `[0, 0, 1]` and set `Placement.Axis` instead.

  A location zone (a takt area, a construction section) is emitted as
  `IfcSpatialZone` rather than `IfcZone`: that type groups spaces, so assigning
  walls to one produces a file most readers, this one included, mis-read. Elements
  attach through `IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure`, which is many-to-many and
  additive, so emitting zones never re-parents anything and an element straddling
  two zones can belong to both.

  Boxes emit an `IfcRectangleProfileDef` with any rotation carried in the
  placement; a convex footprint emits the polygon instead. `spatialZonesSupported`
  reports whether the target schema has the type at all, since IFC2X3 does not.

  `IfcRoot.OwnerHistory` is optional from IFC4 onward but mandatory in IFC2X3. `resolveSpatialAnchor` previously resolved `ownerHistoryId: null` for any store missing `IfcOwnerHistory`, regardless of schema, and every in-store builder (`addWallToStore`, `addBeamToStore`, `addSlabToStore`, ...) emits `$` for a null `ownerHistoryId` unconditionally. Editing an IFC2X3 store that itself is missing `IfcOwnerHistory` (a malformed or hand-edited file) therefore silently authored new IFC2X3 elements with `$` in place of a mandatory attribute. IFC4/IFC4X3 stores are unaffected — OwnerHistory is genuinely optional there and `$` is correct.

Replaced with an explicit `byteLength` check.

  No behavior change for real callers: every current call site passes a store this same process just parsed, which always has resident source bytes. Verified with a synthetic empty-source store that the function still fails closed (throws) rather than silently misresolving, in both the old and the new code.

  - `@ifc-lite/data` / `@ifc-lite/cache`: a List-typed property with no value
    came back as `[]` — a real empty list — because the NULL string sentinel
    resolved to `''` and the resulting `JSON.parse` throw was swallowed. NULL
    now reads as `null`, matching the string branch beside it, and a genuinely
    unparseable list value logs once (latched) before falling back to `[]`.
  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `extractWallSegmentsForStorey` silently defaulted to a
    metre length-unit scale when unit extraction threw, mis-scaling every
    extracted wall segment on a millimetre model. It now warns with the error,
    matching `resolveSpatialAnchor` / `resolveDuplicateSource`.
  - `@ifc-lite/cli`: `ifc-lite schema` printed a reduced built-in schema as if
    it were the full SDK surface when `@ifc-lite/sandbox/schema` could not be
    loaded; it now says so on stderr and exits non-zero (stdout is still pure
    JSON, unchanged shape), so a piping caller that discards stderr still sees
    the failure. `--version` no longer reports a hard-coded `0.4.0` when
    `package.json` is unreadable — it reports `0.0.0-unknown` and explains why
    on stderr.
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: the shard and finalise paths that fall back from a
    SharedArrayBuffer view to a materialised (file-sized) copy now say so once
    per worker, matching the streaming-prepass path that already did.

### Major Changes

- [#1979](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1979) [`8f139a8`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/8f139a8ef44235b68c2f97c032419fa586111b62) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **BREAKING:** every `IfcCreator` element constructor now places its product relative to the storey it is added to. Element coordinates are storey-relative across the whole API.

  ## What was wrong

  `IfcCreator` chained the product's `IfcLocalPlacement` to a different parent depending on which method you called. Seven methods — `addIfcWall`, `addIfcSlab`, `addIfcColumn`, `addIfcBeam`, `addIfcStair`, `addIfcRoof`, `addIfcGableRoof` — chained to the storey placement, which carries `[0, 0, Elevation]`. The other 21 — `addIfcDoor`, `addIfcWindow`, `addIfcRamp`, `addIfcRailing`, `addIfcPlate`, `addIfcMember`, `addIfcFooting`, `addIfcPile`, `addIfcSpace`, `addIfcCurtainWall`, `addIfcFurnishingElement`, `addIfcBuildingElementProxy`, `addIfcCircularColumn`, `addIfcIShapeBeam`, `addIfcLShapeMember`, `addIfcTShapeMember`, `addIfcUShapeMember`, `addIfcHollowCircularColumn`, `addIfcRectangleHollowBeam`, `addElement`, `addAxisElement` — chained to the world.

  On a storey with a non-zero `Elevation`, a caller mixing the two families got two datums in one model, with no error and nothing downstream to notice. Measured on a real scan-to-IFC run: the storey and its spaces at −1.368653 m, the walls at −2.737307 m — exactly 2 × the elevation, standing 1.37 m below the spaces they bounded.

  Every one of these methods already took the storey as its first argument and already emitted an `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` into it. Only the placement disagreed.

  ## Why storey-relative, and not world-relative

  The placement hierarchy has to agree with the containment hierarchy. A product contained in a storey whose placement chains past that storey to the world is not a coherent IFC product: moving the storey leaves its own contents behind, and `IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation` and the storey's `ObjectPlacement` become decoration that no geometry honours. The world-relative alternative would have meant deleting the storey's `[0, 0, Elevation]` placement or leaving it as a transform nothing chains to — the wrong half of the schema to surrender.

  It is also what the rest of this package already did: the `*ToStore` builders (`addWallToStore`, `addSpaceToStore`, `addDoorToStore`, …) have always chained from `anchor.storeyPlacementId`. Choosing world would have split `@ifc-lite/create` against itself.

  ## Migrating

  If your storeys all have `Elevation: 0`, nothing moves — the storey placement is the identity and the two parents were already the same point.

  Otherwise, for the 21 methods listed above: **stop adding the storey elevation to element coordinates.** Pass the height above that storey's floor.

  ```ts
  const storey = creator.addIfcBuildingStorey({
    Name: "Level 1",
    Elevation: 3.2,
  });

  // before — absolute Z, because addIfcSpace ignored the storey
  creator.addIfcSpace(storey, {
    Position: [0, 0, 3.2],
    Width: 4,
    Depth: 4,
    Height: 2.6,
  });

  // after — storey-relative Z, like addIfcWall always was
  creator.addIfcSpace(storey, {
    Position: [0, 0, 0],
    Width: 4,
    Depth: 4,
    Height: 2.6,
  });
  ```

  If you compensated for the asymmetry — passing absolute Z to the world-parented methods and storey-relative Z to the storey-parented ones, so the two families lined up — remove the compensation from the world-parented calls only. The storey-parented calls were already correct and must not change. A caller that had settled on `Z = 0` for walls and `Z = elevation` for spaces now passes `Z = 0` to both.

  `addIfcWallDoor` and `addIfcWallWindow` are unaffected: they were and remain wall-local, and inherit the storey datum through their host.

  Also in this release: `getStoreyPlacement` throws `Unknown storeyId #N` instead of silently falling back to the world placement. This is a strictly earlier version of the error `trackElement` already threw a few lines later, so no working call changes — it just means a bogus storey id no longer emits orphan placement entities before failing.

  ## `@ifc-lite/sandbox`

  The `llmSemantics.placement` metadata in `NAMESPACE_SCHEMAS` is corrected to match: the seven methods previously tagged `'world'` (`addIfcMember`, `addIfcPlate`, `addIfcCurtainWall`, `addIfcRailing`, `addIfcDoor`, `addIfcWindow`, `addAxisElement`) are now `'storey-relative'`, and the `useWhen`/`cautions` prose that described them as world-placement is rewritten. The `MethodPlacementKind` union is unchanged and no export was added or removed. Consumers that read `placement` to generate guidance will see different values for those seven methods — which is the point: the old values now describe behaviour that no longer exists.

  Thirteen constructors that carried no `llmSemantics` at all — `addIfcRamp`, `addIfcFooting`, `addIfcPile`, `addIfcSpace`, `addIfcFurnishingElement`, `addIfcBuildingElementProxy`, `addIfcCircularColumn`, `addIfcHollowCircularColumn`, `addIfcIShapeBeam`, `addIfcLShapeMember`, `addIfcTShapeMember`, `addIfcUShapeMember`, `addIfcRectangleHollowBeam` — now declare `placement: 'storey-relative'` with their coordinate keys. They were invisible to every consumer that groups methods by placement frame, so nothing generated from this schema said which datum their coordinates were in. `NAMESPACE_SCHEMAS.create` now tags all 30 coordinate-taking constructors (27 storey-relative, `addElement` explicit-placement, and the two wall-local hosted inserts).

  ## Downstream packages carrying the break

  The behaviour change is not confined to `@ifc-lite/create`: four packages re-expose `IfcCreator` and therefore ship it to their own consumers. Each is versioned to say so, rather than letting a caller pick the change up through a range they believed was compatible.

  - **`@ifc-lite/sdk` (major)** — re-exports the class directly (`packages/sdk/src/index.ts`: `export { IfcCreator } from '@ifc-lite/create'`). Without a major, a consumer on `^1.21` accepts the release and gets storey-relative placement with no signal.
  - **`@ifc-lite/sandbox` (major, was minor)** — `buildCreateMethods()` auto-discovers `IfcCreator.prototype` and dispatches to it, so every affected constructor is reachable from sandbox scripts. A script passing absolute coordinates against a non-zero-elevation storey now emits geometry one elevation off. That is breaking for the script author even though the sandbox's own surface is unchanged.
  - **`@ifc-lite/cli` (minor)** — `create` constructs `IfcCreator` and passes `--elevation` straight through, so the same shift reaches CLI users following the previous absolute-coordinate convention. Minor rather than major because the package is pre-1.0, where the house rule maps a breaking change to a minor bump.
  - **`@ifc-lite/mcp` (minor)** — exposure is indirect but real: `loadIfcModel()` (`src/index.ts`) returns a `LoadedModel` carrying `bim: BimContext` (`src/loader.ts`), whose `create` namespace constructs the class (`@ifc-lite/sdk` `namespaces/create.ts`: `project()` returns `new IfcCreator(params)`, `building()` takes a `StoreyElevation`). A library consumer calling `model.bim.create.building({ StoreyElevation })` gets the new datum. Minor for the same pre-1.0 reason as the CLI.

  `@ifc-lite/wasm` is unaffected — it neither constructs nor re-exports `IfcCreator`, directly or through a namespace. The viewer apps are private and unpublished.

Same seeded source in, identical GlobalIds out - the in-store counterpart of `ProjectParams.GuidSource` from the previous release. Defaults unchanged (platform CSPRNG).

Same options twice yields byte-identical output; defaults are unchanged (wall clock + platform CSPRNG).

They previously cleared the `Number.isFinite` guard and failed much later as a `RangeError` from `toISOString()` while writing the file header; they are now rejected in the constructor, where the error can still name the parameter. Also corrects the `RandomSource` documentation: the unseeded path uses Web Crypto when the runtime provides it and falls back to `Math.random` when it does not, rather than guaranteeing a platform CSPRNG.

  - `@ifc-lite/create`: `IfcCreator` now generates spec-valid 128-bit GlobalIds via the canonical `@ifc-lite/encoding` encoder (previously ~94% of generated ids failed `isValidIfcGuid` and silently changed identity on guid→uuid→guid round-trips, e.g. in BCF).
  - `@ifc-lite/export`: schema-downgrade `IFCPROXY` placeholders now carry spec-valid GlobalIds instead of synthetic `PROXY_…` markers.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser`: `extractLengthUnitScale` now mirrors the canonical Rust extractor when an `IfcMeasureWithUnit` ValueComponent is unreadable — defaults the value to 1.0 and still applies the UnitComponent SI-prefix instead of falling through to metres (property scaling can no longer desync from geometry scaling).
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`: removed the dead legacy worker protocol (`process`/`prepass`/`prepass-fast` messages) — the streaming protocol (`stream-start`/`stream-chunk`/`stream-end` + `prepass-streaming`) is the only path; the wasm `buildPrePassFast` export is gone. Streaming pre-pass loads now apply aggregate void propagation (window/door cuts on aggregated parts) in parity with one-shot loads and the server.
  - `@ifc-lite/server-client`: `ProcessingStats` gains optional `total_csg_failures` / `products_with_failures` fields — the server now reports the same CSG failure diagnostics the browser console shows.

  declared `import` + `types`, so any resolver hitting the CJS/default

  native length unit. Wall, slab, beam, column, door, window, roof, plate,
  and member wrote metre coordinates regardless of the file's length unit —
  an element added to a millimetre model (typical Revit export) serialized
  1000× too small, while its in-session mesh (built separately in renderer
  metres) looked correct until the export round-trip. The duplicate flow
  had the inverse bug: its metre offset was added to the source's
  native-unit location, so a duplicate in a mm file landed ~1000× too
  close (visually on top of the source). Door/window OverallHeight /
  OverallWidth attributes are converted too. Completes the conversion the
  space builder received in [#1029](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/1029) via `SpatialAnchor.lengthUnitScale`.

    reliable entity type instead of the columnar table's `'Unknown'` sentinel
    (every `Curve2D` Axis polyline — e.g. all of AC20-FZK-Haus — was skipped), and
    a body-footprint fallback (face sets, `IfcFacetedBrep`, vertically-extruded
    rect / arbitrary / IndexedPolyCurve profiles) for walls without an Axis.
  - Viewer "Space Sketch" tool: storey list with resolved names, auto-derive on
    selection, auto-escalating + manual snap tolerance to close centreline corner
    gaps.
  - **Headless generation** — derive IfcSpace across storeys from the CLI
    (`ifc-lite generate-spaces`), the SDK (`bim.spaces.generate`), or as a library
    function (`generateSpaces` from `@ifc-lite/create`), with auto-escalating snap,
    storey-datum ("slab") floor-to-floor heights, and rectangular corner cleanup
    ported into the TS detector.
  - **Production-grade baked spaces** — every derived `IfcSpace` now carries
    `Qto_SpaceBaseQuantities` (GrossFloorArea / NetFloorArea / GrossPerimeter /
    Height / GrossVolume, schema-aware) and an `IfcRelSpaceBoundary` per bounding
    wall. Generated spaces are stamped with `ObjectType 'IfcLite:GeneratedSpace'`,
    and a re-run skips a model that already contains them (idempotent; `--force`
    to override).

### Patch Changes

- [#1029](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/1029) [`cef9989`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/commit/cef99897ee287029c6db6bbaafcd2a35508af1be) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - fix(renderer): double-sided GPU pick pass — back-face culling could cull an
  element's entire camera-facing surface (IFC winding order varies), so clicks
  selected whatever was behind it (e.g. an IfcSpace behind a wall).

  fix(create): space bakes now survive the IFC round-trip —
  `addSpaceToStore` emits geometry in the model's native length unit
  (a space baked into a millimetre model used to export 1000× too small),
  and `resolveSpatialAnchor` no longer fails on models without
  `IfcOwnerHistory` (OPTIONAL from IFC4 onward); builders emit `$` instead.

  fix(viewer): Space Sketch surfaces real bake errors instead of counting
  them as "already a space" skips, reveals the (persisted) Spaces class
  visibility after a successful bake, and the toolbar button is edit-mode
  gated with a distinct icon.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces — diagnostics, broader wall coverage, and a sweep of
  review feedback.

  **Auto Spaces detection.** The "no enclosed regions detected"
  failure mode now surfaces actionable counts — both in devtools
  and in the panel itself.

  - `extract-walls.ts` now tries the standard `Axis` representation
    (`IfcShapeRepresentation` with `RepresentationIdentifier='Axis'`,
    `IfcPolyline` items) **before** falling back to the
    `addWallToStore` rectangle-profile convention. That covers
    walls authored by Revit / ArchiCAD / IfcOpenShell — the previous
    extractor only handled walls placed via the Add Element tool.
    The placement chain is read once and the polyline endpoints are
    transformed through it, so rotated walls work.
  - Every wall that gets dropped is recorded with a typed reason
    (`no-axis-or-rect-profile`, `placement-not-resolvable`,
    `zero-length-axis`, …) — the panel summarises them as
    `"3× no-axis-or-rect-profile, 1× zero-length-axis"`.
  - `detectEnclosedAreas` exposes a
    `detectEnclosedAreasWithStats(...)` companion that returns
    per-stage counts (vertices, edges-after-split, faces total,
    outer / below-min-area drops, largest area). The intersection
    splitter's iteration cap now scales with input size
    (`max(100, segments * 10)`) so dense floor plans don't bail
    out early.
  - `generateSpacesFromWalls` always logs a `console.info`
    one-liner and threads a new `debug?: boolean` flag down to the
    extractor + detector for verbose tracing. The viewer's Auto
    Spaces panel exposes a "Verbose console logging" checkbox.
  - The Auto Spaces diagnostic block now shows the graph stats
    (`123v / 456e / 78f`), the drop counts, and per-reason wall
    skips. Two amber hints fire automatically when walls were
    extracted but no faces formed (likely snap tolerance), or
    when nothing extracted (likely an unsupported geometry shape).

  **Review-feedback sweep (PR #598).**

  - `addElementMeshes.linearBox()` and the SVG `linearBoxCorners`
    helper honour each endpoint's Y so a sloped beam previews as
    a sloped prism instead of being flattened to the start.
  - `bridge-store.requireStoreyId` rejects `0` (EXPRESS ids are
    1-based, `#0` is never valid).
  - `addWindow` / `addDoor` `tsParamTypes` include
    `UserDefinedPartitioningType` / `UserDefinedOperationType`
    so typed sandbox callers can hit the IFC4 round-trip without
    casts.
  - `AnnotationLayer.resolveEntityType` no longer falls back to
    `ifcDataStore` when the annotation's `modelId` is missing
    from a federated `models` map (would resolve the wrong
    entity in multi-model sessions). Single-model sessions keep
    the fallback.
  - `addDoorToStore` / `addWindowToStore` validate
    `OperationType` / `PartitioningType` against the IFC4 enum
    and re-route unknown values through
    `.USERDEFINED.` + `User-defined…Type` so custom labels
    round-trip cleanly.
  - `addWallToStore` defaults `PredefinedType` to `.NOTDEFINED.`
    (was `.STANDARD.`) to match the rest of the in-store
    builders.
  - `duplicateInStore` / `resolveDuplicateSource` allow
    `OwnerHistory` to be `null` (IFC4 made it optional). The
    duplicate emits a bare `$` token instead of `#null` for the
    omitted case.
  - `StoreEditor.addEntity` accepts an injected schema-aware
    normalizer (`setEntityTypeNormalizer`); `@ifc-lite/sdk`
    registers `normalizeIfcTypeName` + `isKnownType` at load
    time so direct callers — CLI scripts, sandbox bridge,
    unit tests — see registry-grade rejection of typos like
    `IfcWal`, plus canonical PascalCase on `EntityRef.type`.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces — generate IfcSpace volumes from a storey's walls.

  Pick the **Space** type in the Add Element panel and the new **Auto
  Spaces** section appears underneath the dimensions. Hit **Preview** to
  see every enclosed region the wall graph forms (live SVG overlay,
  labelled with area), then **Generate** to commit one IfcSpace per
  region. Settings: snap tolerance (collapse sloppy wall ends), min area
  (drop closets and slivers), height (extrusion), name pattern, and
  IfcSpaceTypeEnum.

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — three new modules, all parser-pure:

  - `auto-space-detect.ts` — planar-graph face finder. Snap →
    resolve crossings → DCEL half-edge graph → leftmost-turn cycle
    walk → drop unbounded faces → filter by min area. Handles
    multi-component layouts (two non-touching rooms find both),
    T-junctions, and snap-induced corner merges. 8 fixture tests.
  - `extract-walls.ts` — pulls every wall axis on a target storey
    from a parsed `IfcDataStore`. Walks
    IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure → IfcWall → placement chain →
    IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim. Optional overlay reader includes
    walls created via the Add Element tool without a re-parse.
  - `generate-spaces.ts` — orchestration: extract → detect → emit
    via `addSpaceToStore` polygon mode. `dryRun` runs detection only.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — `mutationSlice.generateSpacesFromWalls`
  returns the detection result. `AddElementPanel` gains the Auto Spaces
  section; `AddElementOverlay` projects detected outlines back to screen
  using the storey's elevation so the preview tracks the camera in
  real time.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Duplicate-from-selection — pick any IfcRoot product, hit `⌘D` (or
  right-click → Duplicate), get a fully-functional clone. The
  duplicate is a first-class entity in the property panel, exports
  cleanly to STEP with all its property associations preserved, and
  ships in 6 directional variants sized to the source's bounding box.

  **`@ifc-lite/create`**

  - New `duplicateInStore(editor, source, options)` pure builder.
    Emits a fresh placement chain (`IfcCartesianPoint` →
    `IfcAxis2Placement3D` → `IfcLocalPlacement`) plus the duplicate
    `IfcRoot` with a new GUID and the source's `Representation`
    reference reused (geometry shared). Optional fresh
    `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` anchors to the source's
    storey. Offset is configurable via `options.offset` — the slice
    sizes it to the source's bbox.
  - New `resolveDuplicateSource(store, expressId)` walks the parsed
    `IfcDataStore` for placement / parent / location / storey /
    associations.
  - New `SourceAssociation` shape captures one
    `IfcRelDefines*` / `IfcRelAssociates*` edge that references
    the source. The builder replays each one against the duplicate
    so the exported STEP carries identical psets / qsets /
    materials / classifications / documents / type binding —
    without modifying any existing rel.
  - Resolver scans the five association rel types
    (`IFCRELDEFINESBYPROPERTIES`, `IFCRELDEFINESBYTYPE`,
    `IFCRELASSOCIATESMATERIAL`, `…CLASSIFICATION`, `…DOCUMENT`)
    by direct numeric membership in `RelatedObjects`.
  - `DuplicateBuildResult.associationRelIds: number[]` exposes the
    fresh rel ids for caller introspection.
  - 7 unit tests in `duplicate.test.ts`: full graph emission,
    custom offset, no-storey path, root-placement parent, attribute
    count guard, association replay (3 rel types in one go), and
    the no-associations case.

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`**

  - New `setEntityAlias(overlayId, sourceId | null)` /
    `getEntityAlias(id)` / `resolveBaseEntityId(id)` public surface
    on `MutablePropertyView`. Aliases redirect base property and
    quantity reads from the duplicate to its source — so the
    duplicate inherits psets/qsets without eagerly cloning them
    into the overlay.
  - Override slots stay scoped to the original (overlay) id, so
    edits on the duplicate don't bleed into the source. Verified
    by 4 new unit tests including the source-untouched path,
    chain-cap (one hop, not transitive), and the self-alias guard.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`**

  - New `duplicateEntity(modelId, sourceExpressId, direction?)`
    slice action. Wraps the create-package builder, sets the
    mutation-view alias, and clones the source's mesh data into
    the geometry result with the offset applied — so the duplicate
    appears in 3D the moment the action fires, not just in the
    export overlay. Per-vertex `entityIds` arrays are filled with
    the new globalId so picking and selection resolve correctly.
  - New `DuplicateDirection` type (`+X` / `-X` / `+Y` / `-Y` /
    `+Z` / `-Z`). Magnitude per axis = the source's bounding-box
    dimension on that axis, so a 3m wall steps 3m and a 0.4m
    column steps 0.4m. Falls back to a 1m step when the source
    has no mesh in geometry.
  - Right-click menu's "Duplicate" item is now a `DuplicateRow`:
    primary clickable label on the left (defaults to +X), 6 axis
    chips on the right (→ ← ↗ ↙ ↑ ↓). Tooltips spell out
    "+X (east)" through "−Z (down)".
  - `⌘D` defaults to +X. `⇧⌘D` = +Z (up), `⌥⌘D` = +Y (north) —
    modifier shortcuts for power users without forcing a mouse
    trip to the chip row. Selection moves to the new globalId so
    a Cmd+D chain ("stamp a row of columns") works without
    re-clicking.
  - **`resolveGlobalIdFromModels` two-pass overlay fallback** —
    the federation resolver previously gated each model's id range
    at parse-time `maxExpressId`, which excluded every
    overlay-allocated id from selection. The fix: a second pass
    consults each model's mutation view via `getNewEntity(localId)`
    so overlay duplicates resolve to the right model with the
    right local id. Without this, the property panel saw the
    duplicate as "UNKNOWN / Unknown / no property sets" because
    the alias couldn't take effect on a wrongly-resolved id.
  - PropertiesPanel falls back to the overlay `NewEntity` record
    for type / name / GUID / Description / ObjectType when the
    parsed `entityNode` comes up empty. The bSDD attribute list
    synthesises from the schema-defined positional names. The
    Materials / Classifications / Documents / structural
    Relationships sections all route through a new
    `lookupExpressId` (alias-resolved) so they query the source's
    parsed maps directly.

  After: a freshly-duplicated wall is genuinely first-class — name
  reads, properties show, quantities show, material layers show,
  classifications show, documents show, and a round-tripped STEP
  file carries every association.

  CLI headless backend.

  **Create API** — `IfcCreator` gains `addIfcWorkSchedule`, `addIfcWorkPlan`,
  `addIfcTask` (with inline `IfcTaskTime`), `addIfcRelSequence` (with
  `IfcLagTime`), `assignTasksToWorkSchedule` (`IfcRelAssignsToControl`),
  `assignProductsToTask` (`IfcRelAssignsToProcess`), and `nestTasks`
  (`IfcRelNests`).

  **SDK** — new `bim.schedule` read namespace (`data()`, `tasks()`,
  `workSchedules()`, `sequences()`) backed by the parser's
  `extractScheduleOnDemand`. New `ScheduleBackendMethods` is now part of
  `BimBackend`; the viewer's `LocalBackend`, the `RemoteBackend` proxy, and the
  CLI `HeadlessBackend` all implement it.

  **Sandbox** — new `bim.schedule.*` QuickJS namespace plus schedule methods on
  `bim.create.*`, all carrying LLM semantic contracts so the auto-generated
  system prompt teaches the assistant when to use them. Autocomplete types
  (`bim-globals.d.ts`) regenerated.
