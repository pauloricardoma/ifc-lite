 * 3.0; the others are `undefined`-optional or lean false). This unifies the
 * four hand-rolled xs:boolean parses this package had (`parseVisibility`,
 * `parseViewSetupHints`'s `flag()`, and the two `isExternal` sites in
 * `reader.ts`), which is exactly the drift #3713 warns about: one behaviour,
 * several hand-rolled implementations, each patched independently.
 *
 * A present value outside the lexical space (garbage, e.g. `"yes"`) resolves
 * to `ifUnrecognized` rather than a hardcoded pick, because callers
