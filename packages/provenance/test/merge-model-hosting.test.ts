/**
 * Spatially coupled merge semantics (Bet B4.2, closing the G2 red-team
 * finding in docs/vision/reviews/g2-red-team-2026-07-24.md §4).
 *
 * The finding: merge-model.ts v0 applied every op purely per-node, so
 * node-disjoint ops commuted BY CONSTRUCTION and the spatial half of the
 * conflict predicate could not produce a true conflict even in principle --
 * 35 false and 0 true spatial-only flags in 1,000 schedules.
 *
 * These tests pin the coupling that makes the spatial rule falsifiable:
 * hosted openings must stay inside their host, `geometry-replace` on a host
 * re-cuts its openings, and both of those read state the op does not write.
 * The headline case is the last one in the "does not commute" block: two ops
 * with DISJOINT writtenNodes that genuinely diverge, caught by the spatial
 * rule alone.
