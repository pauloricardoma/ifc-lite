/**
 * Incremental DAG engine for node-hash-v0 (packages/provenance/SPEC.md):
 * memoized recompute through the dependency graph with cache-hit telemetry.
 *
 * `ProvenanceDag` is a thin, store-agnostic wrapper over {@link computeNodeHash}
 * (`./node-hash.js`) that adds a general dependency graph so a caller doesn't have to
 * hand-write "which ancestors does this leaf feed" propagation logic for
 * every DAG shape.
 *
 * A node is either:
 * - a **leaf**: a literal payload with no DAG children (`geometry-mesh`,
 *   `property-set` in practice, though nothing here enforces that mapping —
 *   any kind can be a leaf if its payload doesn't reference other nodes).
 * - a **composite**: a list of child node ids plus a `buildPayload` function
 *   that assembles the kind's payload once every child's CURRENT hash is
 *   known (mirrors spec §3.2's "a child-hash reference is encoded as a
 *   string field holding the child's tagged hash string").
 *
 * `invalidate(nodeIds)` marks the given nodes dirty and transitively marks
 * every ancestor dirty too (a child's hash may have changed, so every node
 * whose canonical bytes embed that child's hash string must be re-derived to
 * find out). `recompute()` then walks ONLY the dirty set, in dependency
 * order, and reports `{ recomputed, cacheHits, hitRate }` telemetry. Nodes
 * never touched by `computeAndStoreHash` in a `recompute()` call are cache
 * hits by construction — this file never re-hashes a node it doesn't have to.
