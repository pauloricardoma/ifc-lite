/**
 * The M4 midterm property battery (Bet B2.1, docs/vision/
 * moonshots-execution-plan.md section 2 M4 exams: "soundness property test,
 * 1,000 randomized two-client op schedules, zero unsound auto-merges (an
 * auto-merge whose replay differs from sequential application), with
 * conflict rate reported").
 *
 * Every schedule: build a randomized base model (seeded PRNG -- mulberry32,
 * the same generator dag-engine.test.ts and g2-footprint-tightness.mjs use;
 * no Date.now / bare Math.random anywhere), have two simulated clients each
 * derive an op set against their own replica of the base, then:
 *
 * - run {@link createCommutationCertificate}. If it certifies, the schedule
 *   was AUTO-MERGED: the certificate's own internal check already replayed
 *   both orders and required byte-identical convergence, and this battery
 *   counts any `apply-failed` / `non-commutative` outcome (predicate said
 *   "safe", replay disagreed) as an UNSOUND AUTO-MERGE. The exam bar is
 *   exactly zero of those across all schedules.
 * - if it refuses with `conflict`, the schedule is FLAGGED. Ground truth is
 *   then computed where computable ({@link attemptBothOrders}): if both
 *   orders replay cleanly AND converge byte-identically, the ops actually
 *   commuted and the flag was a FALSE CONFLICT; if either order fails to
 *   apply or the orders diverge, the flag was a true conflict.
 *
 * Reported rates:
 * - `conflictRate`   = flaggedConflicts / schedules.
 * - `falseConflictRate` = falseConflicts / groundTruthConvergent, where
 *   groundTruthConvergent = autoMerged + falseConflicts (every schedule
 *   whose ground truth is "commutes"). This is the M4 kill-criterion
 *   quantity (plan section 5: below 20% or provable auto-merge is
 *   "technically true but practically annoying").
 *
 * A sample of issued certificates (every `verifyEvery`-th) is additionally
 * pushed through {@link verifyCommutationCertificate}; any failure is
 * reported (and fails the exam -- a certificate that does not verify is
 * worthless).
 *
 * ## Spatial decomposition (Bet B4.2)
 *
 * The G2 red-team review (docs/vision/reviews/g2-red-team-2026-07-24.md §4)
 * showed that under the v0 op model the SPATIAL half of the conflict
 * predicate could not produce a true conflict at all: application was purely
 * per-node, so node-disjoint ops always commuted byte-identically, and every
 * spatial-only flag was false by construction. merge-model.ts now carries
 * host/opening coupling (containment rejection + lazy void re-cut), so the
 * base model here plants real hosts with real openings and the client
 * generator edits both sides of that relationship.
 *
 * To make the finding falsifiable rather than merely re-run, every flagged
 * schedule is classified by WHICH rule fired -- structural-only, spatial-only
 * or both -- and ground truth is tallied per class. The two numbers the B4.2
 * exam turns on are {@link MergeBatteryReport.spatialFiredFalseConflictRate}
 * (over-approximation restricted to schedules where the spatial rule fired)
 * and {@link MergeBatteryReport.spatialOnlyTrueConflicts} (conflicts that
 * ONLY the spatial rule caught -- if that is zero, the rule earns nothing and
 * the pre-committed consequence is to delete it).
 *
 * ## The ablation (G4 review item 6)
 *
 * The G4 red-team review (docs/vision/reviews/g4-red-team-2026-07-29.md §2,
 * §7 item 6) pointed out that the whole soundness argument for the coupled
 * semantics *depends* on the spatial rule, and that an argument of that shape
 * should be tested by removing the rule rather than by counting what it
 * caught. {@link runSpatialAblation} does exactly that: the SAME 1,000
 * schedules (same seed, same generator, same op model), the predicate reduced
 * to structural overlap only, counting the cross pairs the reduced predicate
 * CLEARS that do not actually commute --
 * {@link SpatialAblationReport.unsoundAutoMerges}.
 *
 * Precisely what that count is, since the distinction matters and is easy to
 * overstate: no unsound certificate is ever emitted, in either mode.
 * `createCommutationCertificate` replays both orders itself and refuses on
 * `apply-failed` / `non-commutative` regardless of what the predicate said.
 * The count is the number of times the PREDICATE -- the part of the scheme
 * that decides, and the part this bet is about -- was wrong in the unsafe
 * direction, which is exactly the quantity the M4 exam's "zero unsound
 * auto-merges" bar is stated over (see the head of this docstring). The
 * ablation is measured in the same units as the exam so the two are
 * comparable: 0 with the rule, N without it.
 *
 * Read the result honestly, in either direction:
 *
 * - **non-zero** -- the rule is load-bearing for the PREDICATE, not merely a
 *   conflict counter: every spatial-only true conflict is a pair the reduced
 *   predicate would have waved through. It is NOT load-bearing for the
 *   certificate, which the replay backstop protects either way -- see "What
 *   the spatial rule actually buys" below, which is the statement that should
 *   be quoted.
 * - **zero** -- the predicate needs no spatial half under this op model, and
 *   the rule buys nothing but replay-cost avoidance on schedules that all
 *   commute. That is a real negative result and must be reported as one.
 *
 * The identity `unsoundAutoMerges(ablated) == spatialOnlyTrueConflicts` holds
 * BY CONSTRUCTION and is asserted, not hoped for: a schedule classified
 * `spatialOnly` has no structurally-conflicting cross pair at all (a
 * structural conflict would have been flagged), so the ablated predicate
 * certifies it, and if its ground truth is "does not commute" the certificate
 * is unsound. The ablation is therefore a RE-DERIVATION of that count through
 * the certificate-issuing path, not independent evidence -- which is the point
 * (it is the same fact stated in the units that matter), and it is stated that
 * way rather than presented as a second, corroborating measurement.
 *
 * ## What the spatial rule actually buys (G4 item 7)
 *
 * The sentence above -- "without the rule the predicate clears 9 pairs that do
 * not commute" -- overclaims, and the adversarial re-review of G4 was right to
 * say so. Two corrections, both measured here rather than argued.
 *
 * **1. The rule does not buy soundness of the certificate.** "Zero unsound
 * auto-merges" is guaranteed by {@link createCommutationCertificate}, which
 * replays BOTH orders and refuses on `apply-failed` / `non-commutative`
 * whatever the predicate said. Delete the spatial rule entirely and no unsound
 * certificate is emitted; the ablation's own `certificateFailures: 0` says so.
 * What the rule buys is that the predicate refuses those schedules BEFORE the
 * replay, so the replay backstop never has to run on them:
 * **replay-cost avoidance on 28 schedules, at the price of 19 false
 * refusals** (seed 20260724, 1,000 schedules; `byRule.spatialOnly.flagged` and
 * `byRule.spatialOnly.falseConflicts`). Of the 28, 9 are pairs the replay
 * would have had to catch and 19 are pairs the replay would have certified.
 * That is the honest statement of the trade: a cheap conservative filter in
 * front of an expensive exact check, priced at a 19-in-28 false-refusal rate.
 *
 * **2. The 9 is a property of two modelling choices, and its sensitivity is
 * published with it.** {@link runDerivedCutSensitivity} re-scores the same
 * 1,000 schedules under the 2x2 of {@link MergeSemantics}. Measured, seed
 * 20260724:
 *
 * | cuts / containment | enforced | off |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | lazy (B4.2 default) | **9** (3 apply-failed, 6 diverged) | 9 (0, 9) |
 * | derived (IFC + this repo) | **3** (3, 0) | **0** |
 *
 * (schedule stream pinned to the baseline, so each cell is an attribution of
 * the SAME 9 events. Regenerating the stream under each variant's own
 * semantics gives 3 / 13 / **1**.)
 *
 * So: the G4 reviewers' 9 -> 3 REPRODUCES exactly, by both methods, and their
 * final 1 reproduces under the regenerating method (0 under the
 * schedule-matched one). But their *decomposition* -- "3 from containment, 6
 * from the lazy cut" -- does not hold as a partition. Turning containment off
 * ALONE leaves the count at 9: the three containment rejections become three
 * divergences of the stale cut instead. The stored lazy cut is the dominant
 * mechanism and sustains all 9 on its own; containment is load-bearing only
 * once the cut is derived. Neither number may be quoted without the other.
 *
 * The residual 1 in the regenerated derived/off cell is worth naming, but NOT
 * as a survivor of the 9: the schedule-matched derived/off cell is 0, so none
 * of the original 9 survives both corrections. This one comes from a stream
 * regenerated under derived/off semantics, i.e. it is a different schedule that
 * the baseline never drew. (Corrected 2026-07-29 by the G4 re-attestation,
 * which caught the earlier "the only one of the 9" phrasing as false.) It is
 * worth naming because it is the only conflict in the whole grid with an IFC
 * basis: client A adds an opening hosted in `element:1-8` while client B
 * removes `element:1-8`, so one order applies and the other cannot. That is
 * `IfcRelVoidsElement` referential
 * integrity, which IFC really does impose, and the spatial rule is the only
 * half of the predicate that catches it (the add's `writtenNodes` are fresh
 * ids, structurally disjoint from the remove; only the host-region union in
 * `computeMergeOpFootprint` intersects it).

 * The G4 item 7 sensitivity: how much of B4.2's headline "9 unsound

 *
 * The G4 red-team review's claim, stated precisely so it can be right or
 * wrong: the 9 decompose by mechanism into 3 apply-failures from the invented
 * containment invariant and 6 divergences from the stored (lazy) cut, and so
 * "make the cut eager or derived, as IFC and this codebase do" drops the 9 to
 * 3, and dropping containment as well takes it to 1.
 *
 * Method. The **primary** grid ({@link DerivedCutSensitivityReport.matched})
 * holds the SCHEDULE STREAM at the baseline semantics and changes only the
 * semantics the schedules are scored under. That is what makes the numbers an
 * attribution of the SAME 9 events: `generateClientOps` drops candidates its
 * own replica rejects, so regenerating under containment-off would produce
 * different op sets and a count that cannot be lined up against the baseline's
 * schedule indices. The **secondary** grid
 * ({@link DerivedCutSensitivityReport.regenerated}) does regenerate, which
 * answers the different and also fair question "what would the bet have
 * measured if the model had always worked that way". Both are reported,
 * because quoting only the flattering one is the failure mode this whole
 * exercise exists to correct.
 *
 * Precondition on the `containment: 'off'` column. The footprint soundness
 * argument in `merge-model.ts` (`computeMergeOpFootprint`, "Scope of the
 * soundness argument") holds only under `containment: 'enforced'`: it needs an
 * opening's current bounds to lie inside its host so that an opening op's
 * region necessarily meets a host op's. With containment off, openings may
 * overhang and the predicate under-approximates by construction. The two
 * containment-off cells are therefore measurements of the OP MODEL under a
 * predicate that is not sound for it -- read them as "how much of the count
 * survives this modelling choice", never as soundness measurements of the
 * shipping predicate, and never against the exam's "zero unsound auto-merges"
 * bar, which is defined over the enforced semantics.
 *
 * Nothing here gates: it is a measurement of how load-bearing two modelling
 * choices are, and a sensitivity analysis that could fail an exam would just
 * be an exam.

/**
 * Wilson score interval for a binomial proportion -- the interval to quote on
 * the restricted false-conflict rate, whose denominator (schedules where the
 * spatial rule fired) is small enough that the normal approximation is
 * misleading and small enough that a bare point estimate oversells its own
 * precision. The G4 red-team review computed [28.2%, 54.7%] for 20/49; this
 * function is what the gate script quotes, and a test pins that value so the
 * number in the report is derived rather than transcribed.
 *
 * Wilson rather than Wald: Wald's interval on 20/49 would be symmetric about
 * the point estimate and can leave [0, 1] entirely for extreme proportions,
 * which is exactly the regime a "zero unsound merges" style claim lives in.
