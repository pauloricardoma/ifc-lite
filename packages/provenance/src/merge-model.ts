/**
 * Minimal deterministic op model for the M4 merge soundness contract
 * (Bet B2.1, docs/vision/moonshots-execution-plan.md Phase 2; M4 midterm
 * exam: "soundness property test, 1,000 randomized two-client op schedules,
 * zero unsound auto-merges").
 *
 * footprint.ts declares WHAT an op touches (`EditOp`: target node ids plus an
 * optional world-space region) but deliberately has no semantics -- nothing
 * in B1.4 could apply an op. This module supplies the missing half: a
 * concrete, deterministic model state plus four op kinds (entity add/remove,
 * attr-set, geometry-replace, per the task brief) whose application is a pure
 * function of (state, op). "Byte-identical under the deterministic kernel
 * model" is made literal by {@link canonicalStateBytes}: a canonical,
 * order-insensitive serialization of the state, standing in for the kernel's
 * deterministic output bytes (the real kernel is deterministic by the
 * mesh-determinism manifest; this model inherits the property by
 * construction). Two replicas converge iff their canonical bytes are equal;
 * the Merkle commitment for certificates is {@link hashModelState}, the
 * node-hash-v0 root hash of the state's DAG (same leaf -> element -> storey
 * relationship -> root layer shape as g1/g2 and dag-engine.test.ts).
 *
 * Footprints reuse footprint.ts verbatim for ops whose targets exist in the
 * base DAG (remove/attr-set/geometry-replace); `entity-add` targets ids that
 * do not exist yet, so {@link computeMergeOpFootprint} builds its footprint
 * directly from the op's own fresh node ids (two adds conflict iff they claim
 * the same ids or their regions collide -- exactly the right semantics).
 *
 * ## Spatially coupled semantics (Bet B4.2)
 *
 * v0 of this model applied every op purely per-node: an op read and wrote one
 * node's payload and nothing else. That made node-disjoint ops commute
 * BY CONSTRUCTION -- no schedule could ever fail because of geometry -- which
 * the G2 red-team review (docs/vision/reviews/g2-red-team-2026-07-24.md §4)
 * showed empirically: in 1,000 schedules the spatial half of the conflict
 * predicate produced 35 false conflicts and ZERO true ones, because the op
 * model could not represent the hazard the rule exists for.
 *
 * This version gives the model one real spatial coupling, the smallest one
 * that is unambiguously real in IFC: **hosted openings**. An entity may carry
 * a {@link EntityState.hostId} naming the element it is cut into (an
 * `IfcOpeningElement` voiding an `IfcWall`, `IfcRelVoidsElement` in schema
 * terms). Three consequences, all of which can make an op FAIL or make two
 * node-disjoint ops diverge:
 *
 * 1. **Containment is enforced as an invariant.** An opening must stay inside
 *    its host's bounds. An op that would move/resize a host so that a hosted
 *    opening escapes it, or that would move an opening out of its host, is
 *    REJECTED ({@link SpatialRejectionError}). Rejection reads state the op
 *    does not write -- the host reads its openings' geometry, an opening reads
 *    its host's -- so whether an op applies at all can depend on an edit to a
 *    completely different node.
 * 2. **`geometry-replace` on a host re-cuts its openings.** The host's stored
 *    mesh becomes `proposed base geometry` + a deterministic record of the
 *    voids actually subtracted (each hosted opening's bounds clipped to the
 *    host's, appended to the mesh's vertex list -- see
 *    {@link stripVoidMarkers}). The cut is therefore a function of BOTH the
 *    host's new geometry and the openings' geometry *at re-cut time*.
 * 3. **Cuts are lazy.** Moving, adding or removing an opening does NOT re-cut
 *    the host; the host's recorded cut goes stale until the host is next
 *    edited. So `move host` then `move opening` records
 *    `cut(host_new, opening_old)`, while `move opening` then `move host`
 *    records `cut(host_new, opening_new)`: two ops with disjoint
 *    `writtenNodes` that genuinely do not commute.
 *
 * The conflict predicate stays sound because a host and its openings always
 * overlap spatially by construction (an opening lies inside its host), so any
 * host-op/opening-op cross pair intersects and is refused a certificate. That
 * is the whole point: the SPATIAL half of the predicate is now the only thing
 * standing between the certificate and a real divergence.
 *
 * ### Both couplings are MODELLING CHOICES, and neither is IFC (G4 item 7)
 *
 * An earlier version of this docstring called lazy cuts "exactly as in every
 * BIM authoring kernel" and containment "an invariant, not a convention".
 * Neither survives contact with the schema or with this repository, and the
 * G4 red-team review (docs/vision/reviews/g4-red-team-2026-07-29.md section 2)
 * was right to say so. The claims are withdrawn:
 *
 * - **IFC does not impose containment.** `IfcRelVoidsElement` relates a
 *   `RelatingBuildingElement` to a `RelatedOpeningElement` with no constraint
 *   that the opening lie inside the host. Openings that overhang their host
 *   are ordinary practice, and this repository's own kernel is built for them:
 *   `rust/geometry/src/router/voids/mod.rs` imports `drop_faces_outside_host`
 *   and clips cutters to the host AABB precisely because a cutter routinely
 *   sticks out. A rule the production code works AROUND is not an invariant.
 * - **This codebase does not store cuts; it derives them.** The IFC file holds
 *   the host's UNCUT `Body`, plus `IfcRelVoidsElement`. At load time
 *   `rust/geometry/src/void_index.rs` builds host -> openings and
 *   `rust/geometry/src/router/voids/` subtracts, every time. There is no
 *   stored cut to go stale, so the divergence in point 3 has no counterpart in
 *   the shipping pipeline.
 *
 * The couplings are kept as the DEFAULT of this model, because a model in
 * which nothing couples is the v0 model the G2 review already refuted -- but
 * they are now switchable ({@link MergeSemantics}), and the sensitivity of the
 * B4.2 headline to switching them is measured and published rather than
 * argued. See `merge-battery.ts`'s `runDerivedCutSensitivity`.
 *
 * Wire format: nothing here changes node-hash-v0 serialization. Hosting lives
 * in the model state and in {@link canonicalStateBytes}; the cut is recorded
 * inside the existing `GeometryMeshPayload` vertex arrays, so the frozen
 * `geometry-mesh` encoding hashes it unchanged (a different cut is a
 * different mesh, which is correct). A v1 spec would model hosting as its own
 * `IfcRelVoidsElement` `relationship` node; that is a spec question, not a
 * change this module is allowed to make.

 *   it stale. This is what makes a host edit and an opening edit fail to
 *   commute.
 * - `'derived'` -- the cut is a pure function of the current state: after
 *   every op, every host's mesh is re-materialized as `uncut geometry +
 *   markers(its openings, as they are now)`. This is how IFC works (the file
 *   stores the uncut `Body` plus `IfcRelVoidsElement`) and how this repository
 *   works (`rust/geometry/src/void_index.rs` -> `router/voids/`, at load time,
 *   every load).
 *
 * `'derived'` also subsumes EAGER re-cutting (re-cut the host on every op that
 * touches it or one of its openings): both make the cut a function of the
 * current logical state alone, so both are order-independent, and in this
 * model they produce identical bytes. One mode covers the reviewers' "make the
 * cut eager or derived" because there is nothing to distinguish.

 * Footprint of a {@link MergeOp} against a base state and its structure DAG
 * (`dag` must be `buildStateDag(state)` -- hashes not required).
 *
 * - `attr-set` / `geometry-replace` / `entity-remove` targets exist in the
 *   base DAG, so this delegates to footprint.ts's `computeFootprint`
 *   unchanged (the crux ancestor rule included). `geometry-replace` derives
 *   its region as OLD union NEW mesh bounds (the op touches both where the
 *   geometry was and where it goes); `entity-remove` uses the entity's mesh
 *   bounds.
 * - `entity-add` targets fresh ids the base DAG has never seen, so the
 *   footprint is built directly: writtenNodes = the op's own new node ids
 *   (entity + psets + meshes), region = union of the new meshes' bounds.
 *   Sound by construction: another op can only interact with the add by
 *   claiming one of those very ids (structural intersection) or by touching
 *   space the new geometry occupies (spatial intersection).
 *
 * Hosting (B4.2) adds three rules, which together keep the predicate SOUND
 * under the coupled semantics:
 *
 * - `entity-add` of a hosted opening unions its HOST's current bounds into
 *   its region. Every other opening op is covered without widening, because
 *   the containment invariant puts the opening's CURRENT bounds inside its
 *   host, and every opening op's region already contains those (a move is
 *   old-union-new; a remove is the entity's own bounds) -- so it necessarily
 *   intersects any host op's region, which (by the next rule) always covers
 *   the host's whole box. An `entity-add` has no "old" bounds to lean on: its
 *   geometry is inside the host only if the add is valid, and an add that is
 *   invalid against the base is exactly the case where a missed conflict would
 *   be unsound. The host's box closes that hole and nothing else needs it.
 * - `geometry-replace` on a mesh whose owner HOSTS OPENINGS declares all of
 *   the owner's mesh ids, and unions the owner's whole (uncut) bounds into its
 *   region. Both are needed because {@link recutHost} rewrites every mesh of
 *   the host, with markers derived from every opening the host carries: the
 *   op's writes are not confined to the named mesh, and neither is the state
 *   it reads. The mesh-id half is subsumed by the ancestor closure (all of an
 *   element's meshes share that element node, so two ops on sibling meshes
 *   conflict structurally either way) and is declared for honesty; the REGION
 *   half is load-bearing. Without it, a host with two spatially separated
 *   meshes admits a genuine unsound auto-merge: `geometry-replace` on the far
 *   mesh looks disjoint from an op on an opening sitting next to the near one,
 *   yet the two orders record different cuts. (Not reachable from
 *   `merge-battery.ts`, whose entities carry exactly one mesh each -- so this
 *   rule leaves every published B4.2 number unchanged -- but reachable from
 *   the model's own API, which is what soundness has to be stated over.)
 * - `entity-remove` of a HOST declares its hosted openings' element ids as
 *   additional targets, because applying it deletes them (the cascade in
 *   {@link applyOp}). A write is never left undeclared.
 *
 * ### Scope of the soundness argument: `cuts: 'lazy'` + `containment: 'enforced'`
 *
 * TWO independent preconditions, and each fails for its own reason. Both are
 * stated because the sensitivity grid deliberately runs outside them, and a
 * cell of that grid must never be read as a soundness measurement of the
 * shipping predicate.
 *
 * FIRST, `cuts: 'lazy'`. Under `cuts: 'derived'` {@link applyOp} calls
 * {@link deriveAllCuts} after `entity-add`, `entity-remove` and
 * `geometry-replace`, and that walks EVERY host in the state and rewrites its
 * meshes. So an `entity-add` -- whose footprint declares only the fresh ids
 * the op mints -- writes host mesh nodes it never names, and two adds against
 * different hosts can be judged structurally disjoint while both rewrite
 * geometry. The write set and the declared set part company for the whole
 * state, not for one host, which is why this is a precondition rather than a
 * rule that could be patched the way the `geometry-replace` region was: making
 * `derived` sound would mean every op declaring every host, i.e. abandoning
 * the footprint predicate. `lazy` has no such call, so a write is never left
 * undeclared under the shipping semantics. The grid's `derived` cells score 3
 * unsound auto-merges (matched) against 0 for the lazy baseline, which is this
 * precondition being visible in the data rather than a defect in the bet.
 *
 * SECOND, `containment: 'enforced'`.
 * The argument above leans on the containment invariant in one specific place:
 * "the opening's CURRENT bounds are inside its host", which is what makes an
 * opening op's region necessarily meet a host op's region. That is true under
 * {@link DEFAULT_MERGE_SEMANTICS} because {@link applyOp} rejects every op
 * that would break it. It is NOT true under `containment: 'off'`, where an
 * opening may overhang or sit entirely outside its host: the host op's region
 * (host bounds) and the opening op's region (the opening's own bounds) can
 * then be disjoint while a host re-cut still reads the opening's geometry, so
 * the predicate under-approximates and can clear a pair that does not commute.
 * Making it sound there would mean widening every hosted-opening op's region by
 * its host's bounds as well (the mirror of the `entity-add` rule), which is a
 * different model and is deliberately not what the B4.2 numbers were measured
 * under.
 *
 * So: the footprint rules here are claimed sound for `cuts: 'lazy'` +
 * `containment: 'enforced'`, and for nothing else. Every OTHER cell of
 * `runDerivedCutSensitivity`'s grid -- `derived` by the first precondition,
 * `containment: 'off'` by the second -- is a measurement of the OP MODEL under
 * a predicate that is not sound for it, and must not be read as a soundness
 * measurement of the shipping predicate -- the committed data says as much
 * (`lazyNoContainment` scores 9 unsound auto-merges with the spatial rule
 * ablated, 13 when the schedules are regenerated, against 0 for the enforced
 * baseline).
