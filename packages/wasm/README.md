# @ifc-lite/wasm

Pre-built WebAssembly bindings for the IFClite Rust core, covering STEP parsing and geometry tessellation (including the pure-Rust exact CSG kernel).

> **You probably don't need to use this package directly.** It's the WASM binary plus generated JS/TypeScript bindings that `@ifc-lite/parser`, `@ifc-lite/geometry`, and `@ifc-lite/renderer` consume internally. Reach for it when you want raw access to the Rust core without the higher-level wrappers.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ifc-lite/wasm
```

## Direct WASM use

The text-based entity scanner (`scanEntitiesFast`) takes the raw IFC text
(a `string`) — decode the buffer first; `scanEntitiesFastBytes` takes the raw
`Uint8Array` bytes directly. The geometry methods (`buildPrePassOnce`,
`processGeometryBatch`, see below) also take the raw `Uint8Array` bytes.

```typescript
import init, { IfcAPI } from '@ifc-lite/wasm';

await init();                         // load and instantiate the WASM module

const api = new IfcAPI();
const buffer = await fetch('model.ifc').then(r => r.arrayBuffer());
const content = new TextDecoder().decode(buffer);

// Fast entity scan — returns an array of entity references
const refs = api.scanEntitiesFast(content);
console.log(`Entities: ${refs.length}`);

api.free();                           // free the API instance
```

`api.extrusionDefinitions(bytes, ids)` returns exact authored
`IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` sources and placed product occurrences without decoding
meshes. Omit `ids` for all products, pass `new Uint32Array()` for none, or
selected product STEP IDs for a filtered view. Repeated mapping targets share a source key while each
occurrence retains its f64 `world_from_source` matrix and deterministic ordinal.
Complete sources with valid positive net profile area have
`nominal_quantities` in raw squared/cubed IFC file units; unsupported or
invalid sources have `null`.
For a complete source-profile point, apply `profile_position`, then
`position_matrix`, then `world_from_source`; the last matrix includes file-unit
conversion and maps to absolute IFC Z-up metres. An absent optional `Position`
leaves its matrix field `null`, so use identity for that step when composing
rather than expecting an identity array. Check `status` before interpreting a
null matrix; unsupported sources and bounded output are reported by `status`
and `diagnostics`. CSG operands carry
`source_modified=true` because their final body can differ.

## Meshes (pre-pass + job batches)

Geometry runs as a single pre-pass (one scan that produces a flat job list
plus unit scale, RTC offset, void/style indices) followed by
`processGeometryBatch` calls over slices of that job list. Pass the IFC
**bytes** (`Uint8Array`) to these methods:

```typescript
import init, { IfcAPI } from '@ifc-lite/wasm';

// Your renderer, and your own adapter from a wasm mesh to its mesh type.
declare const scene: { add(m: unknown): void };
declare function toThreeMesh(mesh: unknown): unknown;

await init();
const api = new IfcAPI();
const modelBuffer = await fetch('model.ifc').then(r => r.arrayBuffer());
const bytes = new Uint8Array(modelBuffer);

const pre = api.buildPrePassOnce(bytes);
// Large-coordinate models: pre.needsShift / pre.rtcOffset give the RTC origin.
for (let start = 0; start < pre.totalJobs; start += 100) {
  const end = Math.min(start + 100, pre.totalJobs);
  const jobs = pre.jobs.slice(start * 3, end * 3);
  const collection = api.processGeometryBatch(
    bytes, jobs, pre.unitScale,
    pre.rtcOffset?.[0] ?? 0, pre.rtcOffset?.[1] ?? 0, pre.rtcOffset?.[2] ?? 0,
    pre.needsShift,
    pre.voidKeys, pre.voidCounts, pre.voidValues,
    pre.styleIds, pre.styleColors,
  );
  for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
    const mesh = collection.get(i);
    scene.add(toThreeMesh(mesh)); // mesh.expressId, .ifcType, .positions, .normals, .indices, .color
    mesh.free();
  }
  collection.free();
}

api.clearPrePassCache();
api.free();                           // release the API instance when done
```

### Auxiliary geometry in the mesh frame

Grid, alignment, and symbolic parsers accept the mesh pre-pass decision through
their explicit-frame variants. `RtcFrame` coordinates are IFC Z-up metres:

```typescript
import type { IfcAPI, RtcFrame } from '@ifc-lite/wasm';

declare const api: IfcAPI;
declare const pre: ReturnType<IfcAPI['buildPrePassOnce']>;
declare const content: string;

const frame: RtcFrame = {
  x: pre.rtcOffset?.[0] ?? 0,
  y: pre.rtcOffset?.[1] ?? 0,
  z: pre.rtcOffset?.[2] ?? 0,
  needsShift: pre.needsShift,
};

const grids = api.parseGridLinesInFrame(content, frame);
const axes = api.parseGridAxesInFrame(content, frame);
try {
  const alignments = api.parseAlignmentLinesInFrame(content, frame);
  const symbols = api.parseSymbolicRepresentationsInFrame(content, frame);
  try {
    console.log(grids.length, axes.length, alignments.length, symbols.totalCount);
  } finally {
    symbols.free();
  }
} finally {
  axes.free();
}
```

`needsShift: false` means no RTC subtraction, even when the inactive coordinates
are non-zero. “Raw IFC” here describes only that RTC step: each parser still
applies its documented unit scaling and output-axis conversion. It is distinct
from having no frame.
The methods without `InFrame` remain available for standalone parsing and
detect a frame from the whole source. That standalone choice is not guaranteed
to match an earlier streaming sample or a federation override; reuse the exact
pre-pass frame whenever these results accompany already-produced meshes.

> Most consumers should use [`@ifc-lite/geometry`](../geometry/README.md)'s
> `GeometryProcessor` instead — it wraps this pre-pass/job-batch flow with a
> Web-Worker pool, RTC coordinate handling, and progressive streaming.

## Exports

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `IfcAPI` | Top-level entry point — `scanEntitiesFast` / `scanEntitiesFastBytes` / `scanGeometryEntitiesFast`, `buildPrePassOnce` / `buildPrePassStreaming`, `processGeometryBatch`, `extractProfiles`, `parseSymbolicRepresentations` |
| `MeshCollection`, `MeshDataJs` | Tessellated geometry output |
| `ProfileCollection`, `ProfileEntryJs` | Cross-section profile data (extruded-area solids) |
| `SymbolicRepresentationCollection`, `SymbolicCircle`, `SymbolicPolyline` | 2D symbolic representations (for plan / annotation views) |

All classes implement `free()` and `[Symbol.dispose]()` — call `free()` (or use `using`) to release Rust-side memory.

## When to use a higher-level package instead

| You want… | Use |
|---|---|
| A typed, idiomatic TS API for parsing | [`@ifc-lite/parser`](../parser/README.md) |
| Streaming geometry with worker support | [`@ifc-lite/geometry`](../geometry/README.md) |
| WebGPU rendering | [`@ifc-lite/renderer`](../renderer/README.md) |
| To avoid managing WASM lifecycles by hand | Any of the above |

For appearance authoring, `IfcAPI.catalogAppearance` resolves current IFC product
classes and type memberships from an effective STEP snapshot before planning.
It shares bounded native decoding with `planAppearance`; run both in a worker and
validate the source revision before using a catalog or applying a plan. See the
[WASM API guide](../../docs/api/wasm.md#effective-appearance-scope-catalog) for the
request, response and limits.

`IfcAPI.planPageAppearance(content, requestJson, rgba)` adds a bounded finite-page
compositor. It returns an `IFPA` metadata/PNG envelope with per-item digest-named
assets and ordinary atomic IFC edits. Outside-page albedo is resampled from the
original canonical style/texture, not a repeated or clamped page border. Run in
a cancellable worker and retain all generated assets with the command. See the
[WASM API guide](../../docs/api/wasm.md#finite-page-appearance-output).

`IfcAPI.planAnnotationPlane` creates a bounded calibrated image `IfcAnnotation`
plan for an explicit spatial container, reusing canonical native geometry. Run it
in a worker and publish its typed entities, source-image lease and returned mesh
as one existing model/history transaction. See the [WASM API guide](../../docs/api/wasm.md#calibrated-annotation-creation)
for the Z-up geometry/top-down UV and allocator/source validation contract.

`IfcAPI.planCapturedMesh` creates a bounded `IfcBuildingElementProxy` plan from
an already segmented textured triangle mesh, retaining independent UV seams and
the original image URI. It uses the same native authoring and geometry path as
annotation creation. See [captured surface creation](../../docs/api/wasm.md#captured-textured-surface-creation)
for coordinate, budget and atomic host-commit requirements.

Captured-mesh planning preserves optional `repeatS`/`repeatT` image sampler flags
(default `false`); UVs remain bounded to `[0, 1]`.

`IfcAPI.registerScanCorrespondences` fits bounded manual source-scan/IFC point
pairs and returns a proper rigid transform plus separate fitting and held-out
residuals. Frames and asset identities are bound into the report; the call does
not align a loaded model or approve scan accuracy. See the
[registration contract](../../docs/api/wasm.md#scan-correspondence-registration).

`IfcAPI.planMeshTransfer` composes registered opaque textured-mesh observations
onto supported direct IFC tessellations using the shared atlas planner. Unknown
samples retain existing target albedo; the IFPA response includes explicit
coverage and frozen-input bindings. Entirely unknown transfer has no applicable
plan. See the [transfer contract](../../docs/api/wasm.md#registered-textured-mesh-appearance-transfer)
for source identity, coordinate frames, budgets and host acceptance requirements.

`IfcAPI.preparePdfVectorPage` validates bounded ordered PDF vector graphics states
and preserves source operator identity, calibrated transforms and paint state.
Content the planner cannot convert (text, images, clips, transparency,
patterns, unqualified dashed strokes, curved/hairline strokes, unknown operators) is returned
as a fidelity report with counts, page extents and visibility, and an
`exact`/`rasterOnly` verdict; `IfcAPI.planPdfFillAnnotation` plans a partial
page only when the request quotes that report's digest as the user's
acceptance. It emits no IFC entities and makes no flattened-geometry fidelity
claim; see the
[preparation contract](../../docs/api/wasm.md#pdf-vector-graphics-state-preparation-and-fidelity-report).
Qualified positive dash patterns on open and closed straight subpaths preserve
phase, odd-array repetition, subpath reset, joins across vertices and run caps.
The closing edge participates in the pattern. PDF 1.0–1.7 retain caps where the
first and last on-dash pieces meet at the closure seam; PDF 2.0 joins them.
PDF.js's effective format version is bound into the page DTO; an unknown version
reports `dashVersion`, and a PDF 1.x dash covering the complete closed perimeter
reports `dashTopology`. Explicit close-path and close-and-stroke operators share
the versioned behavior.
Combined fill and dashed-stroke paints can still refuse atomically when
multiple run boundaries produce crossings outside the current fill-region
qualifier.
