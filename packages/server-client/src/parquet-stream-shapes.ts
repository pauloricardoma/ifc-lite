/**
 * The client half of cross-batch shape sharing on
 * `POST /api/v1/parse/parquet-stream?stream_shapes=cross-batch` (issue #5407).
 *
 * On that stream a batch carries only the shapes no earlier batch did, and its
 * mesh rows index the vertex and index rows of the WHOLE stream so far. So the
 * reader keeps every batch's vertex and index columns, appended in order, and
 * builds each batch's meshes against all of them. What it keeps is the
 * stream's distinct shape geometry, sent once, which is what makes the stream
 * small in the first place; occurrences are materialized per batch and handed
 * off exactly as before.
 *
 * Each batch states where its tables start (`vertex_base`, `index_base`). The
 * store refuses a batch whose base is not what it holds, so a dropped or
 * reordered batch fails loud instead of drawing one shape's vertices for
 * another. It also refuses a batch number out of sequence: a batch that
 * brought no new shapes leaves the bases where they were, so only its number
 * shows that it went missing or arrived out of order. A batch WITHOUT bases came from a server that did not honour the
 * opt-in and decodes on its own, as every batch did before.
