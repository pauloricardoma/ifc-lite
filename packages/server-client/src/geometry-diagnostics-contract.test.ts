/**
 * COMPILE-TIME contract test: this package's `GeometryDiagnostics` must stay
 * structurally identical to the canonical one in `@ifc-lite/geometry`.
 *
 * The two copies drifted silently for three releases (#3857): the server-client
 * copy never grew `schemaVersion`, `worstHosts.bbox`, `worstHosts.triangleCount`
 * or `oversizedRefDrops`, so a consumer reading a field the Rust server does
 * serialize got a type error and reached for a cast. Prose saying "keep these in
 * sync" is what failed; this file is the executable version of that sentence.
 *
 * HOW IT FAILS. The assertions below are type-level, so they are checked by
 * `pnpm typecheck` (scripts/typecheck-tests.mjs builds a program over the test
 * files), not by running this file. A field added to, removed from or retyped on
 * either side breaks the build. The runtime `expect` exists only so the file is
 * a visible test rather than a silent one.
 *
 * WHY A RELATIVE SOURCE IMPORT. `@ifc-lite/geometry` is deliberately NOT a
 * dependency of this package - see the header of `geometry-diagnostics-types.ts`
 * for why. A type-only relative import of the canonical module needs no
 * dependency edge and no built `dist/`, and `import type` is erased, so nothing
 * from the geometry package is loaded at runtime. Precedent:
 * `packages/sdk/src/sandbox.test.ts`.

 * `totalUnsupportedItems` / `unsupportedItemsByType` to the canonical type, so

 *
 * This list is self-retiring: `AheadFieldsAreNotYetCanonical` below fails the
 * moment `@ifc-lite/geometry` gains one of these names, which is the signal to
 * delete the name from here. An entry that is merely convenient does not belong
