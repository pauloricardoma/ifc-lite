/**
 * The shared-shape flat Parquet layout is OPT-IN on the server (issue #3888):
 * it renders wrong on a client that predates it, and the flat wire has no
 * version byte such a client could fail loud on, so the server produces the
 * older layout unless the request says `parquet_layout=shared-shapes`.
 *
 * This version's decoder applies `rot0..rot8`, so it opts in — and it has to do
 * so on EVERY endpoint that touches the geometry cache, because the two layouts
 * are stored under separate keys. A cache check that forgets the signal reports
 * on the wrong entry: it would answer "cached" for a v5 blob and the client
 * would then skip the upload and fetch a layout it did not ask for, or answer
 * "not cached" for a file whose shared entry is sitting right there.
