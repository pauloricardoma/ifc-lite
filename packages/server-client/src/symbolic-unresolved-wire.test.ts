 * The server side of `symbolic_data` uses `f32::NAN` as a sentinel meaning
 * "this elevation / cross-hatch angle was never resolved". JSON has no NaN, so
 * it reaches this client as `null` — and `null` is emphatically NOT `0`, which
 * is a real elevation at datum.
 *
 * The payload under test is NOT hand-written here. It is emitted by the actual
 * Rust serializer (`rust/processing/tests/symbolic_nan_sentinel_json_roundtrip.rs`,
 * `the_typescript_wire_fixture_matches_what_the_serializer_emits`) and checked
 * in; that test fails if the wire drifts from these bytes, so a format change
 * cannot land on one side only.

 * `expect(admitsUnresolved).toBeNull()` would assert a value against itself
 * and could never fail regardless of what `world_y`'s real type is — that
 * runtime assertion has been removed as vacuous.
 *
 * Note this package's tsconfig excludes `*.test.ts` from `tsc`/`typecheck`,

 * for whoever narrows `world_y` back to `number`, not a gate this suite can
