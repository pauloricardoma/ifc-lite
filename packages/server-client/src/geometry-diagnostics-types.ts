/**
 * The CSG / opening diagnostics wire shape of the parse response.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A COPY. `@ifc-lite/geometry` owns the canonical
 * `GeometryDiagnostics` (packages/geometry/src/diagnostics.ts), and re-exporting
 * it would be the obvious way to have one definition. This package deliberately
 * ships with an empty `dependencies` map: it is the thin HTTP client, usable in
 * a browser or a Node service that never loads the geometry stack, and
 * `@ifc-lite/geometry` pulls in `@ifc-lite/wasm` (a cargo/wasm-pack build) plus
 * `@ifc-lite/data`. A type-only import would not stay type-only either -
 * declaration emit writes the cross-package reference into `dist/index.d.ts`,
 * so every consumer would have to have the geometry package installed to
 * typecheck. The copy is the cheaper trade.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS THE COPY HONEST. `geometry-diagnostics-contract.test.ts` compares
 * this interface with the canonical one field by field at COMPILE TIME, so a
 * field added on either side fails `pnpm typecheck` instead of drifting the way
 * this file drifted through #3691, #3752 and #3766 (issue #3857).
 *
 * Split out of `types.ts` under the module-size ratchet, following the
 * `symbolic-types.ts` precedent (#3199); `types.ts` re-exports it, so the
 * package's public surface is unchanged.
 *
 * Field names are camelCase because the Rust producer's `rename_all` says so -
 * unlike the snake_case response envelope this type sits inside.

/**
 * CSG / opening diagnostics for a geometry pass. Mirrors the Rust
 * `GeometryDiagnostics` (camelCase serde) the server and the WASM batch path both
 * emit. `totalCsgFailures` and the classification counts are exact;
 * `productsWithFailures`, `hostsWithOpenings` and `silentNoOps` are batch-summed
 * upper bounds.

  /**
   * Contract version handshake (mirrors Rust
   * `GEOMETRY_DIAGNOSTICS_SCHEMA_VERSION`, currently 3). Bumped on field
   * renames/removals and count-semantics changes; also on an additive field
   * whose absence a consumer must tell apart from a real zero, which is why 3
   * (added `totalUnsupportedItems`) bumped. A purely additive optional field
   * that no consumer gates on does not bump. Kept worded the same as the
   * canonical copy in `@ifc-lite/geometry`: the structural contract test cannot
   * see comments, so a rule stated two ways here is drift nothing catches.
   *
   * REQUIRED, not optional: the Rust field is a plain `u32` serialized
   * unconditionally, so every producer since #1514 writes the key. A value of
   * `0` is what Rust's `#[serde(default)]` yields when it READS a payload
   * written before #1514, and is the only "pre-versioned producer" signal a
   * consumer sees.
