/**
 * Per-instance rotation, shared by both Parquet transports (issues #3575, #3888).
 *
 * Split out of `parquet-tables.ts` to stay under that file's module-size
 * budget (see `parquet-columns.ts` for the same reasoning applied to the
 * shared trailing columns).
 *
 * The server dedupes rotated `IfcMappedItem` / shared-`IfcRepresentationMap`
 * occurrences by storing ONE template mesh in a canonical/local frame and
 * carrying each instance's rotation (row-major 3x3, `rot0..rot8`) alongside
 * its `origin_x/y/z`. The optimized transport has done this since #3575 and the
 * flat one since `-parquet-v6` (#3888); the columns, the frame and the
 * reconstruction are identical, which is why this module is shared rather than
 * copied. Reconstruction contract:
 * `world = origin + R * template_position` — the SAME `origin`-only contract
 * as before (#1841) when `R` is the identity, which is what the server emits
 * for every instance it did not verify a rotation-aware placement for.

 * blob (#3888). Callers then fall back to the identity rotation, which is
 * exactly the behaviour those payloads were written for.
 *
 * `onAbsent` says what a MISSING or short block means to the caller, in the
 * caller's own terms rather than in one transport's version numbering.
 * `'identity'` is the reading above. `'throw'` is for a payload whose own
 * header states the columns are there: the optimized format's version 3 is
 * only emitted once a non-identity rotation has actually been written
 * (`optimized_wire_version` in `parquet_instancing.rs`), so absence there is
 * truncated wire data, and decoding it as identity would place a genuinely
 * rotated occurrence at the wrong orientation with no signal why.
 *
 * The flat transport has no such header — it cannot tell a truncated v6 mesh
 * table from a genuine v5 one — so it passes `'identity'`, which is right for
 * the v5 case and no worse than throwing for the other.

 * so this costs nothing beyond the identity check for meshes #3575 did not
 * touch.
 *
 * Normals get the SAME rotation matrix as positions, not its inverse
 * transpose — correct for a rigid (orthogonal) rotation, which is what the
 * server's per-vertex residual check (`RECOMPOSITION_TOLERANCE_M`) verifies
 * before emitting a non-identity row. A non-uniform scale baked into the
 * source `IfcCartesianTransformationOperator` would need the inverse
 * transpose for normals specifically; this matches the convention the
 * existing GPU-instancing wire format (`ifc_lite_geometry::instancing`)
 * already uses, so it is not a new approximation this fix introduces.
 *
 * `isIdentityRow` already refuses to call a row with a NaN cell "identity"
 * (`NaN !== 1` is true, so the row fails the comparison and falls through
 * here) — a NaN can never silently render as an unrotated placement. But
 * multiplying it through `rotateTriplets` would still corrupt every vertex
 * of THIS instance to NaN, uncontrolled: no error, a mesh that may vanish
 * or wreck a shared bounding-box computation with no signal why. A row that
 * isn't finite is malformed wire data — the same class of fault
 * `buildMeshesFromOptimizedTables` already fails loudly on for a bad
 * mesh/material index — so it throws here too, instead of writing NaN
 * silently into the buffer.
