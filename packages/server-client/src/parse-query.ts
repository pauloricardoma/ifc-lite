/**
 * The query string every parse-family request carries.
 *
 * Its own module because it encodes a SAFETY contract, not just formatting.
 * `flatLayout` opts this client in to the server's shared-shape flat Parquet
 * layout (issue #3888): the server produces the older layout unless asked,
 * because the shared one renders wrong on a decoder that ignores its
 * `rot0..rot8` columns and the flat wire has no version marker such a decoder
 * could reject. This version's decoder applies them, so it opts in.
 *
 * The two layouts are cached under separate server-side keys, which is why the
 * signal has to go on EVERY endpoint touching that cache — both parse routes,
 * the cache check and the cached-geometry fetch. One that forgets it asks about
 * the other entry. Pinned by `parquet-layout-signal.test.ts`.
 *
 * The streaming route takes one more opt-in, `stream_shapes=cross-batch`
 * (issue #5407), for the same reason one level down: with it a batch's mesh
 * rows may point at vertices an EARLIER batch carried, which a client decoding
 * each batch on its own would read out of range. This version's stream reader
 * keeps earlier batches' shapes, so it opts in; see `parquetStreamQuery`.
