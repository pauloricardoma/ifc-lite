/**
 * Shared hosted-GPU device-loss handling for viewer E2E specs (#6232 F3).
 *
 * CI runs Chrome on SwiftShader WebGPU (`E2E_GPU_STRICT=0`), and Dawn can drop
 * that device at any moment ("A valid external Instance reference no longer
 * exists.", reason `unknown`). Once it does, the viewer stops drawing and never
 * uploads the model's meshes, so any step that needs rendering (a scene face
 * hit, a GPU pick, a colour frame) fails for a reason that has nothing to do
 * with the change under test. Specs used to hand-roll a console listener and a
 * skip around one step each, and a step they missed (the face search in
 * mobile-long-press) flaked unrelated PRs.
 *
 * The signal is the viewer's own fault path, not a guess:
 * - `[WebGPU] Device lost: … (reason: …)` from packages/renderer/src/device.ts,
 *   with ANY reason. CI's traces show Dawn reporting an instance drop either
 *   as `unknown` ("A valid external Instance reference no longer exists.") or
 *   as `destroyed` ("Device was destroyed."), and in the second shape that is
 *   the ONLY loss line the page logs (run 36602083993: mobile-long-press and
 *   the swept-disk specs). The renderer treats `destroyed` as a teardown and
 *   does not recover, so the view stays dead either way: every reason counts
 *   as a loss here. A teardown line on a healthy page cannot turn a failure
 *   into a skip, because `requireLiveGpu` and the per-spec guards skip only
 *   after the rendering-dependent step has itself failed (the one exception,
 *   `skipIfLost`, is an explicit pre-check a spec opts into),
 * - `[Renderer] GPU device lost` from the renderer's `handleDeviceLost`,
 * - `[Viewport] GPU device lost:` and its toast from
 *   apps/viewer/src/components/viewer/device-loss-report.ts,
 * - the follow-on Dawn errors the loss produces (`popErrorScope rejected
 *   (device likely lost)`, `A valid external Instance reference no longer
 *   exists`).
 *
 * Skips happen only when `E2E_GPU_STRICT=0` and loss evidence exists; a strict
 * run (a real GPU) never skips and still fails, with the loss evidence
 * annotated.
 *
 * `E2E_FORCE_DEVICE_LOSS=1|destroyed` reproduces the CI fault in any spec that
 * calls {@link watchGpuDeviceLoss}: the first WebGPU device is destroyed right
 * after the viewer gets it and reports a loss with reason `unknown` (`1`) or
 * `destroyed` (`destroyed`, the shape that broke the first version of this
 * helper), and every later `requestDevice` rejects, so recovery fails the way
 * it does after Dawn drops the instance.
