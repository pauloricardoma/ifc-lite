/**
 * In-page frame probe shared by both frame-time rigs (#6960).
 *
 * Installed with `page.addInitScript(installFrameProbe, config)` BEFORE the
 * viewer boots, so it is app-agnostic: no viewer code knows it exists. It
 * wraps `requestAnimationFrame` (every rAF callback of one frame is folded
 * into one record keyed by the frame timestamp) and patches the WebGPU
 * prototypes the renderer calls, so a frame record says how much JS ran in
 * that frame's rAF callbacks and how much GPU work it encoded:
 *
 *   presents   `GPUCanvasContext.getCurrentTexture` calls. The viewer's loop
 *              re-arms rAF every frame but renders only when dirty, so a frame
 *              with `presents > 0` is a RENDERED frame and one without is IDLE.
 *   submits    `GPUQueue.submit` calls; `draws` every draw* on a render pass.
 *   writeBytes `GPUQueue.writeBuffer` payload bytes (uploads, uniforms).
 *
 * GPU work issued OUTSIDE any rAF callback (streaming uploads from a worker
 * message handler) is attributed to the next frame's `outside*` fields.
 *
 * `workDone: true` also measures `GPUQueue.onSubmittedWorkDone()` latency
 * once per frame that submitted: time from the end of that frame's rAF
 * callbacks to the queue reporting the work finished. That is queue latency
 * plus GPU execution, NOT a GPU timestamp; it is meaningful only on a real
 * GPU and the deterministic (SwiftShader) rig leaves it off.
 *
 * Everything below must stay self-contained: Playwright serialises the
 * function source into the page, so it may not reference module scope.
