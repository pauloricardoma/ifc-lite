# Emitting location zones as IFC entities (design)

**Status:** decided and built. The property/quantity write-back ships (#2508
item 3b), and so does the `IfcSpatialZone` emission this document argued for:
`packages/create/src/in-store/spatial-zone.ts` for the schema half,
`apps/viewer/src/lib/zones/emit-spatial-zones.ts` for the frame half.
`IfcZone` emission remains **refused** on schema grounds.

Issue #2508 asks the question rather than assuming the answer: "Whether
user-drawn takt boxes *should* become `IfcZone` is a genuine modelling
question, not an obvious yes". This is the argument.

## What a location zone is

A zone (`apps/viewer/src/lib/zones/types.ts`) is a user-drawn oriented box in
the **viewer's** world frame: a construction section, a takt area, a delivery
sequence. It has a name, a colour, a stable id, and no relationship to the
model's spatial structure. Elements are classified into it geometrically, by
where their geometry actually is, and an element can be in several zone sets at
once ("Section 2" and "Takt Area B").

Three properties matter for what follows:

1. A zone is **not a room**. Nothing bounds it, nothing was designed to it, and
   it usually cuts through walls and slabs rather than following them.
2. An element can belong to **several zones at once**, which is the entire
   point of #2508: the straddlers are the interesting population.
3. Zones are **planning state**, not design state. They change when the
   programme changes, several times a week, and two people planning the same
   building will draw different ones.

## `IfcZone`: no

`IfcZone` is a grouping of **spaces**. Its `IsGroupedBy`
(`IfcRelAssignsToGroup`) accepts `IfcSpace`, `IfcSpatialZone` and nested
`IfcZone` only; a wall is not an admissible member. This repo already reads it
that way: `extractGroupMembersOnDemand`
(`packages/parser/src/on-demand-extractors.ts`) documents an `IfcZone`'s
members as the `IfcSpace` / `IfcSpatialZone` ones, and the GROUPS panel (#1672)
browses them on that assumption.

So emitting takt boxes as `IfcZone` with walls and slabs assigned to them
produces a file that our own reader would mis-describe and a validator would
reject. The attraction is only that the word matches; the semantics do not.
Refused.

## `IfcGroup`: possible, and it says nothing

`IfcRelAssignsToGroup` onto a plain `IfcGroup` accepts any
`IfcObjectDefinition`, so the schema permits assigning walls to a group named
"Takt Area B". It is the unconstrained fallback, and that is also its problem:
a plain group carries no spatial meaning, so a receiving tool learns that these
elements are *associated*, not that they occupy a *region*. It also cannot
express a straddler honestly, because group membership is a yes/no while a
straddling wall is 40% one and 60% the other.

Worth having only if a specific downstream consumer asks for groups. It is a
transport, not a model.

## `IfcSpatialZone`: yes, and it is a separate PR

`IfcSpatialZone` (IFC4) is exactly this concept: a spatial region that is
"not necessarily bounded by physical elements", intended for thermal,
lighting, occupancy and **construction** zones, with a `PredefinedType` that
includes `CONSTRUCTION`. It carries an `ObjectPlacement` and a
`Representation`, so the box a user drew can be emitted as geometry rather than
described in prose. This repo already surfaces it (#1094, #1075).

Two schema details make it fit where `IfcZone` does not:

- Elements are attached with **`IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure`**, which is
  many-to-many and *additive*. It does not disturb
  `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure`, which is exclusive and holds the
  building's real hierarchy. The parser already indexes the referenced
  relation (`packages/parser/src/columnar-parser-indexes.ts`), so a file we
  emit is a file we can read back.
- A straddler can be referenced in **both** zones, which is the truthful
  statement of the topology.

### What it does not solve

Referencing says *this element reaches this zone*. It cannot say *this element
is 40% in this zone*, which is the number #2508 exists to produce. So an
`IfcSpatialZone` emission is complementary to the quantity write-back, never a
replacement for it: the zone entity carries the region, the quantity set
carries the split.

### Why it took its own PR

Each of these was a reason to defer it, and each is now a property of what
shipped:

- It writes new **spatial** entities into someone else's model, which is a
  heavier act than adding property sets. So it is a separate, explicitly
  labelled button, and its inverse removes exactly what it wrote.
- It needs a placement chain and a swept-solid representation in IFC **Z-up**,
  converted out of the viewer's Y-up frame. That conversion is the part only
  the viewer can do, and it is the part that fails invisibly, so it lives in
  one exported function with a test per shift
  (`emit-spatial-zones.test.ts`). A model federation alignment re-based is
  refused rather than written by another file's origin.
- Zones change several times a week (property 3 above). Baking planning state
  into a design model stays a deliberate act: nothing emits on load, on
  assignment, or on export.

## What ships instead, and why it is the right default

The property and quantity write-back (#2508 item 3b,
`apps/viewer/src/lib/zones/writeback.ts`):

- is **additive and reversible**: it touches no spatial structure and the panel
  removes exactly what it wrote;
- expresses the straddler honestly, as a per-zone volume breakdown that sums to
  the whole;
- lands in the one place every downstream tool already looks, which is what the
  reporter of #1763 was doing by hand in a spreadsheet.

## What the `IfcSpatialZone` emission does

- One `IfcSpatialZone` per zone, `PredefinedType = CONSTRUCTION`, `LongName` =
  the zone set's name, `Name` = the zone's name. **Nine** attributes, not ten:
  the type derives from `IfcSpatialElement` rather than
  `IfcSpatialStructureElement`, so it has no `CompositionType` - which is the
  schema saying a zone is not part of the containment hierarchy.
- An **absolute** placement (`PlacementRelTo = $`) rather than one chained to
  the site: the zone's coordinates are world coordinates already, because the
  mesh pipeline resolved every placement chain to world before the user drew
  the box against it. Inverting that chain to recover a local offset would be
  arithmetic with nothing to gain.
- Representation as an extruded rectangle profile carrying the zone's rotation
  in the placement rather than in the profile, so a receiving tool reads a
  rectangle as one. The viewer's `rotationY` becomes `RotationZ` on the way in:
  the output is Z-up, and the axis swap flips the sign with it. A prism zone emits its convex footprint as an
  `IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef`, with the points made relative to the
  placement.
- `IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure` per zone, listing every element the
  assignment says it touches (not just the elements whose home it is).
- Emitted alongside the property sets, never instead of them.

Not done, and deliberately: aggregating the set's zones under one `IfcZone`.
That is admissible once every member is an `IfcSpatialZone`, and it is the one
legitimate use of `IfcZone` here, but nothing yet asks for the extra grouping
level.

### How a re-run finds its own zones

Each emitted zone carries `IfcRoot.Description = "IfcLite zone set <id>"`, the
zone set's stable id. A re-run sweeps by that rather than by the set's name, so
renaming a set between runs replaces its zones instead of leaving a second,
obsolete copy under the old name. The name still goes in `LongName`, which is
what a receiving tool shows.

The limit that remains: the sweep only touches entities THIS SESSION created.
Zones from a re-imported earlier export are left alone and would be duplicated,
which is what keeps a later run from gutting a model that already contains
zones.
