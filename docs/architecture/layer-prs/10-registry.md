# 10: Layer Registry

## 10.1 What it is

Content-addressed store + ref database + policy engine + review/PR objects + audit index. Substrate: extend `packages/collab-server` and `apps/server` (auth, websocket, persistence already exist). Protocol: plain HTTP push/pull of layers by id (dumb storage, smart client), websocket events for reviews.

## 10.2 Open core split (deliberate Git/GitHub split)

- **MPL-2.0, forever**: layer format, manifest spec, diff, merge, CLI, MCP tools, single-user/local refs, the GitHub Action
- **Paid (extends the Tauri CHF 19/month track with a team tier)**: hosted registry, team permissions, protected refs + policies, review workflows + notifications, provenance/audit search ("every layer any agent wrote this month, grouped by model"), sidecar CDN, SLA

The merge engine being open is what makes the standard adoptable (11); coordination is the product.

## 10.3 Federation and grouping

Multi-model sessions (04 §4.2) render as one logical PR. Cross-org federation (architect's registry ↔ engineer's registry) via signed layer exchange: the long-game version is registries syncing like Git remotes, with the DBL/DPP world (manufacturer layers, §03) as external principals.

## 10.4 Ref policies (branch protection for buildings)

Per ref: required checks (IDS specs by digest), minimum reviewers, signature requirements, author-kind rules (e.g. agent-authored layers always need one human approval), risk-tier rules (red-tier ops never auto-merge), and **auto-merge**: conflict-free + all-green + in-policy layers merge unattended. Auto-merge is what makes the nightly model-gardener agent (06 §6.5) safe to ship.

## 10.5 Visibility

Public, internal, private registries (same trichotomy as code forges). A public registry of open reference models with full layer history is the community flywheel: teaching material (BFH courses run on it), benchmark corpus, and the place hackathon projects publish to.

## 10.6 Endgame

The registry as the system of record for *change* in the built environment: every model state reproducible, every contributor accountable, every agent auditable, across organizations and decades. The pitch to enterprises is insurance-grade: "show me who changed the fire rating of this wall, when, on whose instruction, and what checks passed" answered in one query.
