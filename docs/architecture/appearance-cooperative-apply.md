# Cooperative appearance Apply

The viewer's internal `commitAppearance` command returns a promise. Its controller must await completion, prevent a second Apply, and abort preparation when the draft or target changes. `onProgress` reports `preparing`, `validating`, and `publishing`; every callback runs before any IFC installation.

Entity operations are prepared through `StoreEditor.prepareEntityOperations`. The shared appearance validator also serves the standalone synchronous entity API. Prepared effects and mutation records supply owned history values, replacing the previous synchronous draft-only appearance helper. No draft view or publication graph escapes the mutations package.

The command retains its earlier source checkpoint and checks it again after asynchronous preparation. The final phase has no await: it installs the reversible IFC checkpoint, captures the after-dependency guard, prepares asset/history/GPU ownership, and publishes geometry with the single existing Undo entry. Any failure before that publication restores IFC and releases provisional resources. SDK edits, model replacement, cancellation and callback failures do not publish a partial command.

The appearance consumer uses a bounded cumulative allocation allowance of 2 GiB and 32 million work steps. This counts all private copies over the job; it is not a measured live-heap limit or an allocation reservation. The mutations API's smaller defaults remain unchanged. The actual public Convento regression exercises the first and second entire-model planar applications within this allowance; exceeding a bound reports failure and preserves the prior model. It does not fall back to blocking synchronous preparation.

When available, the browser's `scheduler.postTask` schedules fresh background tasks, allowing pending user interaction to run ahead of preparation. The fallback is a host timer. This replaces `scheduler.yield()` continuations: the paired browser acceptance found that frames continued while trusted input could remain queued until Apply completed. Neither path replaces exact synchronous comparison of escaped SDK values: source/dependency guards, final installation and history/GPU publication still perform synchronous work. This slice therefore requires actual interaction measurement and does not claim a universal frame-time bound or completion of the responsiveness issue.

Actual browser evidence is under `evidence/appearance/appearance-cooperative-apply-*`.
The fresh measurement reached successful whole-model Apply; a separate functional
journey completed keyboard Undo and Redo with the second federated wall untouched.
Redo restored the exact ordered mesh-buffer fingerprint from Apply. The recorded
initial/Undo aggregate hashes are order-dependent and are not a claim of canonical
byte identity across differently ordered streamed pieces. The screenshot shows
all authored pieces restored after Redo. The measurement confirms a remaining
visible final long task and rendering gaps during preparation; this is not a
completed smoothness fix.

Cancellation was also exercised in the actual browser: an observer clicked the
real enabled Discard DOM button when the preparation message rendered. Both
loaded models retained their pre-Apply buffer fingerprints, with no authored
entities or Undo entries published. A later protocol-driven click can arrive
after the final synchronous phase; cancellation cannot interrupt that phase or
undo an already completed command. The deterministic phase-triggered run proves
the live UI cancellation path, not arbitrary input latency during the final fence.

The follow-up [paired trusted-input acceptance](evidence/appearance/apply-responsiveness/README.md) compares the scheduling change with otherwise identical main sources and runtime. It covers viewport wheel input, real Discard input, retained model identity and sampled JavaScript memory. The final synchronous fence remains a visible limitation; preparation responsiveness is not a universal frame-time guarantee.
