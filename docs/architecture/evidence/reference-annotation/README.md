# Reference placement and textured annotation acceptance

The local browser acceptance run exercises the mounted Author → Appearance dock,
not a standalone component. A 512 × 512 asymmetric image is calibrated from two
visible landmarks to a 2 m span and placed as an independent reference. An
ordinary viewport pick selects its string reference identity without selecting
an IFC entity (`reference-pick.json`).

The library's **Save into model** creates `IfcAnnotation` owner 65 in the loaded
IFC model, with an explicit Name and spatial container. `created.json` records
the selected owner and its texture/UVs. Undo removes the annotation geometry and
clears its selection while retaining the independent reference (`undo.json`);
Redo restores the annotation and its captured image (`redo.json`).

Normal IFC + images export produces an IFCZIP containing the original image
asset. A fresh normal load renders the annotation textured
(`reopen-before-pick.png`). An ordinary viewport pick selects the reopened
`IfcAnnotation` owner 65 (`reopened-selected.png`, `reopened-verified.json`).
The digest-named image is
`f2be22cb22f33a21bd40eab8b3da5c2df4f537841687f58af746413a9c172203`.
The generated IFCZIP is intentionally not committed as a binary test fixture.

These artifacts cover this image/reference/annotation workflow. They do not
claim portable independent-reference image packaging, editing an existing
reference's calibration through the dock, shared-room reference synchronization,
or the later scan reconstruction stages.

The final run explicitly asserts Undo clears selection, then exports and freshly
reopens the resulting archive before the ordinary annotation pick.

An additional independent IfcOpenShell 0.8.2 check is recorded in
`independent-ifc-reader.json`. `verify-export.py` validates the actual exported
IFCZIP using full EXPRESS rules, its native geometry engine, independent IFC
placement/unit resolution, indexed UV-to-world-corner association, and archived
image digest. This artifact passed with zero schema errors and zero corner error.
The rotated/cropped PDF and fresh-room extension is documented in
[reference PDF acceptance](../reference-pdf/README.md).
