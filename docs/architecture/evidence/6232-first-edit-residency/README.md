# First authored mesh: actual resident scene evidence

A [fresh current-main native retest](current-main/README.md) records the integrated source, new runtime, automatic launch, single resident wall, Undo/Redo and completed export/reload separately. The capture below retains its original source and runtime attribution.

Captured on 1 October 2026 at source and actual full-root build `ce855180ba95a8419175474ab80225dd699ee715`, stacked on the [primary completion fix and proof](../6232-primary-load-completion/README.md) (`9c3781a18565b514c794bf480318d7e18d74b46a`), which depends on #6594. Main base was `9e2f15b9dd46403cc9b06bb882ee3f5c2b16f014`. A fresh owned Windows Chrome 154 profile used a nonfallback NVIDIA Blackwell adapter. The actually served WASM SHA-256 was `9646cc889c7a5148a2a97a6b90fa4349869840aea0065bd382b3a4e3bcfd3034`.

The UI sequence was **Start blank**, two plan clicks for a wall, Escape twice, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, File → Export IFC (with changes) → Export, then reload the completed native Windows download through a fresh page's canonical file input. Start blank automatically launched Wall on its own completed model; no additional Model/Wall clicks or injected store actions were used.

The [first wall](wall.png) now has **one resident flat part and twelve triangles**, matching the CPU model's one part and twelve triangles. The previous completion capture had two resident parts (twenty-four triangles) for the same single CPU mesh. Comparing those actual captures, the complete serialized CPU mesh snapshot is unchanged, including its positions, normals, indices, placement and style metadata. The fix changes consumption bookkeeping, not the actual IFC meshing output. It identifies each source slot separately: parts sharing an IFC item are retained.

- [Completed blank project with Wall automatically active](loaded-blank.png) and [empty plan](blank.png).
- [Wall](wall.png): one plan cut, one CPU mesh, one resident part, one Undo entry. The actual inspector shows approximately 3.191 m length, 0.20 m thickness and 3.00 m height.
- [Undo](undo.png): no CPU mesh or plan cut, zero Undo entries and one Redo entry. The [renderer GPU color readback](undo-renderer-color.png) is empty. The owner list enumerates current CPU owners, so it is not a separate query for the former wall's allocation.
- [Redo](redo.png): one resident part, one CPU mesh and one Undo entry. Complete CPU mesh snapshots and placed triangle corners match the first wall.
- [Reload](reload.png): one resident part in a fresh page, with triangle corners identical to Redo. Full-load metadata adds a geometry hash, so complete CPU metadata identity across reload is not claimed.

First Wall, Redo and reload have the same IFC Z-up bounds: X approximately `[-1.595744133, 1.595744133]`, Y `[-0.1000000015, 0.1000000015]`, Z `[0, 3]` metres. These derive from world-placed renderer triangle corners, converted from viewer Y-up. [Facts](facts.json.gz) preserve the native adapter, actual automatic-launch model IDs, producer frame, CPU mesh arrays, scene metadata, history depths and completed download events.

[The completed IFC download](Untitled_Project_export.ifc) contains 2,849 bytes, SHA-256 `17093c5499fb4f4317ef1c5b53714b8ff70add4dd1ea416692a2e7ca9be21569`. Chrome reported completion before those actual bytes were reloaded. Hardware GPU color readbacks succeeded at all six captured states; [Wall](wall-renderer-color.png), [Undo](undo-renderer-color.png) and [reload](reload-renderer-color.png) are committed. Flat-part metadata and triangle-corner data are not GPU upload-byte hashes. No rendering performance or timing claim is made.

Seven mounted cases use the real canonical IFC loader, real WASM author/remesh output, federation merger, edit drain, streaming reconciler, Scene and Camera. Four genuine baseline failures reproduce the duplicate in metres/millimetres at one/two models. Positive invariants preserve a triangle partition of the actual engine output under one item, a failed GPU allocation followed by retry, and two real wall meshes in a mixed append/replacement commit. Only GPU allocation and presentation are replaced in those mounted tests. The official production revert oracle observed seven passes with the fix, then two passes and five assertion failures when all three production paths were reverted, with restoration verified.

Qualification at ce855: root build 61 tasks, plain root typecheck 109 tasks and all 3,188 test files, root lint 7,975 files with no errors, API snapshot 9,149 exports unchanged, and MPL/test-wiring/module-size/source-text-assertion/changeset/bump-level gates passed. Twenty-nine focused cases passed with zero skips: seven residency, four existing drain, eleven completion and seven real-WASM blank-frame cases. An unintended regression shard was interrupted and excluded from qualification; the corrected drain shard passed. This layer addresses duplicate resident uploads; #6232 remains open for its remaining charter work.

The [lossless facts archive](facts.json.gz) preserves the exact original UTF-8 JSON (79,569 bytes), SHA-256 `61af624cc0fa4f699a22aed3027cffbf2fcbdb20199c2cd15e4b4cec7da12e37`. Decompress with `gzip -dc facts.json.gz > facts.json`; no fields, mesh arrays or evidence were removed. All source/runtime and observation limits above remain unchanged.
