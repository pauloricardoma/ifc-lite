# Captured GLB ingest evidence (#4380)

The offline `tools/texture-authoring/derive-boulder-glb.mjs` packages the public
[Poly Haven boulder_01](https://polyhaven.com/a/boulder_01) glTF/BIN/diffuse JPEG
as a GLB. Poly Haven assets are [CC0](https://polyhaven.com/license). The derivation **explicitly removes normal
and metallic/roughness maps**, producing an albedo-only fixture; the production
importer refuses those unsupported maps on the original full material.
Geometry, indexed UV seams, and diffuse JPEG bytes are unchanged.

An actual run through the built cache decoder retained 67,042 vertices,
66,122 triangles, 67,042 UV pairs, and the exact diffuse JPEG digest above.
The sampler defaults to repeat in both directions; it is not silently clamped
to satisfy a downstream authoring limitation. Measured U range is
[0.00126901979, 0.99843168259] and V range is
[0.00172561407, 0.99873685837], inside the native capture planner’s [0, 1] range.

Automated invariants include an asymmetric seam, texture transform, rotated
nonuniform node scale, inverse-transpose normals, mirrored winding, a 12,000-node
scene chain, and explicit rejection of unsupported appearance or image ranges.
This is ingest evidence; it does not establish IFC creation, portable export,
shared-room behavior, or scan reconstruction acceptance.
