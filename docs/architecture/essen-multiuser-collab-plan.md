# Multiuser Collaboration in the Essen Web Viewer — Implementation Plan

**Status:** Draft v0.1 (planning only — no feature code yet).
**Branch:** `claude/essen-multiuser-collab-plan-uiSiJ`.
**Owner:** Louis Trümpler (LT+).
**Scope:** Wire the existing `@ifc-lite/collab` + `@ifc-lite/collab-server`
packages into `apps/viewer` so multiple people can open the same model and
see each other, comment, and edit — with **link-based sharing (no accounts)**
and **full support for legacy STEP IFC**, not just IFCX.

This document is the source of truth for the viewer-side rollout. It is the
*consumer* counterpart to `docs/architecture/collab-plan.md`, which tracks the
`@ifc-lite/collab` package itself. Where that doc ends ("…remains a
viewer-package task"), this one begins.

**Status legend:** ☐ pending · ◐ in progress · ☑ done · ⚠ blocked.

## 0. TL;DR

- We are **not building a collaboration engine** — it already exists and is
  production-grade. We are building the *viewer integration* and a *thin
  share/identity layer*.
- **Sharing is link-based and accountless.** A "Share" button mints a signed,
  short-lived **room token** that carries the role (`viewer` / `commenter` /
  `editor`). Anyone with the link joins; identity is ephemeral (pick a
  name + auto color, like a Figma guest / Google Docs anonymous animal).
- **Legacy STEP `.ifc` is fully supported** by keying the CRDT on the IFC
  **GlobalId (GUID)** instead of an IFCX path, and by reusing the existing
  `bindMutationsToCollab` bridge. IFCX (IFC5) remains the long-term native
  format; STEP is adapted, not privileged.
- Rollout is staged so each milestone is independently shippable behind a
  `collab.enabled` flag: **M1 presence + comments → M2 property editing →
  M3 geometry editing → M4 hardening/scale.**

## 1. What already exists (inventory — reuse, don't rebuild)

A deliberate audit of the two packages. The takeaway: the hard parts are done.

### 1.1 `@ifc-lite/collab` (client runtime) — v0.2.1

| Capability | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Session façade | `packages/collab/src/session.ts` | `createCollabSession({ roomId, user, provider, serverUrl, token })`. Glues Y.Doc + providers + presence + undo + conflicts. |
| Providers | `providers/{websocket,indexeddb,webrtc}.ts` | `'indexeddb+websocket'` recommended for browser. Token forwarded as `?token=`. |
| Presence / awareness | `awareness/{presence,overlay,render,color}.ts` | Typed `PresenceState`, stable per-user color hash, 30 Hz cap, 10 s stale eviction, cursor reprojection per camera. |
| **Viewer bridge** | `viewer-bridge.ts` | `mountPresenceInViewer({ session, container, viewport, raycastToWorld })` — drop-in, already designed for our viewport DOM. |
| Mutations bridge | `mutations/bind.ts` | `bindMutationsToCollab(view, session, { resolveEntity })` — mirrors `@ifc-lite/mutations` property writes into the CRDT. **This is our legacy-IFC seam.** |
| IFCX seed/snapshot | `snapshot/{from-ifcx,to-ifcx,layers}.ts` | `seedFromIfcx(doc, buf)`, `snapshotToIfcx(doc)`, per-user layer extraction. |
| Conflict detection | `conflicts/{detector,ui-bridge}.ts` | Emits structured events (ghost overlay, keep-mine/keep-theirs) for the viewer to render. |
| Undo | `undo.ts` | Local-origin `Y.UndoManager` — isolates each user's undo stack. |
| Federation | `federation/*` | Multi-model rooms (1 project = N models), cross-model records. |
| Geometry CRDT | `geometry/*` | Content-addressed blob store, parametric params, CSG, GC. |

### 1.2 `@ifc-lite/collab-server` (reference sync server) — v0.2.0

| Capability | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `y-websocket`-compatible server | `src/server.ts`, `bin.ts` | `startCollabServer({ port, persistence, authenticate, … })`. |
| **Roles + auth hook** | `src/auth.ts` | `Role = 'viewer' \| 'commenter' \| 'editor' \| 'admin'`, pluggable `AuthenticateFn(token, roomId) → Principal`, `canWrite(principal)`. **Exactly the access-rights model the product wants.** |
| Server-side write enforcement | `src/room-manager.ts` | `applyUpdateOrDeny` drops mutations from non-writers; per-message verifier hook. |
| Path locks | `src/path-locks.ts` | Per-section server-side locks (type promotion, etc.). |
| Audit log | `src/audit-log.ts` | Every connect/update/awareness event, JSONL sink. |
| Rate limiting | `src/rate-limit.ts` | Per-principal budgets (tighter for service accounts/agents). |
| Anti-replay | `src/replay-protect.ts` | Per-update nonce verification. |
| Persistence | `src/persistence{,-redis,-s3}.ts` | File (dev), Redis, S3 (prod). Compaction every N updates. |
| Blob route | `src/blob-route.ts` | Geometry blob upload/download with size limits. |
| Server snapshots | `src/snapshot-worker.ts` | Periodic `.ifcx` export per room. |

**Conclusion:** the *only* genuinely new code is (a) a small **token-minting
service** for accountless share links, (b) the **viewer UI + store wiring**,
and (c) the **STEP-IFC → CRDT adapter**.

### 1.3 The gap in the viewer (`apps/viewer`)

- No dependency on `@ifc-lite/collab` yet. No presence, no rooms, no sharing.
- **No authentication or user identity** anywhere (only BYOK API keys for the
  AI chat). `apps/server` is a stateless Rust parser; there is no app backend.
- State is **Zustand** with ~20 slices (`apps/viewer/src/store/`). Editing
  already works via `@ifc-lite/mutations` (`store/slices/mutationSlice.ts`).
- Models are loaded locally (file picker / drop / `?model=<url>` /
  IndexedDB recent-files) and identified by a **transient UUID**
  (`FederatedModel.id`) — there is no stable, shareable document id today.
- BCF comments already exist (`BCFPanel.tsx`, `bcfSlice.ts`) but are
  offline/manual import-export, with a free-text `bcfAuthor` string.

## 2. Product shape

### 2.1 The Share button

Lives in `MainToolbar.tsx`, grouped with the Download/Export controls. Clicking
it opens a dialog (Radix `Dialog`, already used throughout):

```
┌─ Share "Office-Tower-ARCH.ifc" ───────────────────┐
│                                                    │
│  Anyone with the link can:                         │
│     ( ) View      — see model, cursors, comments   │
│     ( ) Comment   — + add BCF issues/markups       │
│     (•) Edit      — + change properties & geometry │
│                                                    │
│  https://essen.ifclite.dev/m/AB12CD?t=eyJhbGciOi…  │
│                                          [ Copy ]  │
│                                                    │
│  Live now:  ●Louis (you)  ●anonymous-otter         │
│  Link expires in 7 days · [Revoke all links]       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Three role choices map **directly** onto the server's `Role` enum
  (`viewer`/`commenter`/`editor`). `admin` is reserved for the room creator.
- The selected role is **baked into the token**, so a single dialog produces
  per-role links (or one link per role — see §3).
- "Live now" is just `session.presence` — free once presence is wired.

### 2.2 Identity — accountless, "modern"

No login, no email collection. On first join the user is assigned an
**ephemeral identity**:

- A friendly handle (`anonymous-otter`) editable inline, persisted in
  `localStorage` so the same browser keeps its name/color across sessions.
- A stable color via the existing `awareness/color.ts` hash.
- The room creator ("owner") is the browser that first opened/shared the
  model; ownership is held in a signed **owner token** in `localStorage`
  (and optionally re-mintable from the original file). No server-side user
  table.

This is the Figma-guest / Excalidraw model: zero friction, identity is a
display concern, and **authorization rides entirely in the room token**, not
in an account.

> **Upgrade path (out of scope for M1–M4, noted for completeness):** if named
> accounts are ever wanted, the `AuthenticateFn` already accepts any token —
> swap the link-token verifier for an OIDC/JWT verifier and add an invite-by-
> email UI. Nothing in M1–M4 blocks this.

---

## 3. Access model — link tokens (no accounts)

This is the only new *backend* concept. We need a tiny stateless endpoint (or
edge function) that signs and verifies room tokens. It can live in `apps/api`
(already exists for the chat proxy) or as a route on the collab-server itself.

### 3.1 Token

A short JWT (HS256, server-held secret), forwarded by the client as
`?token=` and validated by the collab-server's `AuthenticateFn`:

```jsonc
{
  "room": "m/AB12CD",        // room id (see §4.1)
  "role": "editor",          // viewer | commenter | editor (never admin via link)
  "kid": "v1",               // key id for rotation
  "jti": "…",                // unique id → enables revocation
  "iat": 1730000000,
  "exp": 1730604800          // default 7d, configurable in the Share dialog
}
```

- **Minting** (`POST /collab/token`): owner presents the **owner token** for a
  room + desired role + TTL → server returns a signed room token. Only the
  owner can mint.
- **Verifying** (`AuthenticateFn` in collab-server): decode, check signature +
  `exp`, check `jti` not in a revocation set, return
  `{ userId: <ephemeral id>, role }`. Re-validated every 5 min per spec (the
  server already does periodic re-auth).
- **Revocation**: "Revoke all links" rotates the room's `kid`; a tiny
  deny-list (`jti`) covers single-link revoke. Stored wherever the
  collab-server persistence lives (Redis/S3) — no user DB.

### 3.2 Why this satisfies "access rights like view / comment / edit"

The enforcement already exists server-side:

- `viewer` → read-only; `canWrite` returns false → mutations dropped by
  `applyUpdateOrDeny`. Presence still flows.
- `commenter` → may write **only** to the comment/BCF sub-tree; enforced with
  a `verifyMessage` hook + a `path-locks` rule scoping writes to the
  `comments` map (see §6).
- `editor` → full `canWrite`.

So the role chosen in the Share dialog is **enforced on the server**, not just
hidden in the UI — the important property for real access control.

---

## 4. Legacy STEP IFC adaptation (the hard part)

The CRDT data model (`packages/collab/src/doc/schema.ts`) is **IFCX-shaped**:
three top-level `Y.Map`s (`entities`, `relationships`, `geometry`) keyed by
**path strings**. IFCX files seed straight in via `seedFromIfcx`. STEP `.ifc`
files do **not** have IFCX paths — they have integer express IDs (`#123`) that
are *file-local and unstable across re-exports*. We need a stable key.

### 4.1 Stable identity: GUID-as-path

Every meaningful STEP entity (`IfcRoot` subtypes — walls, spaces, storeys,
rels) carries an **`IfcGloballyUniqueId` (GUID)** — a stable, file-independent
22-char identifier. The parser already extracts it (`@ifc-lite/parser` GUID
handling). We use the GUID as the CRDT key:

```
STEP express id  #145  ──┐
                         ├──►  GUID  "3vB2… Qd"  ──►  CRDT path  "/3vB2…Qd"
parser IfcDataStore  ────┘                            (key in entities Y.Map)
```

- **Room id** = `m/<short-hash>` where the hash is derived from the model's
  content/GUID-set (stable for the same model regardless of who uploads it),
  so two people who open the same file land in the same room.
- Entities **without** a GUID (geometry primitives, placements, profiles) are
  *not* first-class CRDT entities; they live inside their owner entity's
  geometry record (already how `GeometryRef` works) and are addressed by a
  deterministic sub-key. This matches the IFCX model where only "objects" are
  path-addressable.

### 4.2 Seeding a STEP model into the Y.Doc

Two options; we plan **both**, sequenced:

1. **M2 (properties): seed lazily via the mutation bridge.** Do *not* convert
   the whole model. The model is loaded locally by every peer (they already
   have the bytes — same file behind the share link). The Y.Doc starts
   *empty* and accumulates only the **edit layer**: properties/relationships
   that someone actually changes, keyed by GUID. This is exactly what
   `extractUserLayer` / `to-ifcx` layering is built for, and it keeps the CRDT
   tiny (kilobytes, not the whole model). `resolveEntity(expressId)` →
   `guidPath` is the only new mapping (a `Map<number,string>` built once from
   the parsed store).

2. **M2.5 (full seed / authoritative room): STEP → CRDT seeder.** For "upload
   once, anyone joins without the file", add
   `seedFromStep(doc, ifcDataStore)` in `packages/collab` that walks the
   parsed `IfcDataStore` and emits `createEntity`/`setAttribute`/
   `createRelationship` calls keyed by GUID. This is the new
   `from-step.ts` counterpart to `from-ifcx.ts`. Snapshotting back out reuses
   `to-ifcx.ts` (CRDT → IFCX); a **CRDT → STEP** writer is a later concern
   (export already round-trips changes via `ExportChangesButton`).

> **Design call:** M1–M2 use approach (1) — **edit-layer only**, model bytes
> shared out-of-band via the link target. This is the lowest-risk way to get
> "full legacy IFC support" without a whole STEP→IFCX conversion landing
> first. Approach (2) is the upgrade for true serverless join.

### 4.3 Mutation flow (legacy STEP, M2)

```
User edits a property in PropertyEditor.tsx
        │
        ▼
mutationSlice → StoreEditor (@ifc-lite/mutations)   ← local model updates (unchanged)
        │
        ▼  (only when a collab session is bound)
bindMutationsToCollab.setProperty(expressId, pset, prop, value)
        │  resolveEntity(expressId) → "/<GUID>"
        ▼
session.transact(() => setPropertyValue(doc, guidPath, …))   ← CRDT write
        │
        ▼  y-websocket → collab-server (role check) → all peers
Remote peers' Y.Doc updates → observer → apply back into their StoreEditor
```

The **return path** (remote CRDT change → local model) is the one new piece of
glue: a Y.Doc observer that maps `guidPath → expressId` (inverse map) and
replays the change through `mutationSlice` *without* re-broadcasting (guard by
transaction origin — the session already tags origins).

### 4.4 Geometry for STEP (M3)

- Property/relationship edits (M2) cover ~80% of real collaborative BIM
  workflows and need no geometry sync.
- For geometry edits (move/rotate/add element — the viewer supports these via
  placement-edit chains), reuse the `geometry/blob-store.ts` +
  `GeometryRef { params }` model. Placement transforms are small param maps →
  trivially CRDT-able. Mesh replacement uses the content-addressed blob store +
  conflict surface (both peers keep their blob; badge shown).
- Determinism caveat (open problem in `collab-plan.md`): the Rust geometry
  kernel must produce bit-identical meshes for identical params or we fall back
  to blob sync. Tracked there, not re-litigated here.

### 4.5 IFCX models

Strictly easier: `seedFromIfcx` already does the full round-trip end-to-end
(it's tested against the buildingSMART hello-wall fixture). When the loaded
model is `.ifcx`, skip the GUID mapping and seed directly. The viewer simply
branches on file type at session-creation time.

### 4.6 How the recipient gets the model (share-link transport)

A share link has **two jobs**: deliver the model **bytes** and join the collab
**room**. The CRDT only carries the live *edit layer* (§4.2 approach 1), so —
unless we seed the whole model into the Y.Doc — the recipient still needs the
base model from somewhere. This is the one piece neither package provides today.

**Reuse the embed viewer's URL pattern, not the embed app.** The embed viewer
(`apps/viewer-embed`) already loads a model from `?modelUrl=https://…`
(`bridge/urlParams.ts`, `EmbedViewer.tsx`) — the recipient's browser
`fetch()`es the bytes and parses locally. The main viewer has the same hook via
`?model=<url>` (`ViewerLayout.tsx:61`). But that URL must be **publicly
fetchable** (http/https only — `data:`/`blob:` rejected), so it assumes the
model is *already hosted*. The embed app itself is chrome-less (no toolbar /
panels / Share button), so collab lives in the **full viewer**; we reuse the
`?modelUrl` *mechanism*, and the embed app can later become a read-only
`viewer`-role presentation of a room.

Three transports, shipped in order:

| # | Transport | Share link | New infra | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Public URL** (embed today) | `?model=<url>&room=…&t=…` | none | model already on a CDN/server |
| 2 | **Upload-on-share** | `?model=<blobUrl>&room=…&t=…` | reuse `collab-server/blob-route.ts` | **M1 default** — share a local file |
| 3 | **Seed-into-room** | `?room=…&t=…` (no model url) | M2.5 `seedFromStep` | "just send a link", offline-capable |

- **(2) Upload-on-share is the missing piece, and it's small.** The
  collab-server **already ships a content-addressed blob route**
  (`packages/collab-server/src/blob-route.ts`, with size limits). On Share, PUT
  the model to it (or an S3 presigned URL), get a content-hashed URL back, and
  bake it into the link. Content addressing **pins an immutable base version** —
  essential, because every peer must seed its edit-layer from the *exact same*
  bytes or GUID-keyed edits won't line up. The room id (§4.1) is derived from
  that same content hash, so "same file → same room" falls out for free.
- **(3) Seed-into-room is the truest "send a link" UX.** The owner seeds the
  full model into the Y.Doc (M2.5 `seedFromStep`); the recipient hydrates the
  model **through the CRDT sync itself** — no separate fetch, and IndexedDB
  makes it offline-capable. Cost: a larger Y.Doc (whole model, not just edits)
  and the STEP→CRDT seeder must land first.

**Recommendation:** M1 ships transport (2) — upload-on-share to the existing
blob route — as the default, falling back to (1) when the model is already at a
public URL. (3) becomes the default once `seedFromStep` lands at M2.5.

```

- **Transport:** `'indexeddb+websocket'` provider. IndexedDB gives instant
  reopen + offline edits that converge on reconnect; websocket gives realtime.
- **Hosting:** collab-server is a single Node process (`pnpm collab:server`
  already runs it). For prod: container + Redis (presence/locks) + S3
  (persistence/snapshots). Document in `docs/guide/`.

## 6. Comments / BCF as the `commenter` tier

To make `commenter` meaningful (write comments but not the model), we put
comments **in the CRDT** rather than offline BCF:

- Add a `comments` top-level `Y.Map` (or a reserved `/comments/*` path subtree)
  carrying BCF-shaped topics/comments/viewpoints, keyed by topic GUID.
- The existing `bcfSlice.ts` / `BCFPanel.tsx` UI binds to it; `bcfAuthor`
  becomes the ephemeral presence identity.
- Server enforcement: a `verifyMessage`/`path-locks` rule that lets
  `commenter` principals write **only** under `comments/*` and reject anything
  else. `viewer` can write nothing; `editor`/`admin` write everything.
- Comments still export to a real BCF `.zip` via `@ifc-lite/bcf` (unchanged) —
  now collaboratively authored.

This gives the three-tier access model real semantic teeth and reuses the BCF
investment.

## 7. Viewer integration tasks (file-level)

### 7.1 New store slice — `collabSlice`

`apps/viewer/src/store/slices/collabSlice.ts`:

- ☐ `session: CollabSession | null`, `status`, `role`, `peers` (from presence),
  `localIdentity { name, color }`, `roomId`.
- ☐ `startCollab(model, { roomId, token, role })` → `createCollabSession`,
  build GUID↔expressId maps, bind mutations, mount presence overlay,
  attach remote→local observer.
- ☐ `stopCollab()` → `session.dispose()`, teardown overlay/observer.
- ☐ Selectors: `isShared`, `canEdit` (role gate for UI affordances), `peers`.

### 7.2 Identity slice (ephemeral)

- ☐ `localStorage`-backed `{ handle, color }`; generate friendly name + color
  (reuse `awareness/color.ts`). Editable inline in the Share dialog.

### 7.3 Share UI

- ☐ `ShareDialog.tsx` — role radio, link with token, copy, "live now" presence
  list, expiry + revoke. Calls the token service.
- ☐ Share button in `MainToolbar.tsx` (and `MobileToolbar.tsx`), beside Export.
- ☐ Wire `?room=`/`?t=` deep-link handling in `ViewerLayout.tsx` (next to the
  existing `?model=` autoload) → auto-join on open.

### 7.4 Presence rendering

- ☐ Call `mountPresenceInViewer({ session, container, viewport, raycastToWorld })`
  from `Viewport.tsx`/`ViewportContainer.tsx`. Supply `raycastToWorld` from the
  renderer's existing picking so cursors anchor in 3D.
- ☐ Avatar stack in the toolbar/StatusBar; selection halos from peers'
  `presence.selection`.
- ☐ Settings toggle (existing settings panel) to hide others' cursors.

### 7.5 Mutation binding + remote apply

- ☐ `bindMutationsToCollab(view, session, { resolveEntity: guidFor })` in the
  edit path.
- ☐ Remote-change observer → replay into `mutationSlice` guarded by origin so
  it doesn't echo or pollute the local undo stack (use the session's
  per-origin undo).

### 7.6 Conflict UX

- ☐ Subscribe to `session.conflicts` / `conflicts/ui-bridge` → render the
  ghost/keep-mine/keep-theirs badge (new small component) + a "deleted while
  you edited — restore?" toast.

### 7.7 Token service

- ☐ `apps/api` route (or collab-server route) `POST /collab/token` +
  `verifyRoomToken` `AuthenticateFn`. Secret + key rotation via env.
- ☐ Revocation deny-list in the chosen persistence backend.

### 7.9 Model transport for recipients (§4.6)

- ☐ Upload-on-share: PUT the active model to the collab-server blob route
  (`blob-route.ts`) on Share → content-hashed URL; derive room id from the
  same hash.
- ☐ Bake `?model=<blobUrl>&room=…&t=…` into the link; reuse the existing
  `?model=` autoload (`ViewerLayout.tsx`) so the recipient fetches + parses
  the base model, then joins the room for the live layer.
- ☐ Fallback to transport (1) when the model is already at a public URL
  (skip upload).

### 7.8 Packaging

- ☐ Add `@ifc-lite/collab` to `apps/viewer/package.json`.
- ☐ Feature flag `collab.enabled` (env / settings) so it ships dark.
- ☐ Changeset (touches published `@ifc-lite/collab` if any export is added).

---

## 8. Milestones

Each milestone is shippable behind `collab.enabled` and has a hard exit gate.

### M1 — Presence + comments MVP · ~1.5–2 wk
**Goal:** Owner clicks Share → sends a link → recipient opens it, the model
loads for them, and they see each other's cursors, selections, and avatars;
comments sync live.
- Model transport: **upload-on-share** to the collab-server blob route (§4.6
  transport 2), `?model=<blobUrl>&room=…&t=…` link, recipient autoload via the
  existing `?model=` hook (transport 1 fallback when already public).
- collabSlice (presence only), ephemeral identity, Share dialog (link mint),
  deep-link join, `mountPresenceInViewer`, avatar stack, comment subtree +
  BCF binding, token service (viewer/commenter/editor minting; only
  commenter+ write comments).
- **Exit:** a recipient with only the link loads the model and joins; live
  cursors + selection halos + shared comments across two browsers; `viewer`
  role provably cannot write (server drops it); links expire/revoke.

### M2 — Property editing over legacy STEP · ~2 wk
**Goal:** `editor`s change properties and everyone converges.
- GUID↔expressId maps, `bindMutationsToCollab`, remote→local observer,
  per-user undo isolation, edit-layer-only Y.Doc, conflict badge for
  concurrent property writes.
- **Exit:** two editors change Pset values on the same wall; LWW resolves;
  loser notified; export reflects merged state; `commenter` blocked from
  property writes server-side.

### M2.5 — STEP → CRDT seeder (serverless join) · ~1 wk
**Goal:** Join a room without already having the file.
- `seedFromStep(doc, store)` in `packages/collab`; owner seeds on share;
  guests hydrate from the Y.Doc; periodic `.ifcx` server snapshot.
- **Exit:** guest with only the link reconstructs the model + edits.

### M3 — Geometry editing · ~2–3 wk
**Goal:** Collaborative move/rotate/add-element.
- Placement params as CRDT, mesh blob store + conflict surface, determinism
  validation/fallback, ghost overlay for concurrent moves.
- **Exit:** two peers move/add elements; deterministic params converge; mesh
  conflicts surface a badge, never corrupt.

### M4 — Production hardening · ~1–2 wk
**Goal:** Run it for real.
- Redis + S3 persistence, key rotation, audit dashboards, rate limits tuned,
  reconnect/offline-edit convergence tests, 24 h soak with 5 peers, deploy
  guide in `docs/guide/`.
- **Exit:** soak passes with no leaks; offline edits converge; access controls
  audited.

## 9. Security & privacy

- **Authorization on the server, not the client.** UI role gating is UX;
  `applyUpdateOrDeny` + `path-locks` are the real control. A `viewer` token
  cannot be hand-edited into write access (signed JWT, server-enforced role).
- **Link == capability.** Anyone with the link has that role — same trust model
  as Google Docs "anyone with the link". Default TTL 7 days; owner can revoke
  (rotate `kid`) and set shorter expiry. Communicate this clearly in the
  Share dialog.
- **No PII collected** (accountless) — ephemeral handles only. Audit log keys
  on the token `jti`/ephemeral id, not real identity.
- **Transport:** WSS/TLS (server already ships a TLS baseline);
  optional at-rest encryption for stored Y-state/blobs is tracked in
  `collab-plan.md` §5.6.
- **Abuse:** per-token rate limits (already in the server); room caps;
  blob size limits (already in `blob-route.ts`).

## 10. Open questions / decisions to confirm

1. **Token service home** — `apps/api` (exists, but is the AI-chat proxy) vs a
   route on collab-server vs an edge function. *Recommendation:* a route on the
   collab-server (it already holds the persistence backend for revocation).
2. **Room-id derivation for STEP** — content hash of the GUID-set vs a random
   id minted by the owner. Content hash = "same file → same room" magic but
   can collide across revisions; random id = explicit "create a shared session".
   *Recommendation:* owner-minted random id (explicit share intent), store the
   model→room mapping in the owner's `localStorage`.
3. **Edit-layer-only vs full seed for M1/M2** — confirmed edit-layer first
   (§4.2 approach 1); revisit at M2.5.
4. **CRDT → STEP writer** — needed for "download merged result as .ifc" vs
   "download as .ifcx". The existing `ExportChangesButton` change-set path may
   suffice; confirm whether a true STEP writer is in scope or IFCX export is
   acceptable for collaborative results.
5. **Mobile** — presence/comments on `MobileToolbar` in M1; editing on mobile
   deferred.
6. **Model bytes hosting (§4.6)** — upload-on-share to the collab-server blob
   route vs an S3 presigned PUT vs requiring an already-public `?model=` URL.
   *Recommendation:* blob route for M1 (no extra infra, content-addressed,
   co-located with revocation/persistence), graduating to seed-into-room at
   M2.5. Privacy note: a blob URL is itself a bearer capability — gate the
   blob route behind the same room token so the model isn't world-readable.

## 11. Relationship to `collab-plan.md`

That document tracks the *package* roadmap (v0.1→v1.0). Most of what this plan
consumes is already ☑/◐ there:

- Presence/awareness (v0.2 §2.3) — landed; viewer rendering (§2.4) is *this*
  doc's M1.
- Authorization/roles (v0.5 §5.1) — landed server-side; link-token minting is
  *this* doc's new bit.
- Geometry CRDT (v0.3) — foundations landed; viewer conflict badge (§3.5) is
  *this* doc's M3.
- Federation (v0.4) — landed; multi-model shared rooms are a post-M4 follow-up.

This plan adds **no new package roadmap items** except: `from-step.ts` seeder
(M2.5) and the link-token `AuthenticateFn` (M1), both small and additive.
