# Development Setup

Guide to setting up a development environment for IFClite.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | 22.x | JavaScript runtime (`engines` in `package.json`) |
| pnpm | 10.x (8.0+ minimum) | Package manager (pinned via `packageManager: pnpm@10.8.1`) |
| Rust | pinned nightly | WASM compilation; `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the nightly channel and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, and rustup installs both automatically on first use in the repo |
| wasm-pack | 0.12+ | WASM toolchain (only needed to rebuild WASM; see `pnpm build:wasm:fetch` below) |

### Installing Prerequisites

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    # Install Node.js via Homebrew
    brew install node@22

    # Install pnpm
    npm install -g pnpm

    # Install Rust (rustup reads rust-toolchain.toml and installs the
    # pinned nightly plus the wasm32-unknown-unknown target automatically)
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

    # Install wasm-pack
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    # Install Node.js (Ubuntu/Debian)
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

    # Install pnpm
    npm install -g pnpm

    # Install Rust (rustup reads rust-toolchain.toml and installs the
    # pinned nightly plus the wasm32-unknown-unknown target automatically)
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    source ~/.cargo/env

    # Install wasm-pack
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    # Install Node.js via winget
    winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

    # Install pnpm
    npm install -g pnpm

    # Install Rust via rustup-init.exe (download from https://rustup.rs).
    # rustup reads rust-toolchain.toml and installs the pinned nightly
    # plus the wasm32-unknown-unknown target automatically.

    # Install wasm-pack
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```

If you do not want a Rust toolchain at all, `pnpm build:wasm:fetch` downloads
the prebuilt `@ifc-lite/wasm` bundle from npm instead of compiling it.

## Clone and Build

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite.git
cd ifc-lite
```

The repository does not use Git LFS. Test model files (IFC/IFCX fixtures) are
not stored in git at all; they are fetched from a GitHub Release in the next
steps. A fresh clone installs no Git LFS hooks, so there is nothing to do here
even if you have Git LFS on your machine. (If a later push fails with
`You need Push access to upload Git LFS objects`, see
[Push fails with "You need Push access to upload Git LFS objects"](#push-fails-with-you-need-push-access-to-upload-git-lfs-objects).)

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Fetch Test Fixtures

```bash
pnpm fixtures
```

This downloads the IFC/IFCX test models catalogued in
`tests/models/manifest.json` from a GitHub Release. The fetch is selective and
idempotent: files already on disk with a matching SHA-256 are skipped, and
every download is hash-verified. Tests skip cleanly when fixtures are absent,
so this step is optional for a first build. See `tests/models/README.md` for
details.

### 4. Build All Packages

```bash
pnpm build
```

### 5. Verify Build

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Start viewer (builds packages, then runs the viewer dev server)
pnpm dev
```

```

## Development Workflow

### Watch Mode

Run a specific package in watch mode:

```bash
# Watch parser
cd packages/parser && pnpm dev

# Watch renderer
cd packages/renderer && pnpm dev
```

### Running the Viewer

From the repo root (builds workspace packages first):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Or, if packages are already built:

```bash
cd apps/viewer
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Building WASM

```bash
pnpm build:wasm
```

The output goes to `packages/wasm/pkg/`. This needs the pinned nightly
toolchain and `wasm-pack`. Without a Rust toolchain, use
`pnpm build:wasm:fetch` to download the prebuilt bundle from npm.

### Running Rust Tests

The Cargo workspace root is the repo root:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### Generating Documentation

**Rust Documentation (rustdoc):**

```bash
# Generate and open in browser (from the repo root)
cargo doc --no-deps --open

# Generate for a specific crate
cargo doc -p ifc-lite-core --open

# Generate without opening
cargo doc --no-deps
# Output: target/doc/index.html
```

**MkDocs (Project Documentation):**

```bash
# One-off: install MkDocs and plugins
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt

# Serve the docs site
pnpm docs:serve
# Opens at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## IDE Setup

### VS Code

Install recommended extensions:

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "rust-lang.rust-analyzer",
    "tamasfe.even-better-toml",
    "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
  ]
}
```

### Settings

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "[rust]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "rust-lang.rust-analyzer"
  },
  "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": "all"
}
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a Dependency

TypeScript packages:

```bash
cd packages/parser
pnpm add new-package
```

Rust crates:

```bash
cd rust/core
cargo add new-crate
```

### Creating a New Package

```bash
mkdir packages/new-package
cd packages/new-package

# Initialize
pnpm init

# Add to workspace (update root package.json if needed)
```

### Updating Dependencies

```bash
# TypeScript
pnpm update -r

# Rust
cargo update
```

## Troubleshooting

### WASM Build Fails

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
pnpm build:wasm
```

### Node Modules Issues

```bash
# Clean install (keep pnpm-lock.yaml; it is the source of truth)
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
```

### TypeScript Errors

```bash
# Rebuild type declarations
pnpm -r build
```

### Push fails with "You need Push access to upload Git LFS objects"

Verbatim output from a real push of a text-only commit to a contributor's fork.
The push dies while Git LFS is uploading objects, before any ref reaches the
remote.

```
batch response: You need Push access to upload Git LFS objects.
Uploading LFS objects:   0% (0/80), 0 B | 0 B/s, done.
error: failed to push some refs
```

The 80 is not your commit: it is the number of Git LFS pointer blobs this
repository's history still holds, as counted over the refs of a plain clone.
`git lfs ls-files --all` in a fresh clone prints the same 80 files. Your own
clone may report more, because `--all` walks every ref it has and a long-lived
clone also has remote-tracking refs for forks. None of those objects are at
HEAD: no `.gitattributes` in this repo declares `filter=lfs` any more.

Three fixes, least invasive first. Fixes 2 and 3 both touch a hooks directory
that may not be the one you think, so read
[Check which hooks directory you are about to change](#check-which-hooks-directory-you-are-about-to-change)
before picking either.

```bash
# 1. Change nothing on disk, get this one push out.
#    Skips EVERY pre-push hook, not just the Git LFS one.
git push --no-verify <remote> <branch>

# 2. Narrowest lasting fix: this hook only, no config touched.
#    Read it first (see below) and delete only if it is git-lfs's.
rm "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-path hooks)/pre-push"

# 3. Whole-clone fix: removes the hooks and this clone's lfs filters.
git lfs uninstall --local
```

Two cautions on the first two.

`--no-verify` skips **all** pre-push hooks. If your clone runs anything else at
push time, run those checks yourself before leaning on it.

Before running the `rm`, read the file. A hook git-lfs wrote is a shebang, an
optional "is git-lfs installed" guard, and `git lfs pre-push "$@"`, and dropping
it costs nothing here because this repo has no LFS content. If yours also runs
your own commands, delete only the git-lfs lines and keep the rest.

`--local` is clone-scoped in its **config** effect. Per
`git lfs uninstall --help` it removes the lfs smudge and clean filters from
this repository's git config instead of the global `~/.gitconfig`, so Git LFS
keeps working in your other repositories. `git lfs install --local` puts this
clone's LFS setup back if you ever need it.

#### Check which hooks directory you are about to change

`git lfs uninstall` also deletes git-lfs's hook files, and `--local` does not
scope that part. The hooks it deletes are the ones in whatever `core.hooksPath`
resolves to, which is not always the `.git/hooks` of the checkout you are
standing in:

- every **linked worktree** of a clone resolves to the main clone's
  `.git/hooks`, with nobody having configured anything;
- `core.hooksPath` can be set, locally or globally, to an absolute path in a
  **different repository**, and then that repository's hooks are the ones on
  the chopping block.

Measured with git-lfs 3.7.1 and git 2.50.1: `git lfs uninstall --local` run
inside a repo whose `core.hooksPath` pointed at another repository's
`.git/hooks` deleted that other repository's `pre-push`, `post-checkout`,
`post-commit` and `post-merge`. An unrelated `pre-commit` in the same directory
survived, so it removes git-lfs's own hooks rather than everything, but the
repository that owned them is now without a `pre-push`, and per
`git lfs pre-push --help` that hook is what uploads a commit's LFS objects.
Pushes from that repository silently stop uploading them.

It only deletes a hook whose body it recognises as one it wrote: given a
hand-edited body it prints `Hook already exists: <name>` and leaves the file.
That is a narrower blast radius than the paragraph above might suggest, but it
is not a safety net, because the hooks git-lfs installed are exactly the ones
it recognises.

This directory-resolution surprise is not hypothetical here. An earlier,
automated version of `pnpm check:git-lfs` could delete the hooks itself; run
from a throwaway directory, it resolved through `core.hooksPath` and deleted
the real clone's hooks. That is why the check is detection-only now and prints
commands for you to run instead. The same resolution applies to the commands.

So before running fix 2 or fix 3, print the directory and satisfy yourself that
no other checkout shares it:

```bash
git config --get core.hooksPath                         # empty means unset
git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-path hooks   # what will be changed
```

If it is shared, fix 1 is the one that touches nothing. Reach for fix 2 only
once you know the checkout that owns that directory does not need its
`pre-push`.

`pnpm check:git-lfs` reports whether your clone has the leftover hooks and
never writes anything. Two things about it are worth knowing before you read
its output: it inspects the repository the script file lives in, not your
current directory, and the hooks directory it names is that same
`core.hooksPath` resolution, so it names the directory for you and warns when
`core.hooksPath` is set. It only stays quiet about the hooks when a
`filter=lfs` rule actually applies to a path in your checkout, which it asks
`git check-attr`; a stale rule matching nothing does not buy silence. Run it
again after the fix; if a hook is still listed, read that file and delete it
yourself.

Who hits this: clones made before this repo retired Git LFS, and clones where
someone ran `git lfs install`. A clone made today is unaffected; cloning this
repository now leaves `.git/hooks` with nothing but git's own `.sample` files.

What is happening: `git lfs install` leaves a `pre-push` hook in `.git/hooks`,
and hooks are not version-controlled, so retiring LFS on a branch cannot remove
a hook that already exists in your clone. The hook asks git which objects are
about to be pushed with `git rev-list --objects <sha> --not --remotes=<remote>`.
When your clone has no remote-tracking refs for that remote, which is the normal
state right after `git remote add fork ...`, the `--not` side excludes nothing,
so the range widens to the entire history, which still contains LFS pointer
blobs from before the migration. git-lfs queues every one of them for upload,
and the push fails while it is uploading them, even though the commits you are
pushing contain only `.ts`/`.md` files. Fetch from that remote once, so the
clone has remote-tracking refs, and the same push queues nothing: the same
mechanism seen from the other side.

Why the LFS server refuses the upload is not something we have reproduced, so
this page does not guess at it. The fix does not depend on the answer: stop the
hook from offering the objects and the push goes through.
