# Python API Reference

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: python-api -->
Native [ifc-lite](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite) geometry tessellation for
Python. It turns an IFC file into per-entity triangle meshes with no Node, no
WASM, and no subprocess: the Rust geometry kernel runs directly inside the
Python process.

Meshes come back **welded**, **IFC Z-up**, in **absolute world metres**, keyed by
IFC STEP id (occurrences only). This is the analysis-ready export, distinct from
the render-oriented GLB the viewer uses.

## Install

```bash
pip install ifclite-geom
```

Prebuilt wheels ship for CPython 3.9+ on Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Apple
silicon and Intel), and Windows (x64). No Rust toolchain needed.

## Quick start

The module is `ifclite_geom`; its analysis functions take the raw IFC file as
`bytes`. `geometry_data_buffers` and `geometry_data_json` return the
same geometry and differ only in output format; pass
`include_directrices=True` to include analytic swept-disk paths. `entity_data`
reads attributes and property sets instead, without tessellating.
`check_swept_disks` checks authored swept-disk paths without tessellating, and
`swept_disk_definitions` returns reusable raw source paths and occurrence transforms.
`extrusion_definitions` returns exact source profiles and placed extrusion occurrences.
`authored_quantity_analysis` reads IFC-authored quantity observations, while
`quantity_analysis` joins them with nominal analytic source estimates.
`rebar_schedule` combines authored bar metadata with derived source geometry.

```python
import ifclite_geom
import numpy as np

with open("model.ifc", "rb") as f:
    ifc_bytes = f.read()

data = ifclite_geom.geometry_data_buffers(ifc_bytes)

print(data["element_count"], "elements")
print("up axis:", data["up_axis"], "| units:", data["units"])
print("rtc offset:", data["rtc_offset"])

for step_id, el in data["elements"].items():
    verts = np.frombuffer(el["vertices"], dtype=np.float64).reshape(-1, 3)
    faces = np.frombuffer(el["faces"],    dtype=np.uint32 ).reshape(-1, 3)
    print(step_id, el["ifc_type"], el["global_id"], verts.shape, faces.shape)
```

Prefer no numpy dependency? Use the JSON variant, which returns the same data as
arrays of numbers:

```python
import ifclite_geom, json

doc = json.loads(ifclite_geom.geometry_data_json(ifc_bytes))
first = next(iter(doc["elements"].values()))
print(first["ifc_type"], first["vertices"][0])  # [x, y, z] in metres
```

## API

### `geometry_data_buffers(ifc_bytes: bytes, quality: str | None = None, ids: set[int] | None = None, *, include_directrices: bool = False) -> dict`

The fast path. Vertices and faces come back as raw little-endian byte buffers so
you can hand them straight to `numpy.frombuffer` with zero parsing.

```text
{
  "up_axis": "Z",            # always Z (IFC native)
  "units": "m",              # always metres
  "rtc_offset": [x, y, z],   # geo-reference offset already folded into vertices
  "element_count": 1234,
  "elements": {
    <step_id:int>: {
      "ifc_type":  "IfcWall",
      "global_id": "3vB2...",   # may be None
      "name":      "Basic Wall:...",  # may be None
      "color":     [r, g, b, a],      # 0..1
      "vertices":  <bytes>,           # f64 little-endian, xyz triplets
      "faces":     <bytes>,           # u32 little-endian, triangle indices
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

Decode the buffers with:

```python
verts = np.frombuffer(el["vertices"], dtype=np.float64).reshape(-1, 3)  # (V, 3)
faces = np.frombuffer(el["faces"],    dtype=np.uint32 ).reshape(-1, 3)  # (F, 3)
```

### `geometry_data_json(ifc_bytes: bytes, quality: str | None = None, ids: set[int] | None = None, *, include_directrices: bool = False) -> str`

The same geometry as a readable `ifc-lite-geometry-data` JSON document (a
string; call `json.loads` on it). Vertices are `[x, y, z]` arrays and faces are
`[a, b, c]` index arrays, so no numpy is required. Each element also carries
`global_id` and `name` when the source entity has them.

### Analytic swept-disk paths

Pass `include_directrices=True` to either geometry function. The result adds
`swept_disks`, keyed by occurrence STEP id, and `directrix_diagnostics`. Each
occurrence can have multiple source `IfcSweptDiskSolid` items. A description
preserves `solid_id`, `directrix_id`, `Radius`, `InnerRadius`, `mapping_path`,
`source_modified`, `status`, an ordered `Directrix` of typed line and
circular-arc segments, `directrix_metrics`, and `nominal_quantities`. Coordinates are in absolute IFC
Z-up world metres, matching mesh vertices.
For a complete description, `Radius` and `InnerRadius` are the effective world
radii in metres. For an unsupported transform, they retain the authored radii
converted to metres; the status indicates that no world circular radius is
available. `directrix_metrics` gives `total_length` and one entry per directrix
segment, with a matching `segment_index` and centreline `length` in world
metres. Arc entries have a positive `bend_angle` in radians; line entries have
`bend_angle=None`. The signed arc `sweep_angle` on `Directrix` still gives
travel direction. These are geometric bend angles, without bend allowances or
fabrication deductions. The buffer path uses integer keys; the JSON path uses
string object keys.

For complete, unmodified source sweeps, `nominal_quantities` contains
`cross_section_area`, `nominal_volume`, `outer_lateral_area`, and optional
`inner_lateral_area` in m²/m³. They are calculated from the world-space radii
and directrix length; they are estimates, not authored `IfcElementQuantity`
values or net quantities. Self-overlap and mitred joins can change the physical
body. The field is `None` for unsupported paths, CSG operands, broken joins,
degenerate segments, and arcs whose radius does not exceed the disk radius.
Sharp but joined mitres remain nominal estimates.

```python
data = ifclite_geom.geometry_data_buffers(ifc_bytes, include_directrices=True)
for step_id, sweeps in data["swept_disks"].items():
    for sweep in sweeps:
        metrics = sweep["directrix_metrics"]
        if metrics is None:
            print(step_id, sweep["status"])
            continue
        print(step_id, "centreline metres:", metrics["total_length"])
        for segment, measured in zip(sweep["Directrix"], metrics["segments"]):
            if segment["type"] == "line":
                print(step_id, segment["start"], segment["end"], measured["length"])
            else:  # circular arc
                print(step_id, segment["center"], segment["radius"],
                      measured["bend_angle"])
```

An arc also carries `normal`, `x_axis`, `start_angle`, and `sweep_angle` to
define its orientation and travel. `status` is `{"type": "complete"}` or
`{"type": "unsupported", "reason": ...}`; unsupported paths have no partial
segments and `directrix_metrics=None`. `source_modified=True` means the sweep is
a source operand and later booleans may alter the final solid. Inspect that
field before using the source path for fabrication. The flag does not describe
cuts from external `IfcRelVoidsElement` openings. Extraction issues appear in
`directrix_diagnostics`. With the flag omitted, both functions keep their
existing output shape and skip this extraction.

### `check_swept_disks(ifc_bytes: bytes, ids: set[int] | None = None, *, zero_length_tolerance_m: float = 1e-9, gap_tolerance_m: float = 1e-6, tangent_tolerance_rad: float = 1e-6) -> dict`

Run numerical checks on authored `IfcSweptDiskSolid` paths, without a mesh
pass. The function extracts each selected occurrence once and runs the shared
Rust checker on each source solid. Results are keyed by occurrence STEP id;
multiple sweeps under one occurrence stay separate and retain `occurrence_index`, `solid_id`,
`directrix_id`, and `mapping_path`. `diagnostics` reports problems traversing
the representation. `ids` filters product occurrences as it does in the
geometry functions; an empty set returns empty `elements`.

```python
checks = ifclite_geom.check_swept_disks(ifc_bytes)
for step_id, entries in checks["elements"].items():
    for entry in entries:
        report = entry["report"]
        if report["skipped_reason"] is not None:
            print(step_id, "uncheckable:", report["skipped_reason"])
            continue
        for finding in report["findings"]:
            print(step_id, entry["solid_id"], finding["code"],
                  finding["segment_index"], finding["measured"])
```

Each finding carries a stable `code`, `segment_index`, optional
`next_segment_index` for a join, measured value, threshold and units (`m` or
`rad`). Codes are `zero_length_segment`, `consecutive_gap`,
`tangent_discontinuity`, and `arc_radius_not_greater_than_disk_radius`.
The defaults flag segments at or below 1 nanometre, gaps above 1 micrometre,
and tangent changes above 1 microradian. Supply finite, nonnegative tolerances
to suit the model; invalid values raise `ValueError` even when `ids` is empty.
An unsupported analytic path has a `skipped_reason` and no partial findings.
`source_modified=True` means the checker measured an authored CSG operand,
which may differ from the finished body. These geometric findings do not
certify fabrication compliance or calculate bend allowances. IFC allows
non-tangent consecutive segments to form a miter, so
`tangent_discontinuity` is an inspection cue rather than an automatic schema
violation ([IfcSweptDiskSolid](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4x3/HTML/lexical/IfcSweptDiskSolid.htm)).

### `swept_disk_definitions(ifc_bytes: bytes, ids: set[int] | None = None) -> dict`

Return one source definition per representation-map path and solid, with one
instance per use in a product. This is an opt-in, untessellated view; the
flattened `include_directrices=True` contract is unchanged. `sources` contain
authored `Radius`, `InnerRadius`, and `Directrix` in the IFC file's length
units. `instances` is keyed by product STEP id and preserves deterministic
`ordinal`, `mapping_path` (mapped-item STEP ids), `source_modified`, and
`status`. The `source` key contains the SHA-256 of the IFC bytes, `FILE_SCHEMA`,
unit scale (as 16 hex digits of its f64 bits), solid STEP id, and either a
top-level representation id or ordered `IfcRepresentationMap` ids. Repeated
`MappingTarget`s therefore share a source
without collapsing distinct uses.

`world_from_source` is a column-major 4×4 f64 matrix mapping source file-unit
coordinates directly to absolute IFC Z-up metres. It includes the file length
scale, product placement, and nested mapping transforms. The source radius is
raw; a uniform instance's effective world radius also includes the matrix's
uniform scale. A nonuniform instance carries `status=unsupported` because its
world disk is not circular. An invalid matrix is `None` with an unsupported
status. Source and instance output have independent work budgets; truncation
appears in `diagnostics`.

```python
view = ifclite_geom.swept_disk_definitions(ifc_bytes, ids={50})
for instance in view["instances"].get(50, []):
    print(instance["source"], instance["world_from_source"])
```

### `extrusion_definitions(ifc_bytes: bytes, ids: set[int] | None = None) -> dict`

Return exact authored `IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` profiles once per source and a
separate record for each product occurrence. Sources retain raw IFC file-length
units, `ProfileType`, ordered line and arc loops, signed area and perimeter,
authored `DirectionRatios`, normalized `axis_unit_vector`, and `Depth`.
Complete sources with valid positive net profile area carry
`nominal_quantities` from the shared Rust calculator: net profile area in
squared file units, projected height in file units, and their nominal volume
in cubed file units. Unsupported or invalid sources have
`nominal_quantities=None`.
Unsupported or tapered sources carry an explicit `status`; no approximate
boundary is substituted. A source key uses the same model/schema/unit/context
identity as `swept_disk_definitions`, so repeated `MappingTarget`s share a
definition while each use has its own deterministic `ordinal` and mapped-item
path. `source_modified=True` marks a CSG operand whose final body can differ.

For a complete source-profile point, apply `profile_position`, then the
extrusion's `position_matrix`, then the occurrence's `world_from_source`.
Matrices are column-major f64. The first two use raw IFC file units; the last
includes file-unit scale and maps to absolute IFC Z-up world metres. When an
optional `Position` is absent, its matrix field is `None` (JSON `null`): use
identity for that step when composing transforms, rather than expecting an
identity array in the response. Check `status` before using an absent matrix;
an invalid reference can also leave an unsupported source without one. A
non-finite transform is `None`; a singular transform retains its matrix, and
both have unsupported status.
Source reference keys use exact IFC names: both profile and extrusion carry
`Position`, and the extrusion carries `ExtrudedDirection`; the separate
derived matrices keep their descriptive names.
The API does not infer a post-boolean solid or a world volume from a raw source.
Source and occurrence budgets are independent; truncation is reported in
`diagnostics`.

```python
view = ifclite_geom.extrusion_definitions(ifc_bytes, ids={50})
for instance in view["instances"].get(50, []):
    print(instance["source"], instance["world_from_source"])
```

### `authored_quantity_analysis(ifc_bytes: bytes, ids: set[int] | None = None) -> dict`

Return IFC-authored quantities keyed by actual product STEP ID without meshing.
Each observation retains the exact `IfcElementQuantity.Name` and
`IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity.Name`, both source entity IDs, kind, numeric value,
and occurrence or inherited type origin. A same-named occurrence/type disagreement
appears in `conflicts`; neither value is overwritten. `unit` records the resolved
symbol, SI factor, source, and explicit unit ID where present. If a unit cannot
be resolved or has the wrong dimension, `unit=None` and `unit_diagnostic`
explains why. `IfcQuantityCount` and IFC4X3 `IfcQuantityNumber` are
dimensionless when no unit is supplied; a resolved explicit named unit is
preserved instead of being discarded.

```python
view = ifclite_geom.authored_quantity_analysis(ifc_bytes, ids={50})
for quantity in view["products"].get(50, {}).get("authored", []):
    print(quantity["set_name"], quantity["quantity_name"], quantity["value"], quantity["unit"])
```

`product_count` counts selected IFC product entities. It is not a physical bar
count, source-solid count, cutting length or material takeoff. This authored
view contains no calculated estimate; use the analytic source APIs separately
and keep their provenance distinct. A malformed or over-budget relationship
or quantity set appears in `diagnostics`. An absent optional
`IfcTypeObject.HasPropertySets` is valid; a malformed list or member is
reported and its type-authored quantities are refused. Conflicting
`IfcRelDefinesByType` assignments likewise refuse type inheritance for that
product while preserving its occurrence-authored observations.

### `quantity_analysis(ifc_bytes: bytes, ids: set[int] | None = None) -> dict`

Join authored `IfcElementQuantity` observations with exact analytic swept-disk
and extrusion source occurrences. `products` is keyed by product STEP ID;
`authored` retains exact names, IDs, units, origin and conflicts. Each entry in
`sources` keeps its canonical source key, solid ID, mapping path, ordinal,
status and nominal values with formula, origin, unit and limitation. Swept-disk centreline
and section estimates use world metres; extrusion depth and profile estimates
remain in raw IFC file units because an occurrence transform may scale them.
`Depth` is an authored solid parameter, not an `IfcElementQuantity` value.

```python
view = ifclite_geom.quantity_analysis(ifc_bytes, ids={50})
for source in view["products"][50]["sources"]:
    for estimate in source["quantities"]:
        print(source["solid_id"], estimate["name"], estimate["value"], estimate["unit"])
```

`product_count` counts IFC products, `source_occurrence_count` counts uses of
analytic solids, and `unique_source_count` counts distinct source definitions.
Mapped products can share one source. `product_total` is always `None` with an
`aggregate_diagnostic`: source estimates exclude voids, CSG results, overlap,
self-intersection and cutting allowances. They cannot establish a physical
part count or final material quantity. Unsupported and source-modified sources
retain explicit status; extraction failures appear in `diagnostics`.
When a complete swept-disk occurrence has no defensible nominal section or
volume estimate, `status_reason` explains the omission even if its centreline
length remains available. Joined diagnostics have one bounded output budget.

### Reinforcing-bar schedule inputs

`rebar_schedule(ifc_bytes, ids=None)` returns one row per selected
`IfcReinforcingBar`, including bars with no supported swept-disk geometry.
Each row exposes the occurrence's `GlobalId` and `Name` under their exact
EXPRESS names.
Authored attributes use exact EXPRESS names and record whether they came from
the occurrence or its `IfcReinforcingBarType`. Numeric attributes retain their
raw IFC value and an SI conversion. An authored `CrossSectionArea` of zero
remains in the record, with a row diagnostic stating that it does not establish
a physical section area. Each source sweep separately carries
radius, centreline length and bend angles, geometric checks, and reusable
`source` identity. For complete paths, radii are effective world values in
metres; an unsupported transform retains source radii in metres and does not
establish a world circular radius. If a file's unit conversion makes a radius
non-finite, the binding raises `ValueError` instead of returning JSON `null`.
Mapped repetitions remain separate, while repeated
uses of one representation map share a source key. If the independent definition
output budget is exhausted, `source` is `None` with a row diagnostic; the
world-space schedule sweep remains available. An authored `BarLength`
can differ from the derived centreline length; neither value is a certified
cutting length. IFC bar entities and represented sweeps do not imply a physical
bar count.

```python
schedule = ifclite_geom.rebar_schedule(ifc_bytes)
for step_id, row in schedule["rows"].items():
    print(step_id, row["GlobalId"], row["Name"], row["authored"].get("BarLength"), row["sweeps"])
```

For project-specific comparisons, call
`rebar_schedule_with_preflight(ifc_bytes, min_inside_bend_radius_m,
min_straight_segment_length_m, max_developed_centreline_length_m=None)`.
The measured comparisons identify their source segments; equality passes.
Inside bend radius is arc centreline radius minus swept outer radius. Modified
or unsupported sources and rows without sweeps carry explicit skip reasons.
For a skipped sweep, `comparisons` is `None`; an assessed sweep has a list of
measured comparisons. Check `skipped_reason` before interpreting pass results.
No result certifies a cutting length or fabrication-code compliance.

### Tessellation quality

Both geometry functions take an optional `quality` label:

| label | density | 
|---|---|
| `"lowest"` | quarter |
| `"low"` | half |
| `"medium"` | engine default, used when `quality` is omitted |
| `"high"` | double |
| `"highest"` | quadruple |

It scales the segment count on every curved primitive: swept-disk tubes,
cylinders, revolutions, arcs, circular profiles. On curve-heavy elements the
effect is large. A single `IfcReinforcingBar` authored as an `IfcSweptDiskSolid`
over a composite arc tessellates to 1056 triangles at `"medium"` and 96 at
`"lowest"`.

```python
data = ifclite_geom.geometry_data_buffers(ifc_bytes, "lowest")
```

An unrecognised label raises `ValueError` rather than silently falling back, so
a typo cannot cost you a 10x triangle budget without saying so. This is the same
knob the browser build exposes as `setTessellationQuality` and the server as
`?tessellation_quality=`; the level is model-wide, not per IFC type.

### Filter by IFC STEP id

Both geometry functions accept an optional `ids` set. Only matching occurrence
ids are tessellated, which lets you select products through `entity_data` first
without paying to mesh the rest of the model:

```python
entities = ifclite_geom.entity_data(ifc_bytes)
wall_ids = {
    step_id
    for step_id, row in entities["entities"].items()
    if row["ifc_type"] == "IfcWall"
}
walls = ifclite_geom.geometry_data_buffers(ifc_bytes, ids=wall_ids)
```

`ids=None` preserves the unfiltered behaviour. An empty set returns zero
elements, and ids not present in the file are ignored. The pipeline still
resolves relationship and representation dependencies: for example, selecting
a wall keeps its unselected `IfcOpeningElement` cutters available to the wall's
CSG operation without emitting meshes for those openings.

### `entity_data(ifc_bytes, placements=False, type_properties=True, attributes=True) -> dict`

Attributes, property sets and quantity sets. No tessellation runs, so this is
cheap compared with the geometry functions.

```text
{
  "length_unit_scale": 0.001,      # file length unit -> metres
  "plane_angle_to_radians": 0.0174,
  "project_id": 42,                # may be None
  "entity_count": 1234,
  "entities": {
    <step_id:int>: {
      "ifc_type":      "IfcWall",
      "global_id":     "3vB2...",       # may be None
      "name":          "WALL 1",        # may be None
      "description":   None,
      "object_type":   None,
      "has_geometry":  True,
      "placement":     None,            # see below
      "property_sets": [
        {"name": "Pset_WallCommon",
         "properties": [{"name": "IsExternal", "value": "True",
                         "value_type": "IFCBOOLEAN"}]},
      ],
      "quantity_sets": [
        {"name": "Qto_WallBaseQuantities",
         "quantities": [{"name": "Length", "value": 3000.0, "kind": "Length"}]},
      ],
      "attributes": [                  # schema-declared entity attributes
        {"name": "PredefinedType", "value": "SOLIDWALL", "value_type": "IFCENUM"},
      ],
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

`entities` is keyed by IFC STEP id in file order, the same key
`geometry_data_buffers` uses, so the two join directly. The join is one-way
total: every meshed element has a row, but not every row has an element, so
drive the loop from `elements` (or use `.get()`) rather than the other way
round. Besides products with no geometry, an orphan `IfcTypeProduct` carries
`has_geometry: True` and still never appears in `elements`, because the
geometry functions emit occurrences only.

```python
geom = ifclite_geom.geometry_data_buffers(ifc_bytes)
ents = ifclite_geom.entity_data(ifc_bytes)

for step_id, el in geom["elements"].items():
    row = ents["entities"].get(step_id)
    if row:
        print(el["ifc_type"], row["name"], row["property_sets"])
```

Pass `placements=True` to also resolve each product's `ObjectPlacement` into a
list of 16 floats: a **column-major** 4x4, translation in metres at indices
12/13/14. It is off by default because it costs an extra decode per product.

The matrix is in the **same absolute IFC world frame as
`geometry_data_buffers` vertices**, so the two line up directly. Do not fold
`rtc_offset` into either: the geometry export already adds it back into every
vertex, and the placement is never RTC-rebased. On a georeferenced model both
are large absolute coordinates, and a product's placement origin lands inside
its own mesh bounds.

#### Units, and two current limits

- **Property and quantity values are in the file's own units**, unlike geometry,
  which is always metres. A millimetre model reports a wall length of `3000`.
  Property values are always strings; quantity values are floats.

  Converting is per dimension, not one blanket factor:

  | quantity kind | to SI |
  |---|---|
  | `Length` | `value * length_unit_scale` |
  | `Area` | `value * length_unit_scale ** 2` |
  | `Volume` | `value * length_unit_scale ** 3` |
  | `Count` | unchanged (dimensionless) |
  | angles (properties) | `value * plane_angle_to_radians` |

  Only the length and plane-angle scales are resolved, so a model that declares
  an area or volume unit inconsistent with its length unit cannot be reconciled
  from what is returned here.
- **Only `IfcPropertySingleValue` properties are decoded.** Enumerated, list,
  bounded, table and reference properties are skipped; the pset still appears,
  with those entries missing.
### Entity attributes

Note the two senses of "type" on this page. The section below concerns an
`IfcTypeObject`, the shared definition an occurrence inherits from. This one
concerns the IFC **entity class** (`IfcWall`, `IfcReinforcingBar`) and the
attributes its schema declares. They are unrelated.

`attributes` is on by default. These are **not** property sets and no amount of
pset work surfaces them, because they are declared on the entity itself:

```python
row = ents["entities"][step_id]
{a["name"]: a["value"] for a in row["attributes"]}
# A bar with every attribute set:
# {'Tag': 'TAG-1', 'SteelGrade': 'B500B', 'NominalDiameter': '29',
#  'CrossSectionArea': '660', 'BarLength': '500',
#  'PredefinedType': 'NOTDEFINED', 'BarSurface': 'PLAIN'}
#
# A bar leaving most of them `$`, which is the common case:
# {'NominalDiameter': '29', 'CrossSectionArea': '0',
#  'PredefinedType': 'NOTDEFINED'}
```

**Only what the file sets is returned.** An attribute left `$` is omitted
rather than reported empty, so the list is usually shorter than the class
declares, and its length varies between two entities of the same class.

Every IFC entity class has its own schema-declared attributes: `IfcDoor` yields
`OverallHeight` / `OverallWidth`, and so on, named and ordered as the schema
declares them. Entries share the `{name, value, value_type}` shape of a
property, so one code path reads both.

Fields the row already carries (`global_id`, `name`, `description`,
`object_type`) are not repeated, and reference-valued attributes are omitted
rather than rendered as a dangling `#123`. Pass `attributes=False` to skip.

### Type-inherited properties

`type_properties` is on by default. A type attaches its sets through
`IfcTypeObject.HasPropertySets` and gets no row of its own unless it carries
orphan geometry, so without this the properties authoring tools put on types
are unreachable. Each occurrence therefore also carries what it inherits
through `IfcRelDefinesByType`, merged **per property**:

- A type set whose name the occurrence does not use is added whole.
- A type set sharing a name contributes only the properties the occurrence does
  not already define. On a collision the occurrence wins, and the type-only
  properties beside it still survive. Replacing the whole set instead would
  hide them, which is the bug this rule exists to prevent.

**`quantity_sets` inherit on exactly the same terms.** A type attaches
`IfcElementQuantity` definitions through the same `HasPropertySets` attribute,
so they arrive by the same route and merge by the same rule: a type quantity
set the occurrence does not name is added whole, and a same-named one
contributes only the quantities the occurrence does not already define, so the
occurrence wins a collision. `type_properties` governs both lists; there is no
separate switch.

```python
# Own sets only, as in 4.3.0. Affects property_sets AND quantity_sets.
ents = ifclite_geom.entity_data(ifc_bytes, type_properties=False)
```

This mirrors what the browser has done since the same fix landed there, so a
property visible in the viewer is now visible here.

## Notes

- **One mesh per element.** Per-material submeshes of an element are merged into a
  single indexed triangle soup, keyed by its IFC STEP id.
- **Coordinates are absolute world metres.** The per-element local frame and the
  model RTC offset are folded back into every vertex. For geo-referenced models
  `rtc_offset` is non-zero; subtract it if you want f32-friendly local
  coordinates.
- **Welded and indexed.** Coincident corners are merged (1 micron grid), so
  closed-mesh consumers (volume, watertightness checks) work directly.
- **Occurrences only.** Type-product / RepresentationMap geometry is not
  emitted, matching what occurrence-based tessellators produce.
- **Errors** surface as `RuntimeError` (pipeline failure) or `ValueError` (an
  unrecognised `quality` label, or JSON serialization failure).

## Examples

Runnable scripts live in [`examples/`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/tree/main/rust/python/examples):

- [`quickstart_numpy.py`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/blob/main/rust/python/examples/quickstart_numpy.py) - load a file and
  inspect meshes via numpy.
- [`dump_json.py`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/blob/main/rust/python/examples/dump_json.py) - write the JSON document to disk.
- [`export_obj.py`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/blob/main/rust/python/examples/export_obj.py) - write every element to a single
  Wavefront `.obj` (numpy only, no extra deps).
- [`schedule_csv.py`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/blob/main/rust/python/examples/schedule_csv.py) - join `entity_data` against
  `geometry_data_buffers` and write a quantity schedule to CSV (stdlib only).
