# MCP for AI Agents

The `@ifc-lite/mcp` package turns any IFC model into a set of tools an LLM agent can call. It speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) over JSON-RPC, so agents like Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Goose, and Zed can query, validate, edit, and visualize real building models directly, no browser and no bespoke integration required. For a BIM audience: it is the same query, geometry, clash, IDS, BCF, and export capabilities you get from the [CLI](cli.md), exposed as agent-callable tools with a permission model on top.

The server bundles the same headless kernel the [CLI](cli.md) and [server](server.md) use, and can optionally drive the WebGL viewer so an agent paints results into a live 3D scene.

## Quickstart

### stdio (local agents)

The default transport is stdio, the mode Claude Desktop and Cursor expect. Pass one or more IFC files as positional arguments and they are preloaded into the model registry:

```bash
# Single model over stdio
ifc-lite mcp ./model.ifc

# Read-only (mutation tools are hidden, not just refused)
ifc-lite mcp ./model.ifc --read-only

# Federate several files into one session
ifc-lite mcp ./arch.ifc ./struct.ifc ./mep.ifc

# Also open the WebGL viewer at startup
ifc-lite mcp ./model.ifc --viewer
```

You can also invoke the package directly with `npx @ifc-lite/mcp ./model.ifc`. Both entry points share the same runtime and flags.

### HTTP (remote agents)

The Streamable HTTP transport serves remote agents:

```bash
ifc-lite mcp ./model.ifc --transport http --port 8765 --token $API_TOKEN
```

!!! warning "HTTP sessions start with an empty registry"
    In `--transport http` mode the positional files are **not** preloaded. Every
    HTTP session gets its own fresh, empty model registry. The agent loads a
    model into its session with the `model_load` tool, which needs `mutate`
    scope, so it is hidden under `--read-only`. Only the default `stdio`
    transport preloads the files you pass on the command line. This isolation is
    deliberate: two sessions that load different files which derive the same
    internal id never alias each other's state.

    A corollary: `--read-only` combined with `--transport http` produces
    sessions that have no way to load a model at all (the registry starts
    empty and `model_load` is hidden). For read-only serving of preloaded
    files, use the `stdio` transport.

By default the server binds `127.0.0.1`. Binding a non-loopback host requires either a `--token` (which becomes the bearer token for full scope) or the `--insecure` flag for development only. The token travels as a plaintext `Authorization` header: the CLI itself serves plain HTTP, so any non-loopback deployment must sit behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer), or the bearer token is readable by anyone on the network path.

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--transport <t>` | `stdio` (default) or `http` |
| `--port <N>` | HTTP port (default 8765) |
| `--host <h>` | HTTP host (default 127.0.0.1; non-loopback requires `--token` or `--insecure`) |
| `--token <bearer>` | HTTP bearer token that maps to full scope |
| `--insecure` | Allow a non-loopback bind without a token (development only) |
| `--read-only` | Hide mutation tools |
| `--bsdd <url>` | Override the bSDD endpoint |
| `--allow <path>` | Restrict file-system access (repeatable) |
| `--viewer` | Auto-open the 3D viewer |
| `--viewer-port <N>` | Preferred viewer port (0 = auto) |
| `--open` | Auto-open the viewer **and** open its URL in the browser |

## Scopes and permissions

Every tool declares the scope a caller needs. At `tools/list` time the server filters the advertised set by the session's scope, so an agent never even sees a tool it is not allowed to call, which keeps it from attempting a forbidden operation.

| Scope | Grants |
|-------|--------|
| `read` | Discovery, query, geometry metrics, viewer reads |
| `validate` | IDS validation, model audit |
| `export` | Data and geometry export |
| `mutate` | Property/attribute edits, entity create/delete, model load/save |
| `admin` | All of the above |

Two presets ship out of the box:

- **Full access** (`read`, `validate`, `mutate`, `export`, `admin`) is the default.
- **Read-only** (`read`, `validate`, `export`) is what `--read-only` selects; it omits `mutate`.

A scope can also carry an optional `modelIds` allowlist to restrict a session to specific models.

## What the server exposes

!!! tip "`model_diff` and re-exported models"
    `model_diff` compares by GlobalId, so two files that describe the same
    building read as *the whole model deleted and re-added* when the second was
    re-exported from scratch. Pass `by_content: true` to route the same two
    models through the [`@ifc-lite/diff` engine](model-diff.md), which matches
    entities by content. It is opt-in and stays off by default: an ambiguous
    group has no honest scalar form, so turning it on would change what the
    existing numbers mean. Either way the diff reflects any edits the session
    has queued but not yet saved, and says how many. See [Content diffing over
    MCP](model-diff.md#mcp-usage).

!!! tip "Reading back an edit you just made"
    A `model_id` names a *session*, not a file. `entity_set_property`,
    `entity_set_attribute`, `entity_create` and `entity_delete` queue their edits
    in an overlay that only reaches disk at `export_ifc` / `model_save`, so the
    read tools fold that overlay in and answer about the model as the session
    has it.

    That covers existence, attributes, properties, quantities **and
    containment**: `get_entity`, `get_entities_bulk`, `query_entities` (filters
    included — a query for the value you just wrote finds it, and `in_storey`
    finds an entity you created and placed with a queued
    `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure`), `count_entities`, `model_info`,
    `model_list`, `properties_unique`, `materials_list`,
    `classifications_list`, `spatial_hierarchy`, `containment_chain`,
    `model_audit` and `model_diff` — plus the `ifc-lite://model/{id}/manifest`,
    `…/entity/{globalId}` and `…/spatial-tree` resources. A created entity is
    reachable by the GlobalId you gave it, and by the `expressId` every
    `query_entities` row carries; a deleted one is reported as not found, and a
    deleted `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` or `IfcRelAggregates` record
    stops affecting the containment reads above. **Only containment.** The
    `relationships` tool reads voids, fills, groups and connections from the
    parsed graph, so an `IfcRelVoidsElement` this session created or deleted
    shows up there only after a save and reload.

    **One GlobalId, one entity, whichever tool asks.** A GlobalId is supposed to
    be unique and in practice is not — a session can create an entity under an id
    the file already uses. `get_entity`, `get_entities_bulk`, `entity_set_*`,
    `entity_delete` and `bsdd_match` all resolve it the same way: **an entity
    this session created wins over a same-GlobalId entity in the file**, and a
    deleted entity never resolves at all. `get_entities_bulk` additionally
    reports any key that named more than one live entity in
    `ambiguousGlobalIds` (`globalId`, every `expressIds` it saw, and which one it
    `returned`), so a duplicate is something you are told about rather than
    something you have to notice. Address the other one by `express_id`.

    **Type names are IfcPascalCase** in `model_info.typeCountsTop20`,
    `count_entities(group_by: 'type')` and `model_diff.typeDiffs` alike — the
    first two used to emit the raw uppercase STEP key. `count_entities` also
    honours `type` on the `group_by: 'type'` branch now (it was ignored), and
    expands subtypes the way `query_entities` does.

    **`pendingMutations` is a number wherever it appears, never an object.**
    `model_diff` used to publish a `{ base, head }` object under that name
    inside `contentDiff`; the per-side split now lives in
    `contentDiff.pendingMutationsBySide` and `pendingMutations` is the scalar
    total, at the top level and inside `contentDiff`. This is about its *type*
    when present, not about whether it is present — see below.

    Every one of those payloads carries `pendingMutations` — the same number
    `mutation_diff` reports — whenever the session has unsaved edits, and the
    field is **absent** when it has none. That is the line between "in this
    session" and "on disk": nothing is written until you call `export_ifc` or
    `model_save`.

    **The saved file agrees with the session, including under a filter.**
    `export_ifc`'s optional `global_ids` allowlist resolves against the folded
    model, so an entity this session created can be named in it and lands in the
    file. It used to be resolved and then filtered against the parsed model
    alone, which dropped created entities from the output silently.

    An allowlist that matches **nothing** now fails with `ENTITY_NOT_FOUND`
    rather than exporting the whole model: an empty match set used to fall
    through to an unfiltered save, so asking for one entity could write every
    entity in the model to disk and report success. Nothing is written when it
    fails. Ids that match nothing while *others* do are not an error — they come
    back in `unmatchedGlobalIds` and the matched ones still export.

    **What does not fold, and therefore never claims `pendingMutations`:**
    `relationships` (voids, fills, groups and connections come from a
    parser-side extractor with no overlay seam — unlike containment, which
    routes through the backend the mutation tools share), `units` and
    `georeferencing` (header data no mutation tool writes), and the geometry,
    clash and viewer tools (the parsed geometry, which queued edits do not
    regenerate). Save and reload to bring those up to date.

!!! tip "Schema reach beyond IFC4"
    The parser's entity registry is generated from IFC4_ADD2_TC1, and both
    `model_audit` and `schema_describe` used to answer from it alone. They now
    consult every bundled schema. `model_audit`'s GlobalId-uniqueness check
    covers the 39 IFC2X3 and 80 IFC4X3 `IfcRoot` classes the pin has no row for
    — it used to skip them silently and score the file clean on identity without
    having looked. `schema_describe` answers for those classes instead of
    rejecting them as unknown; its payload carries `schemaSource`, which reads
    `IFC4_ADD2_TC1` when the pinned registry answered (attributes with their
    EXPRESS types) and `bundled-schema-union` when it did not (attribute names
    in positional order, no types).

!!! note "Planned tools return a clean error"
    `geometry_get`, `raycast`, `gherkin_check`, and `export_pdf_report` are
    registered so agents can discover them, but they currently return an
    `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION` result rather than data. Mesh geometry (`geometry_get`)
    and `raycast` need the WASM geometry pipeline; `gherkin_check` awaits the bSI
    Gherkin grammar; `export_pdf_report` is slated for a later release.

### Resources

Live model state is exposed as MCP resources under the `ifc-lite://` URI scheme, so an agent can read current state without a tool round-trip:

```text
ifc-lite://server/manifest
ifc-lite://model/{model_id}/manifest
ifc-lite://model/{model_id}/entity/{global_id}
ifc-lite://model/{model_id}/spatial-tree
ifc-lite://model/{model_id}/materials
ifc-lite://model/{model_id}/property-sets
ifc-lite://viewer/status            (open/closed, port, client count)
ifc-lite://viewer/selection         (live; supports resources/subscribe for push updates)
```

### Prompts

The server ships pre-baked prompts that encode BIM expertise, so an agent can run a whole workflow from one prompt: `audit_model`, `find_fire_rated_doors`, `generate_bcf_from_ids`, `compare_versions`, `space_program_check`, `clash_review`, `prop_quality_pass`, `migrate_to_ifcx`, `visual_audit`, `interactive_property_inspect`, and `visualize_query`.

## Live 3D viewer

When the viewer is open, every viewer-touching tool drives the live scene, and any element the user clicks in the browser flows back to the agent. The intended etiquette is:

1. Call `viewer_ask` with a `reason`; it returns suggested wording so the agent can ask the user for permission.
2. After the user agrees, call `viewer_open`; the result includes the URL to share.
3. Drive the visualization with `viewer_colorize`, `viewer_color_by_property`, `viewer_isolate`, `viewer_fly_to`, `viewer_set_section`, and friends.
4. Subscribe to `ifc-lite://viewer/selection` to be notified on each pick. `viewer_get_selection` reads the latest pick; `viewer_wait_for_selection` blocks until the next click.
5. `viewer_close` when done.

## Wiring it into a client

=== "Claude Code"

    Register the server with the `claude mcp add` command:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add ifc-lite -- npx -y @ifc-lite/mcp /abs/path/to/model.ifc
    ```

    Or commit a project-scoped `.mcp.json` so the whole team shares it:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "ifc-lite": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@ifc-lite/mcp", "/abs/path/to/model.ifc"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Claude Desktop"

    Add the server to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "ifc-lite": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@ifc-lite/mcp", "/abs/path/to/model.ifc"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Restart Claude Desktop and the ifc-lite tools appear in the tool picker.

=== "Streamable HTTP client"

    Start the server over HTTP, then point any MCP-aware Streamable HTTP client
    at it with the bearer token:

    ```bash
    ifc-lite mcp ./model.ifc --transport http --port 8765 --token my-secret
    ```

    ```
    Endpoint:   http://127.0.0.1:8765
    Header:     Authorization: Bearer my-secret
    ```

    Remember to call `model_load` first: an HTTP session starts empty.

Cursor, Windsurf, Goose, and Zed all accept the same `npx @ifc-lite/mcp <file>` stdio command.

## Errors that keep the agent in the loop

Domain errors come back inside the tool result with `isError: true` and a stable `structuredContent.code`, rather than aborting the JSON-RPC call. That keeps the model reasoning instead of failing the chain:

```jsonc
{
  "isError": true,
  "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Entity not found in model 'arch'" }],
  "structuredContent": {
    "code": "ENTITY_NOT_FOUND",
    "details": { "model_id": "arch", "express_id": 42 },
    "hint": "Use query_entities to discover valid IDs."
  }
}
```

## Programmatic embedding

For a Tauri, Electron, or Node host, build a server and wire it to a transport directly. The public surface is exported from `@ifc-lite/mcp`:

```ts
import {
  createMCPServer,
  StdioTransport,
  loadIfcModel,
  InMemoryModelRegistry,
} from '@ifc-lite/mcp';

const registry = new InMemoryModelRegistry();
registry.add(await loadIfcModel('./model.ifc'));

const server = createMCPServer({ version: '0.1.0', registry });
const transport = new StdioTransport();
await transport.connect(server);
```

For an in-process host (no child process, no sockets), use `InProcessTransport` and send JSON-RPC envelopes directly:

```ts
import { InProcessTransport } from '@ifc-lite/mcp';

const transport = new InProcessTransport();
await transport.connect(server);

const initResp = await transport.send({
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'initialize',
  params: {
    protocolVersion: '2025-11-05',
    capabilities: {},
    clientInfo: { name: 'host', version: '1' },
  },
});
```

The server negotiates MCP protocol version `2025-11-05` and accepts the neighbouring published revisions, downgrading anything it does not recognize.

## Why agents plus BIM

MCP is the richest integration: stateful sessions, live viewer control, subscriptions, and a permission model. But it is not the only way to give an agent BIM capability. If your agent already runs shell commands, the [CLI](cli.md) is often enough:

- `ifc-lite ask model.ifc "how many walls?"` answers common questions in plain language through a local recipe engine, with no external AI service involved.
- `ifc-lite eval model.ifc "<expr>"` runs arbitrary SDK expressions, and `ifc-lite schema` dumps the full API so an agent can discover it first.

Reach for MCP when you want the model held open across a conversation, the viewer in the loop, or scoped permissions. Reach for the CLI when a one-shot command answers the question. Both share the same kernel, so results are consistent either way.

See the [`@ifc-lite/mcp` README](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/tree/main/packages/mcp) for the complete tool and resource catalogue.
