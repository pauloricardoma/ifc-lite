# Web viewer pointer controls

These controls apply to the first-party web viewer, with one model or a federation of models.

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left drag | Orbit, except when the active tool claims the drag |
| Shift + left drag | Pan in every tool, including Measure |
| Middle drag | Pan in every tool |
| Right drag | Fly mode: look around while the button is held; use WASD and Q/E to move, and the wheel to change fly speed |
| Wheel without right drag | Zoom |

The Select tool uses Ctrl/⌘ + left drag for rectangle selection. In the Measure
tool, plain left drag starts a drag measurement; Alt + left drag orbits instead.
In polyline, angle, and radius measurement modes, a left drag orbits and clicks
place points. Shift + left drag always pans, even when a measurement is active.

In the Model workspace, plain left movement and dragging update the active
command preview without moving the camera. Placement commands commit on
click; polygon placement still closes on double-click. Room shape editing
grabs a corner on press, previews its movement, and commits on release as one
Undo/Redo operation. A lost capture, focus loss, or command change cancels the
owned room drag. A captured drag can finish outside the canvas. Shift + left,
middle, and right-button navigation keep the controls above.

While you orbit, a small accent marker shows the fixed point the camera is
rotating around. The marker follows that point on screen and fades when you
release the pointer. Panning does not show a pivot marker.

An embed with camera controls disabled does not fly or navigate. Right-button
fly is the viewer's established behavior (#4868); it takes priority over the
ordinary right-button pan mapping used when fly is unavailable.

## Navigation presets

Choose a preset in **Settings → Display → Navigation**. The choice is saved in
this browser and applies to every loaded model.

| Preset | Pointer difference | Wheel or trackpad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | The mapping above | Vertical wheel movement zooms; horizontal movement pans |
| Navisworks-like | Shift + middle drag orbits; middle drag pans | Wheel zooms |
| Trackpad | The default pointer mapping | Two-finger scroll pans in both directions; pinch or Ctrl + wheel zooms |

Right-button fly remains available in every preset when camera controls are
enabled. Shift + left drag pans in every preset and tool.

## Alignment sections

Open **Section → Alignment**, select the model and its `IfcAlignment`, then
change **Horizontal distance from start** to move the cut along that axis.
The cut follows the evaluated 3D tangent, including grade and curvature.
Distance is geometric horizontal metres from the physical start; it is neither
authored chainage nor 3D arc length. Approximate supported curves are labelled.
Unresolvable units, invalid placements and unsupported curves report an error
instead of substituting a straight line.

The plane uses the selected model's frame and workspace placement. Moving that
model updates the cut; pending IFC edits rebuild the selected evaluator. Removing
the owner disables its bound cut. Closing the tool releases its worker and detaches the cut into an ordinary
custom plane. Select the alignment again to resume station control.

Dragging the plane handle makes it an ordinary custom cut and detaches it from
the alignment. Choose **Alignment** and select the axis again to resume station
control. Flip, cut visibility, cap style, cardinal cuts, face picks and section
boxes retain their ordinary behavior.

Acceptance was exercised in the production viewer with the original OIP 2017
`844_terrain_and_alignment.ifc` fixture (`IfcAlignment` #39). The distance field
moved its section through 0, 10 and 20 m; flipping the cut remained active at
20 m. An independent circular-arc calculation using the authored radius and
start heading matched the displayed horizontal station coordinates within
0.000001 m. The viewer screenshot records the rotated cut and active controls;
this check uses an original authoring-tool model, not a fabricated screenshot.

## Finding a panel

The right-hand activity rail and **Analyze → Browse panels** in the ribbon use
the same task groups. A panel can be opened from either place. Customize mode
can hide or reorder rail icons; Browse panels still lists every available panel.

| Group | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| Coordinate | Model hierarchy, properties, sources, zones, and placement |
| Check | Topics, validation, clashes, changes, and model comparison |
| Quantify | Measurements, lists, charts, costs, and schedules |
| Automate | Scripts, flows, and extensions |
| Site | Point clouds, appearance, environment, drawings, and presentations |

The Point Clouds panel remains available before a scan loads; it explains what
to load. The Session panel appears only when collaboration is enabled.

### Viewer terms

### Georeferencing rotation and scale

The model information panel's **Location** pin and **Origin Lat/Lon** show
the declared georeference origin: `IfcMapConversion.Eastings` and
`Northings` transformed from `IfcProjectedCRS` to WGS84. Picking or searching
for a new origin writes that position back to Eastings/Northings. The origin
does not depend on the geometry bounds, RTC rebasing, model rotation, or Scale.
For files whose geometry is already in absolute map coordinates, editing a
nearby origin can leave the footprint stationary under the existing
double-georeference correction; relocate that geometry through source placements.

If terrain elevation is available for a picked origin, applying it also sets
the model base at that sampled elevation. This derives `OrthogonalHeight`
using the geometry elevation; the sampled height is not copied directly to
`OrthogonalHeight`. The elevation label explains this behavior.

The footprint, 3D world and geometry exports also apply the element placements
and map conversion. They can differ from the declared origin. A geometry
centre at least 100 km from the origin raises a distance message; check the
source model's placements before treating a correct origin pin as evidence
that the geometry itself is correctly georeferenced.

The georeferencing field **Model rotation in map coordinates** is the
counterclockwise angle from map East to the model's local X-axis, viewed from
above in IFC's Z-up coordinates. Positive values rotate counterclockwise;
negative values rotate clockwise. It is derived as
`atan2(XAxisOrdinate, XAxisAbscissa)`, converted to degrees.

`IfcMapConversion.XAxisAbscissa` and `XAxisOrdinate` store a direction vector,
rather than an angle. Its length need not be 1: `(2, 2)` and `(1, 1)` both mean
`+45°`. IFC-Lite uses the direction without adding scale from the vector's
length. Editing the angle writes `XAxisAbscissa = cos(angle)` and
`XAxisOrdinate = sin(angle)`. An omitted `Scale` has an effective value of 1;
**Default: 1** distinguishes that default from an explicitly authored value.
[IFC map conversion definition](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4_3/HTML/lexical/IfcMapConversion.htm).

When comparing with Bonsai/IfcOpenShell, check which direction the angle
describes. IfcOpenShell's grid-north convention describes the inverse rotation,
from project north to grid north, so its sign is opposite. For example,
`XAxisAbscissa = 0.995644` and `XAxisOrdinate = +0.093239` give approximately
`+5.35°` model rotation here and `−5.35°` under the grid-north convention.
[IfcOpenShell angle convention](https://docs.ifcopenshell.org/autoapi/ifcopenshell/util/geolocation/index.html#ifcopenshell.util.geolocation.xaxis2angle).

To validate georeferencing, compare transformed model points with independently
known survey coordinates, including units and the complete placement chain.
Cancellation between a placement rotation and a map-conversion rotation is
only expected when the model's original map alignment is known; it is not a
general validity requirement.

## Space floors and ceilings

Select a created `IfcSpace`, enter the Model workspace, and choose **Edit space
envelope** in the command palette or the Room tool's bar. Use a front view or
an active vertical section along the roof slope. Choose **Flat**, **Sloped**,
or **Pitched** for the ceiling. Click a floor, eave, or ridge handle, move it
to a roof edge or vertex, and click again to apply the snapped elevation.
Eaves move vertically; a pitched ridge can also move between the eaves.
**Alt** suspends snapping. You can also type the storey-local floor, eave, and
ridge elevations in metres and press **Enter**. **Escape** cancels the edit.

Each applied envelope is one Undo/Redo operation. It keeps the space's
`GlobalId`, name, properties, surface styles and spatial aggregation. The exported IFC contains planar clipping solids, so sloped and
pitched ceilings survive saving and reopening. Floor areas stay unchanged;
`Height` is retained only for constant-height spaces, as required by IFC.
Gross and net volumes are updated only when their source floor areas and
volumes identify the edited body; otherwise those quantities are cleared.
Ceiling, wall and finish quantities that require construction boundaries are
also cleared, so an edit does not leave stale measurements.

Editable sources are upward vertical rectangle or simple polyline extrusions
with at most 256 footprint vertices, directly placed on their storey, plus
supported envelopes previously saved by this tool. Mapped bodies, mesh bodies,
profiles with holes, tilted extrusions, extra placement parents, explicit
quantity units, and unreadable geometry refuse before writing. Horizontal,
tilted, and box sections cannot be used for this edit. A source model that was
reprojected into another CRS is also refused.
Spaces carrying `ElevationWithFlooring` allow ceiling edits, but refuse floor
moves until the building elevation frame can be resolved.

## Autodesk cloud sources

Open **Cloud sources** from Coordinate mode and select **Autodesk Forma / Data Exchange**. The viewer administrator configures either a public APS application ID for static sign-in or a same-origin hosted session service. Hosted mode keeps Autodesk tokens on the server. Static mode keeps tokens in memory and requires sign-in after a reload. A cancelled sign-in cannot complete the pending transaction.

Browse account projects and choose **Forma Data Management files** or **Data Exchanges**. For Forma Site Design, paste a Forma site link in the project entry. IFC, IFCX/IFC5 and GLB files download through the normal loader, pinned to the listed revision. Unsupported resources show an explanation. **Cancel download** stops the active batch; completed models remain loaded.

The hosted service includes a Rust Forma proposal importer and a Windows Autodesk SDK Data Exchange exporter. Enable them with absolute executable paths in the service configuration. The details panel offers file/proposal version selection; whole-exchange IFC export supports the current version only. Generated resources remain disabled when their native importer is not configured. Configuration, deployment limits, current capabilities and the live-account verification checklist are in [Autodesk source setup](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/blob/main/packages/source-autodesk/README.md) and [the session service guide](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/blob/main/apps/autodesk-service/README.md).
