# Web viewer pointer controls

These controls apply to the first-party web viewer, with one model or a federation of models.

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left drag | Orbit, except when the active tool claims the drag |
| Shift + left drag | Pan in every tool, including Measure |
| Middle drag | Pan in every tool |
| Right drag | Fly mode: look around while the button is held; use WASD and Q/E to move, and the wheel to change fly speed |
| Wheel without right drag | Zoom |

The Select tool uses Ctrl/⌘ + left drag for rectangle selection. In the Measure
tool, plain left drag starts a drag measurement; Alt + left drag orbits instead.
In polyline, angle, and radius measurement modes, a left drag orbits and clicks
place points. Shift + left drag always pans, even when a measurement is active.

While you orbit, a small accent marker shows the fixed point the camera is
rotating around. The marker follows that point on screen and fades when you
release the pointer. Panning does not show a pivot marker.

An embed with camera controls disabled does not fly or navigate. Right-button
fly is the viewer's established behavior (#4868); it takes priority over the
ordinary right-button pan mapping used when fly is unavailable.

## Navigation presets

Choose a preset in **Settings → Display → Navigation**. The choice is saved in
this browser and applies to every loaded model.

| Preset | Pointer difference | Wheel or trackpad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | The mapping above | Vertical wheel movement zooms; horizontal movement pans |
| Navisworks-like | Shift + middle drag orbits; middle drag pans | Wheel zooms |
| Trackpad | The default pointer mapping | Two-finger scroll pans in both directions; pinch or Ctrl + wheel zooms |

Right-button fly remains available in every preset when camera controls are
enabled. Shift + left drag pans in every preset and tool.

## Finding a panel

The right-hand activity rail and **Analyze → Browse panels** in the ribbon use
the same task groups. A panel can be opened from either place. Customize mode
can hide or reorder rail icons; Browse panels still lists every available panel.

| Group | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| Coordinate | Model hierarchy, properties, sources, zones, and placement |
| Check | Topics, validation, clashes, changes, and model comparison |
| Quantify | Measurements, lists, charts, costs, and schedules |
| Automate | Scripts, flows, and extensions |
| Site | Point clouds, appearance, environment, drawings, and presentations |

The Point Clouds panel remains available before a scan loads; it explains what
to load. The Session panel appears only when collaboration is enabled.

### Viewer terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Collection | A saved working set of selected model objects. Older guides call it a basket. |
| Session | A shared live workspace with other people. Older guides call it a room. |
| Profile | A saved viewer setup, including layout and analysis settings. Older guides call it a flavor. |
| Edge shading | Point-cloud depth enhancement. Technical settings may call it EDL (Eye-Dome Lighting). |
| Spatial index | A structure that speeds up finding nearby objects. Technical material may call it a BVH. |
| Tolerance | The permitted measurement difference in a spatial check. Technical material may call it epsilon. |
| Boundary-crossing element | An element that intersects more than one location zone. Technical material may call it a straddler. |
| Write zones to model | Create IFC `IfcSpatialZone` entities for the zones; older controls said “emit zones.” |
| Validation | Checking model information against rules, including IDS requirements. |
| Clash | A spatial conflict between model objects, with clearance settings when applicable. |
| Placement | The model's position and orientation, including georeferencing. |
