# Multi-Model Federation

IFClite supports loading multiple IFC files simultaneously with unified selection, visibility, and spatial hierarchy. This is essential for real-world BIM workflows where architectural, structural, and MEP models are maintained as separate files.

## How It Works

Each loaded model is assigned a unique **ID offset** so that entity IDs never collide across models. The `FederationRegistry` manages these offsets automatically.

```
Model A: expressIds 1-5000    -> globalIds 1-5000       (offset: 0)
Model B: expressIds 1-3000    -> globalIds 5001-8000    (offset: 5000)
Model C: expressIds 1-2000    -> globalIds 8001-10000   (offset: 8000)
```

## Coordinates in a Federation

Federated models share one **RTC frame** so their meshes align pixel-for-pixel
instead of each model floating in its own re-based origin (see [Geometry
Guide → Coordinate Handling](geometry.md#coordinate-handling) for what an RTC
offset is and why the mesher applies one). One rule decides which frame that
is, and it does not depend on load order:

- **The anchor is the earliest-loaded model that has a `wasmRtcOffset`.**
  Models without one (small, near-origin coordinates) are skipped. If no model
  has one, every model is in the raw frame and there is nothing to share.
- **At load**, the viewer passes that anchor to the new model as
  `sharedRtcOffset`, so it is meshed against it
  (`apps/viewer/src/hooks/useIfcFederation.ts`, `chooseSharedRtcOffset` in
  `@ifc-lite/geometry/world-frame`).
- **After every federated load settles**, the viewer converges every other
  loaded model onto the anchor (`apps/viewer/src/hooks/ingest/federationRtcRebase.ts`,
  `convergeGeometryOntoRtcAnchor` in `@ifc-lite/geometry/rtc-rebase`). This is
  what covers a near-origin model loaded *before* the first anchored one, and
  loads that overlap and finish in either order. The move is a translation of
  each mesh's double-precision `origin` plus the model's `coordinateInfo`
  (`wasmRtcOffset`, `wasmRtcFrame`, `originalBounds`, `shiftedBounds`); the
  float32 vertex `positions` are never touched, so no precision is lost at
  map-coordinate magnitudes. A model's `coordinateInfo` can therefore change
  after it has loaded: read it when you need it rather than caching it.
- **The frame reported to consumers.** `federationFrameInfo`
  (`@ifc-lite/geometry/world-frame`) applies the same rule: the
  `coordinateInfo` of the earliest-loaded model with a `wasmRtcOffset`, or,
  when no model has one, of the earliest-loaded model with any
  `coordinateInfo`. `renderFrameWorldOffset`, BCF viewpoint export and the
  other world-coordinate readouts use it as the federation's frame.

For every model that can be converged (see the two exceptions below),
loading a near-origin model and a georeferenced model in either order gives
the same scene and the same reported frame. A model that is still streaming
does not define the reported frame until its load settles.

Two kinds of model stay outside the shared frame:

- **Point clouds** (LAS/LAZ and the other scan formats) are never meshed
  against an RTC anchor in any load order; they are placed by the point-cloud
  georeference alignment instead, so the convergence leaves them alone.
- **Models with GPU-instanced geometry** cannot be moved after load, because
  their instance transforms live in renderer-owned buffers. If such a model is
  not already on the anchor, the viewer leaves it where it is, names it in a
  warning toast, and still converges every other model. Load the
  georeferenced model first to avoid this.

### Global vs Local IDs

- **Local expressId**: The original ID within a single IFC file (e.g., `#42`)
- **Global ID**: `expressId + model.idOffset` - unique across all loaded models
- **EntityRef**: `{ modelId: string, expressId: number }` - unambiguous reference to any entity

```typescript
import { federationRegistry } from '@ifc-lite/renderer';

// Convert local to global
const globalId = federationRegistry.toGlobalId('arch-model', expressId);

// Convert global to local
const lookup = federationRegistry.fromGlobalId(globalId);
// { modelId: 'arch-model', expressId: 42 }
```

### Ids Carried on Geometry

`MeshData.expressId` is not the only id a mesh carries, and every id that is
resolved through the registry must be in the same space. When the viewer loads a
federated model it re-homes the mesh's `geometryItemId` (the
`IfcRepresentationItem` the mesh was tessellated from, see the
[Geometry Guide](geometry.md)) by the same `idOffset` as `expressId`, on the flat
path and on the instanced shards alike. So a `geometryItemId` you read off a
loaded mesh is a **global id**: pass it to `fromGlobalId` like any other, and
subtract the offset before comparing it to raw ids in the source file.

This matters more than it looks. Resolution back to a model is **range-based**:
`fromGlobalId` and `getModelForGlobalId` ask which model's id range contains the
number. A raw, unshifted item id from a model loaded at offset 1,000,000 is a
small number, so it lands inside the *primary* model's range: it does not miss
and it does not throw, it resolves to a real entity in the wrong model. Absence
stays absence, though: a mesh with no item id still has none after the shift.

`MeshData.materialId` is **not** re-homed and stays in its model's local space
(tracked in #3525). Do not assume the ids on a mesh are uniformly global; today
`expressId`, `textureRef.textureId` and `geometryItemId` are, and `materialId` is
not.

## Loading Multiple Models

In the viewer, drop multiple IFC files or load them sequentially. Each model appears as a collapsible group in the hierarchy panel.

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { IfcParser } from '@ifc-lite/parser';
import { federationRegistry } from '@ifc-lite/renderer';

const parser = new IfcParser();

// Load first model
const archStore = await parser.parseColumnar(archBuffer);
// Compute maxExpressId from entity index
const archMaxId = Math.max(...archStore.entityIndex.byId.keys());
const archOffset = federationRegistry.registerModel('arch', archMaxId);

// Load second model - IDs start after the first model's range
const structStore = await parser.parseColumnar(structBuffer);
const structMaxId = Math.max(...structStore.entityIndex.byId.keys());
const structOffset = federationRegistry.registerModel('struct', structMaxId);

// Convert IDs
const globalId = federationRegistry.toGlobalId('struct', 42);
const lookup = federationRegistry.fromGlobalId(globalId);
if (lookup) {
  console.log(`Model: ${lookup.modelId}, Express ID: ${lookup.expressId}`);
}
```

## Unified Interactions

When multiple models are loaded:

- **Selection** works across all models - clicking any entity in any model selects it
- **Visibility** can be toggled per-model or per-entity across models
- **Spatial hierarchy** shows all models as top-level groups, expandable to their internal structure
- **Properties panel** shows properties for the selected entity regardless of which model it belongs to
- **Section planes** cut through all visible models simultaneously
- **Measurements** can span across models

## Model Management

The viewer provides controls for each loaded model:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Visibility toggle** | Show/hide an entire model |
| **Collapse/Expand** | Collapse a model's hierarchy tree |
| **Rename** | Give a model a descriptive name |
| **Remove** | Unload a model and free its ID range |
| **Set Active** | Focus the properties panel on a specific model |

## Repositioning models and pointclouds

![Reposition panel aligning an orange diagnostic pointcloud with an Archicad IFC model](../assets/model-reposition.png)

Open **Home → Reposition**, the model's hierarchy action, or the command
palette's Reposition command. IFC models, embedded pointclouds and streamed
scans use the same workspace translation. Either upload order is supported.
Select one or several moving models and choose a fixed reference model.

1. For a large mismatch, use **Frame moving**, **Frame reference** or **Frame
   both** to locate the data. **Move near reference** brings the first selected
   model's bounds centre to the reference centre; it is an approximate preview.
2. Pick a source point on the moving model and a target point on the reference.
   Snapping uses mesh vertices, edges and faces, and actual scan points. The
   highlighted point and live dimensions show the proposed displacement.
3. Refine with X/Y/Z or XY/XZ/YZ constraints, the axis and plane handles, or
   typed values. Numbers accept a decimal dot or comma, scientific notation,
   and `mm`, `cm`, `m`, `km`, `in` and `ft`; bare numbers mean metres. Workspace
   coordinates use engineering axes with Z as elevation.
4. **Move by ΔX / ΔY / ΔZ** enters a displacement from the committed position.
   **Set source point X / Y / Z** sets the picked point's destination in the
   workspace frame. A signed distance follows the constrained axis or current
   move direction. Hold Shift during point picking for orthogonal movement.
   Choose X/Y/Z and use ↑/↓ for the configured nudge increment.
5. **Apply** creates one undo operation for the whole group. Escape or Cancel
   discards the preview. Enter in a numeric field previews its value; Enter
   with focus in the viewport applies. Focused buttons keep their normal keyboard
   activation. **Reset placement** returns selected models to
   their automatically aligned positions. Locks prevent starting new moves;
   undo restores positions without changing subsequent lock settings.

### Rotating a model

**Rotate** turns the selected models about the workspace **vertical axis only**
— the heading change that seats a building on a site. Tilting a model out of
plumb is not offered.

- **Heading** is an absolute angle in degrees, positive counter-clockwise seen
  from above, wrapped to (-180°, 180°]. Re-entering it always turns the model
  once from its original geometry, so an angle can be edited without
  compounding, and `0` restores the model exactly.
- **Pivot X / Y** is the workspace point the axis passes through, in metres —
  one point for every selected model, whatever their translations. It defaults
  to the model's bounds centre and is shown, never implied; elevation does not
  affect a vertical-axis turn. Once a model has a heading it keeps the pivot it
  was given until you change it.
- The rotation is applied to the model **before** the translation above, so the
  pivot is stored in each model's own frame and moves with the model when it is
  moved afterwards. Rotating and then moving is not the same arrangement as
  moving and then rotating.
- Rotating creates one undo entry for the whole selection on the same stack as
  moves, and rides **Undo placement** / **Redo placement** and **Reset
  placement** with them. Locked models refuse to rotate.
- Models with GPU-instanced geometry (repeated elements the viewer draws as
  instances, such as doors, windows or columns) rotate too: the instanced
  occurrences turn about the same axis as the model's flat geometry, from the
  renderer's own instance data. Pointclouds cannot be rotated — they are
  renderer handles that carry a translation but no heading. Models still in
  `pending` or `streaming-geometry` whose kind is not known yet (no geometry,
  no instanced shard, no pointcloud handle) are refused too, until it is. In
  both cases the panel says why, a selection containing one is refused as a
  whole, and a placement manifest that would give such a model a heading is
  not imported.

Unlike a move, a rotation has no drag preview: it rewrites the model's geometry,
which is what keeps rendering, picking, bounds, spatial queries and graphical
exports reading one set of coordinates rather than each applying the angle for
itself. Large models therefore take a moment to turn.

Manual placement composes with automatic georeference alignment. It does not
edit `IfcLocalPlacement`, map conversion, source geometry or scan files.
Re-aligning the federation cancels picked anchors, preserves manual translations
as literal workspace vectors, and re-applies model rotations on top of the new
alignment. The RTC convergence described at the top of this page moves a model
into the shared frame without re-running a rotation: a heading and that
translation commute, so the turned geometry is already correct. What does follow
the model is the **pivot** — it names a workspace point rather than a distance,
so it is re-expressed in the new frame, and the number shown in the panel can
change when a georeferenced model joins the federation. Pointcloud handles
follow the workspace translation but are not rotated. Scaling, CRS conversion
and automatic scan registration are separate operations.

Positions are saved locally by source contents and coordinate frame. Reloading
an unambiguous source restores its committed position; previews are never
saved. Matching reads every source byte using bounded SHA-256 chunks; renaming a file keeps its identity, while changed contents require a new placement. For streamed scans, matching runs after loading completes so it does not delay the first points. Automatic restore and local saving become available once that background pass finishes; moves made meanwhile are preserved and then saved. Removing the scan stops the pass. **Export placements** downloads a versioned JSON manifest. Import
checks units, axes, frame and source identity before applying the entire group.
Repeated copies of one source need explicit instance bindings. Import respects
current locks. Placement is local to this browser workspace and is not shared
with collaboration peers.

Rendering, selection, snapping, bounds, section geometry and graphical exports
use the placed geometry. Existing measurements keep their recorded workspace
points and are labelled **Stale** after movement; remeasure them. Clash and scan
deviation results are invalidated and must be recomputed after applying a move.
Cancelling a preview restores prior measurement validity and analysis results;
a deviation result whose GPU buffers were overwritten during the preview must
be recomputed. Source-model comparison still describes authored changes rather
than registration offsets. STEP IFC exports retain authored coordinates;
graphical GLB and IFC5 geometry
exports include workspace placement. Export the placement manifest alongside
source IFC or scan files when sharing this arrangement. Transformed LAS/E57
writing is not provided.

After a completed deviation run, the Deviation panel's **Export CSV** action
reports minimum, maximum and mean signed distance in metres for each scan asset.
The CSV identifies the scan model when several models are loaded. The renderer's
`readDeviationAssetStats()` method provides the same per-asset values on demand;
it reads GPU deviation buffers only when called and reports no row for a scan
asset added after the run. Recompute before exporting after a model change.

World Context refreshes its Cesium model after movement pauses, using the same
placed geometry. Its previous model stays visible until the replacement is ready;
the WebGPU view updates immediately throughout the move.

Both the 3D cut and the 2D drawing resolve section percentages from the same
placed bounds, including a model moved beyond its original extent.
Construction projection also uses the placed floor elevations. Moving a model
and its section plane together preserves the floor/ceiling projection bands and
the resulting drawing geometry, for either section direction. Floor bands
refresh when the model moves or its storey membership changes; no reload is
needed. See [2D drawings after repositioning](drawing-2d.md#drawings-after-repositioning).

![A real Archicad IFC section after moving the model up 100 metres](../assets/model-reposition-section.png)

Large translations and their subsequent fine corrections are retained in double
precision. Mesh and scan vertices stay near their own decode/draw origins;
manual correction is composed before GPU narrowing. Precision still depends on
the source data, a scan's spatial extent and the final distance from the render
origin. Bring distant data near the reference before millimetre adjustment;
repositioning cannot recover detail already rounded in the source file.

## Merging to a Single File (CLI)

In-viewer federation keeps each model as a separate file with an ID offset. When
you instead want to bake several models into one physical IFC file, use the
`ifc-lite merge` command:

```bash
ifc-lite merge a.ifc b.ifc --out fed.ifc
```

Pass two or more input files (positional args) and one `--out` target. The
spatial hierarchy (sites, buildings, storeys) is unified by name and elevation by
default so the merged file has one coherent tree rather than duplicated
containers.

| Flag | Values | Default | Effect |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| `--out <file>` | path | required | Output file path |
| `--schema` | `IFC2X3` / `IFC4` / `IFC4X3` | `IFC4` | Output schema version |
| `--unit-reconciliation` | `auto` / `normalize` / `assume-shared` | `auto` | How to handle models whose length unit differs from the first file. `auto` federates them as separate projects; `normalize` rescales them into the first file's unit; `assume-shared` forces one project without rescaling |
| `--merge-sites` | `single` / `by-name` | combined heuristic | How `IfcSite` records are matched across models |
| `--merge-buildings` | `single` / `by-name` | combined heuristic | How `IfcBuilding` records are matched |
| `--merge-storeys` | `by-name` / `by-elevation` / `by-name-then-elevation` | combined heuristic | How `IfcBuildingStorey` records are matched |
| `--drop-empty-containers` | flag | off | Leave out sites, buildings, storeys and spaces the merged model leaves holding nothing (the "Merge Projects" recipe step matching alone does not cover) |
| `--json` | flag | off | Emit machine-readable stats (entity counts, warnings) to stdout |

## FederatedModel Type

Each loaded model is tracked as a `FederatedModel`:

```typescript
interface FederatedModel {
  id: string;            // Unique model identifier
  name: string;          // Display name
  idOffset: number;      // Global ID offset
  maxExpressId: number;  // Highest expressId in this model
  visible: boolean;      // Visibility state
  collapsed: boolean;    // Hierarchy tree state
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Each model adds its entities to the shared spatial index and renderer
- Memory usage scales linearly with total entity count across all models
- The FederationRegistry resolves IDs in O(1) local->global, O(log N) global->local
- Visibility toggling per-model is O(1) (GPU-level filtering)
- Loading 5+ large models (100MB+ each) may require the server paradigm for best performance

## IFC5 Federated Layers

For IFC5 (IFCX) files, federation works differently - files can be loaded as **overlay layers** where later files override properties from earlier ones:

```typescript
import { parseFederatedIfcx } from '@ifc-lite/ifcx';

const result = await parseFederatedIfcx([
  { buffer: baseBuffer, name: 'base-model.ifcx' },
  { buffer: overlayBuffer, name: 'add-fire-rating.ifcx' },
]);

// Properties from the overlay take precedence
// Wall now has FireRating property from the overlay file
```

See the [IFC5 Parsing Guide](parsing.md) for more details on IFCX format support.
