# Lists and Schedules

IFClite can turn model data into configurable property tables, the BIM equivalent of door schedules and wall schedules. The `@ifc-lite/lists` package evaluates a list definition against parsed model data and produces rows you can display, group, summarise, or export as CSV.

## How It Works

A **list definition** describes what to tabulate:

- **Entity types** - Which IFC classes to include (e.g. all `IfcDoor`)
- **Columns** - Which values to pull for each entity (attributes, properties, quantities, ...)
- **Filter groups** - Optional shared Rules predicates, evaluated by the viewer before column extraction

`executeList` runs a definition with empty filter groups against a **data provider** (an adapter over your parsed model) and returns a `ListResult` with one row per matching entity. See [migrating saved v1 conditions](#migrating-saved-v1-conditions) for Rules-backed definitions.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { executeList, listResultToCSV, LIST_PRESETS } from '@ifc-lite/lists';
import type { ListDataProvider } from '@ifc-lite/lists';

// LIST_PRESETS[0] is the Wall Schedule
const result = executeList(LIST_PRESETS[0], provider);

console.log(`${result.rows.length} walls`);

// Export as CSV
const csv = listResultToCSV(result);
```

`executeList(definition, provider, modelId?)` takes an optional third argument tagging rows with a model id (defaults to `'default'`), useful when running the same list across multiple loaded models.

## Column Sources

Each `ColumnDefinition` has a `source` that says where the value comes from:

| Source | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `attribute` | Direct IFC attribute | `Name`, `GlobalId`, `ObjectType`, `Class` |
| `property` | Property from a pset | `Pset_WallCommon.FireRating` |
| `quantity` | Quantity from a qset | `Qto_WallBaseQuantities.NetSideArea` |
| `material` | Associated material names (joined with `", "`) | `Concrete, Insulation` |
| `classification` | Classification references (joined with `", "`) | `Uniclass Ss_25_10` |
| `spatial` | Containing spatial element name; `propertyName` picks the level (`Storey` (default), `Building`, `Site`, `Project`) | `Level 2` |
| `model` | Source file name | `office.ifc` |
| `zone` | Location-zone assignment and per-zone volume (user-defined 3D zone boxes, viewer-computed); `psetName` holds the zone-set id, `propertyName` picks the mode — see [Zone columns](#zone-columns) | `Section A` |

A column looks like:

```typescript
import type { ColumnDefinition } from '@ifc-lite/lists';

const fireRating: ColumnDefinition = {
  id: 'prop-pset_doorcommon-firerating',
  source: 'property',
  psetName: 'Pset_DoorCommon',
  propertyName: 'FireRating',
  label: 'FireRating',
};
```

For `quantity` columns, `psetName` holds the quantity set name (e.g. `Qto_DoorBaseQuantities`).

### Zone columns

`psetName` holds the **zone-set id** (durable; the set's display name is not unique). `propertyName` is the mode:

| Mode | Cell | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `Zone` (default) | Zone name | A straddling element shows every touched zone, joined with `", "`. |
| `Straddles` | Boolean | Whether the element crosses a zone boundary. |
| `volume (mesh)` | Number | The element's volume inside its HOME zone. Exported as `ZONE_MODE_VOLUME`. |
| `volume breakdown (mesh)` | Text | Every zone with a share, as `Zone A: 1.2, Zone B: 0.8`. Exported as `ZONE_MODE_BREAKDOWN`. |

Three things about the volume modes are load-bearing:

- **The basis is in the mode name.** `mesh` is the as-built geometry, *after* opening cuts — the only basis whose per-zone split is measured rather than inferred. It is not a `NetVolume` and not a `GrossVolume`; a zone volume derived from a net wall and one derived from a gross wall are not comparable, so the label travels with the number rather than living in a tooltip. The declared net/gross breakdowns are shown side by side in the viewer's properties panel, where there is room for all of them.
- **They are `null` until someone asks.** Apportionment is an explicit on-demand action, never part of model load, so adding the column never triggers a model-wide clip. A cell is also `null` when the element does not straddle, or when its mesh is not a proven closed solid — in which case no volume may be stated for it at all, let alone split.
- **The unit is the model's declared volume unit.** A `volume (mesh)` column is tagged with `QuantityType.Volume`, so the shared per-column unit resolver converts and labels it exactly like a declared `NetVolume`. Use `isZoneVolumeMode(mode)` rather than comparing strings if you need to make the same decision.

```typescript
import { ZONE_MODE_VOLUME, type ColumnDefinition } from '@ifc-lite/lists';

// `psetName` is the durable zone-set id, not the set's display name.
const zoneSetId = 'a3f1c0de-...';

const zoneVolume: ColumnDefinition = {
  id: 'zone-volume',
  source: 'zone',
  psetName: zoneSetId,
  propertyName: ZONE_MODE_VOLUME,
  label: 'Volume in zone',
};
```

A provider supplies the numbers through one optional method on `ListDataProvider`:

```typescript
import type { ListDataProvider } from '@ifc-lite/lists';

type ZoneVolumeShares = NonNullable<ListDataProvider['getZoneVolumeShares']>;
//   (expressId: number, zoneSetId: string) => {
//     homeValue: number | null;
//     shares: Array<{ zoneName: string; value: number }>;
//   } | null
```

## Built-in Presets

`LIST_PRESETS` is an array of ready-made `ListDefinition`s:

| Preset | Entity types | Columns |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Wall Schedule** | IfcWall, IfcWallStandardCase | Common properties and base quantities |
| **Door Schedule** | IfcDoor | FireRating, IsExternal, AcousticRating, Width, Height, Area |
| **Window Schedule** | IfcWindow | Dimensions |
| **Space Areas** | IfcSpace | Areas and volumes |
| **Zones & Systems** | IfcSpatialZone, IfcZone, IfcSystem, IfcDistributionSystem | Names |
| **All Elements** | Walls, doors, windows, slabs, columns, beams, stairs, roofs, coverings, curtain walls, railings | Overview columns |

## Worked Example: Door Schedule to CSV

```typescript
import { executeList, listResultToCSV, LIST_PRESETS } from '@ifc-lite/lists';

// LIST_PRESETS[1] is the Door Schedule:
//   Name, Class, ObjectType,
//   Pset_DoorCommon.FireRating / IsExternal / AcousticRating,
//   Qto_DoorBaseQuantities.Width / Height / Area
const doorSchedule = LIST_PRESETS[1];

const result = executeList(doorSchedule, provider, 'office.ifc');

for (const row of result.rows) {
  console.log(row.values);
}

const csv = listResultToCSV(result);
// listResultToCSV(result, delimiter?) - default delimiter is ','
```

### CSV Safety

`listResultToCSV` guards against spreadsheet formula injection (CWE-1236): a cell that starts with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, or carriage return is prefixed with a single quote so Excel and Google Sheets treat it as text rather than a formula. The trigger is looked for past any leading invisible characters, so a zero-width space in front of `=` does not slip through.

One exception, deliberate: a cell that is **wholly** a number (`-0.35`, `+1`, `-1.5e-3`) is left alone, so a column of negative measures still sums in a spreadsheet. Such a cell cannot carry a formula, since the accepted characters are only `+ - . e E` and the digits. Anything with a trigger and a non-numeric tail (`-0.35=cmd`) is still prefixed. The consequence to know about is that a numeric-looking *identifier* held as text — a `+`-prefixed phone number, a zero-padded code like `-007` — is now written as a number rather than preserved as text.

Standard CSV quoting (double quotes, `""` escaping) is applied on top.

## Grouping, Aggregation & Schedules

Set `grouping` on a `ListDefinition` to bucket rows by one or more columns (outermost first) and sum numeric columns per group:

```typescript
import { executeList, summariseListRows, toScheduleRows, LIST_PRESETS } from '@ifc-lite/lists';

const definition = {
  ...LIST_PRESETS[0], // Wall Schedule
  grouping: {
    columnId: 'attr-name',       // legacy single-column field, kept in sync with columnIds[0]
    columnIds: ['attr-name'],    // ordered group-by columns, outermost first
    sumColumnIds: ['quant-qto_wallbasequantities-length'],
  },
};

const result = executeList(definition, provider);

// result.groups is a flat PRE-ORDER list: each parent group is immediately
// followed by its subgroups. Every group carries a Count aggregate (`count`)
// and per-column sums (`sums`).
for (const group of result.groups ?? []) {
  console.log(group.label, group.count, group.sums);
}

// A Bonsai-style schedule/pivot table — one row per group-value tuple (the
// LEAF groups only) instead of a nested tree. `levelCount` must be the number
// of grouping columns that were ACTUALLY applied: the engine drops grouping
// ids whose column is no longer in the definition (a stale persisted grouping
// is the common case), so passing the raw `columnIds.length` can ask for a
// deeper leaf level than the groups have — and `toScheduleRows` then matches
// nothing and returns no rows.
const activeGroupIds = definition.grouping.columnIds.filter(
  (id) => definition.columns.some((c) => c.id === id),
);
const scheduleRows = toScheduleRows(result.groups, activeGroupIds.length);
for (const row of scheduleRows) {
  console.log(row.path, row.count, row.sums); // e.g. ["Wall-01"], 1, { ... }
}
```

`summariseListRows(definition, rows)` is what `executeList` calls internally to build `groups`/`summary`; call it directly when you already have rows from elsewhere (e.g. merged across federated models) and just need to re-derive the grouping.

## Lists in documents

A list can be printed inside a [document](./documents.md): **Analyze → Document → Add block → Table (from a list)** takes a copy of a saved list or a preset and prints it the way the list's own export does — unit-converted cells, group rows with count and sums or the schedule view, a totals row when something is summed — re-running it on the loaded models whenever the document is shown or printed. The block's *Edit in Lists* opens the copy in the Lists panel; saving there and *Update from saved list* on the block brings the edit back. A copy never carries a search-selection snapshot (`expressIdsByModel`), which is bound to one load of one model.

## The Data Provider

`executeList` reads model data through the `ListDataProvider` interface, so the package has no hard dependency on how you parsed the model. Required methods include `getEntitiesByType`, `getEntityName`, `getEntityGlobalId`, `getPropertySets`, and `getQuantitySets`; optional methods (`getMaterialNames`, `getClassifications`, `getStoreyName`, `getProjectName`, `getZoneAssignment`, `getZoneSetNames`, `getZoneVolumeShares`, ...) unlock the `material`, `classification`, `spatial`, `model`, and `zone` column sources, and the engine degrades gracefully when they are absent (a `zone` column simply resolves to `null` on a provider without zone data). The two volume modes go through `getZoneVolumeShares` specifically, so a provider that implements `getZoneAssignment` but not `getZoneVolumeShares` still answers `Zone` and `Straddles` and returns `null` for the volumes.

## Discovering Columns

To build a column picker UI (or just see what a model contains), use `discoverColumns`:

```typescript
import { discoverColumns } from '@ifc-lite/lists';
import { IfcTypeEnum } from '@ifc-lite/data';

// Accepts one provider or an array of providers
const discovered = discoverColumns(provider, [IfcTypeEnum.IfcDoor]);

discovered.attributes;  // available entity attributes
discovered.properties;  // Map<psetName, propertyNames[]>
discovered.quantities;  // Map<qsetName, quantityNames[]>
```

It samples up to 50 entities per type per provider, so it stays fast on large models.

## Name Patterns

Conditions and lookups that match by name accept either an exact string or a regex literal. `compileNameMatcher(pattern)` returns a `(name: string) => boolean`:

- `/fire.*rating/i` - a `/body/flags` string compiles to a regular expression
- anything else - exact, case-sensitive match

`isNamePattern(pattern)` tells you whether a string will be treated as a regex.

## Migrating saved v1 conditions

`migrateLegacyListDefinition(definition)` converts a saved v1 definition's flat
`conditions`, and the provider-only rows lists saved before #6190, into
`groups: FilterGroup[]` before the viewer runs it. A plain property comparison
becomes a `property` rule; every other predicate becomes a `listCondition`
rule (see below), so no saved predicate changes the rows it keeps. Flat
conditions narrow every group: they are ANDed into each one, and an OR group is
split into one AND group per rule. The conversion is idempotent.

Only data no build can evaluate stays in `unreadableConditions`: a malformed
member, an unknown operator or source, or a saved rule this build does not
know. A saved list is not hidden because of one; the viewer shows each row
with a warning and a Remove button, and the list cannot run until they are
gone. `migrateLegacyListConditions(conditions)` exposes the pure condition
conversion for other v1 importers.

`executeList` is the synchronous provider-only source and column engine. First
evaluate any Rules groups, then pass an execution copy such as
`{ ...definition, groups: [], expressIdsByModel: filteredIdsByModel }`.
Passing the original definition with nonempty groups throws, even when it has
an `expressIdsByModel` snapshot, to avoid silently returning extra rows.

## Lists predicates inside Rules groups

A Lists value predicate with no canonical Rules equivalent (zone assignment and
zone volume modes, exact Container/Storey/Building/Site/Project levels,
quantity and material presence, the model file name, the Lists attributes such
as `Class`, `Type` and `GlobalId`, and properties inherited through
aggregation) can sit in a `FilterGroup` as a `listCondition` rule. Its fields
are the saved condition, verbatim, and the Lists engine answers it, so it keeps
the same rows it keeps as a list scope while composing with other rules under
AND or OR. Give each evaluated model the provider's matcher:

```ts
import { listConditionMatcher, type ListDataProvider } from '@ifc-lite/lists';
import { Rule, evaluateFilterGroupsFederated } from '@ifc-lite/rules';
import type { IfcDataStore } from '@ifc-lite/parser';

declare const store: IfcDataStore;
declare const provider: ListDataProvider;

const straddlers = await evaluateFilterGroupsFederated(
  [{ id: 'm1', store, listConditions: listConditionMatcher(provider) }],
  [{ combinator: 'OR', rules: [
    Rule.listCondition({ source: 'zone', psetName: 'zone-set-id', propertyName: 'Straddles', operator: 'equals', value: 'true' }),
    Rule.name('eq', 'Core wall'),
  ] }],
);
```
