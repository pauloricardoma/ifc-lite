/**
 * Per-split generation SALT for the World Gym Benchmark (B4.3).
 *
 * WHY. The benchmark's model universe is a pure function of the seed, and its
 * splits are seed arithmetic over a public range, so hosting the model bytes
 * withholds nothing: an adversary regenerates both the corrupted model and its
 * CLEAN TWIN locally and diffs them (`benchmark/attacks/clean-twin-diff.mjs`,
 * an exact 1.000 aggregate through the real scorer). The only thing that
 * changes that is a SECRET THAT ENTERS GENERATION. This module is that secret's
 * plumbing: `Rng` takes a salt, every stream in the generation path takes the
 * same salt, and without it neither the twin nor the corrupted model is
 * computable. BENCHMARK.md section 1a is normative; section 1b is the lifecycle
 * and rotation procedure.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT JUST A STRING CONCATENATION ONTO THE EXISTING SEED. That was
 * the obvious implementation and it does not work. The unsalted stream is
 * `mulberry32(FNV-1a(key))`: 32 bits of hashed key, 32 bits of state. Whatever
 * you concatenate into the key, the stream the generator actually consumes is
 * one of 2^32 streams, and the served bytes are a cheap oracle for testing a
 * candidate - the drawn parameters show up as dimensions in the file, and the
 * GlobalIds are a literal readout of the `guid:` stream. An attacker who never
 * learns the salt can therefore sweep 2^32 candidate stream states per seed,
 * confirm against the bytes they were served, recover the parameters, rebuild
 * the clean twin exactly and rerun the twin diff. See
 * `scripts/moonshot/b43-benchmark-salt/` for the measured cost of that sweep.
 * So the salted path is KEYED rather than hashed: HMAC-SHA256(salt, streamKey)
 * expanded into a 128-bit sfc32 state (`lib/rng.mjs`). The unsalted path is
 * left byte-for-byte alone, because the whole committed corpus depends on it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO. It does not decide WHICH split is salted (that
 * is `benchmark/splits.mjs#saltForSplit`, and the answer is: the reporting
 * split only - dev stays open and attackable by design), and it does not
 * deliver the salt to submitters. Delivery needs the hosted scorer, which does
 * not exist; the salt is nevertheless a complete and testable mechanism without
 * it, which is what B4.3's exam measures.
 *
 * HANDLING RULES, because a salt that leaks is worse than no salt (it looks
 * like protection and is not, silently and retroactively - BENCHMARK.md 1b):
 *   - a salt NEVER enters argv. `resolveSaltFromArgs` below refuses `--salt
 *     <value>` outright and takes `--salt-env VAR` or `--salt-file PATH`.
 *   - no error, log line or artifact in this tree prints a salt value. They
 *     print `saltFingerprint()` instead, and the CLI error paths run
 *     `redactSalt()` over anything they are about to write.
 *   - a salt is VALIDATED at every boundary it crosses, because a weak salt is
 *     the same failure shape as a check that cannot fail. See `normalizeSalt`
 *     (the universal floor) and `assertSecretSaltFormat` (the deployment
 *     format).

 *
 * Two tiers, because the two populations are genuinely different:
 *
 * 1. UNIVERSAL FLOOR (`normalizeSalt`, applied to every salt anywhere,
 *    including the published exam salts of scripts/moonshot/b43-benchmark-salt):
 *    printable ASCII with no whitespace, and it must carry a contiguous run of
 *    at least MIN_HEX_RUN lowercase hex characters - 128 bits of
 *    machine-generated material. A human-readable label around that run is
 *    fine (`b43-exam-salt-A-<32 hex>`); a salt made only of words is not.
 * 2. DEPLOYMENT FORMAT (`assertSecretSaltFormat`, applied where a real secret
 *    enters: `saltForSplit` reading WORLD_GYM_SALT_TEST): exactly 64 lowercase
 *    hex characters, i.e. the output of SALT_GEN_COMMAND and nothing else.
 *    This is the tier that catches the specific catastrophe tier 1 cannot -
 *    someone pasting a PUBLISHED exam salt into a production scorer.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: this is a shape check, not an entropy oracle. It catches the
 * misconfiguration that actually happens (a memorable phrase, a repeated
 * character, a truncated paste) and cannot catch someone who deliberately types
 * 64 hex characters out of their head. The guarantee that the material is
 * random is procedural - mint it with SALT_GEN_COMMAND - and the check is what
 * makes a deviation from that procedure visible.
