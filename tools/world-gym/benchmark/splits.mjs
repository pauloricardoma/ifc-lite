/**
 * World Gym Benchmark - versioned split arithmetic (see BENCHMARK.md).
 *
 * Everything about the benchmark's model universe is a pure function of the
 * seed plus the constants in this file. There is no seed list to download:
 * splits are DEFINED by seed arithmetic (`seed % 10`), and every model plus
 * its full ground truth is regenerable from its seed via
 * `../generator.mjs#generateModel(seed, 'auto', { corruptRate: CORRUPT_RATE })`.
 * That is a deliberate design decision: test-split labels are never
 * distributed as data, because distributing them is pointless when anyone
 * with this repo can regenerate them.
 *
 * v1.1 WITHDREW the "hidden-by-hosting" integrity story this file used to
 * assert. It was false, and the two lines above are the reason: if splits are
 * defined by arithmetic over a public seed universe and the generator takes no
 * secret, then hosting the bytes withholds nothing -- the attacker regenerates
 * both the corrupted model and its clean twin locally and diffs them
 * (`attacks/clean-twin-diff.mjs`, an exact 1.000 aggregate through the real
 * scorer). The reporting split's integrity model is
 * hidden-by-secret-salt-delivered-by-hosting.
 *
 * v1.2 IMPLEMENTS THE SALT HALF (B4.3). `generateModel` now takes a secret that
 * enters every RNG stream, `saltForSplit` below decides which split gets one,
 * and the scorer threads it through ground-truth regeneration. The DELIVERY
 * half is still missing: no hosted scorer exists, so no salt is configured in
 * any deployment and `saltForSplit` returns the unsalted universe everywhere by
 * default. Read that precisely - the mechanism is implemented and measured
 * (scripts/moonshot/b43-benchmark-salt/), the trust model is not yet in force.
 * See BENCHMARK.md section 1a (normative for the claim) and 1b (the salt's
 * lifecycle and rotation); do not restate either here.
 *
 * Bump SPEC_VERSION whenever any of: the constants below, the generator's
 * byte output for any in-universe seed, the task set, or the scoring math
 * changes. Leaderboard rows embed the version; rows from different versions
 * are not comparable.

/**

 * Two invariants, both load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. NON-REPORTING SPLITS ARE NEVER SALTED, whatever the environment says. Not
 *    a policy default - a hard return. If salting dev were reachable by setting
 *    a variable, "dev is open" would be a claim about a deployment rather than
 *    about the code, and nobody could check it.
 * 2. THE DEFAULT IS UNSALTED. With no variable set - which is every checkout
 *    and every CI run today - the reporting split is the same public universe
 *    it always was, and the committed anchors stay valid. Configuring the
 *    variable is the deliberate act of standing up a salted universe.
 *
 * 3. A CONFIGURED SALT MUST BE THE DOCUMENTED FORMAT. This is the boundary a
 *    real deployment secret crosses, so it is where the format is enforced:
 *    exactly 64 lowercase hex characters, i.e. 32 CSPRNG bytes. A weak or
 *    hand-chosen salt silently produces a weak split, which looks exactly like
 *    protection and is not - so it is a refusal (`SaltFormatError`), not a
 *    warning. See lib/salt.mjs for the two validation tiers and their reasons.
 *
 * @param {string} split
 * @param {Record<string, string|undefined>} [env]
 * @returns {string} '' (unsalted) or the configured salt
 * @throws {SaltFormatError} if the reporting split's salt is set but malformed
