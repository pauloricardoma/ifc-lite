/**
 * Determinism proof for the World Gym generator.
 *
 * For each of N seeds, generates the model twice - with a real wall-clock
 * delay between the two generations, so a naive implementation that leaks
 * Date.now()/crypto.randomUUID() would be caught - and asserts the two IFC
 * files are byte-identical (compared by SHA-256, not just length).
 *
 * It also asserts the B4.3 salt invariants over the same seeds: a salt changes
 * the bytes, a salted generation is still deterministic, two salts disagree,
 * and no non-reporting split can be salted whatever the environment says.
 *
 * And it asserts the salt HANDLING invariants, which are security properties
 * rather than determinism ones and are otherwise only claimed in prose: a salt
 * is never accepted from argv, a weak or misformatted salt is refused at every
 * boundary, and no refusal message contains the material it refused.
 *
 * Usage: node determinism-check.mjs [--seeds 20] [--delay-ms 50]
