# World Gym - procedural building generator + deterministic labeler + benchmark

M2 (docs/vision/moonshots-execution-plan.md): a procedural generator +
deterministic labeling pipeline over `packages/create`, now at the M2
midterm bar - **100k generated models, 100% labeled, mixed positive and
negative label classes, labels spot-validated against the IfcOpenShell
differential oracle, five discriminative reward channels behind one env
API** - plus, since B2.2, a **versioned public benchmark**
(`benchmark/BENCHMARK.md`): three scored tasks over a 10k-seed universe with
deterministic train/dev/test splits, a submission validator + scoring
harness, three committed reference baselines, and benchmark episodes served
through `ifc-lite gym --seed <n>`.

Every sample gets perfect ground-truth labels because the labels are either
the exact numbers used to author the geometry (not re-derived from the
file), the exact defects planted by the corruption layer (recorded at plant
time, independent of any checker), or the output of actually running the
kernel's own checks on the serialized bytes.

## Quick start

```bash
# One model, standalone
node generator.mjs --seed 42 --family frame --out /tmp/model.ifc --json

# One adversarial model with known-by-construction defects
node generator.mjs --seed 42 --corrupt --out /tmp/bad.ifc --json

# One model, generated + labeled in-process (writes the file, prints one JSONL line)
node labeler.mjs --seed 42 --family frame --model-dir /tmp/world-gym

# Determinism proof over 20 seeds
node determinism-check.mjs --seeds 20

# A corpus run (output MUST go outside the repo). 30% adversarial, no .ifc
# files kept (every model is reproducible from its seed; the manifest is
# the deliverable):
node run-pilot.mjs --count 100000 --out-dir /path/outside/repo/wg-100k \
  --corrupt-rate 0.3 --no-keep-files --workers 10

# Reward-channel discrimination report over a labeled corpus
node channel-report.mjs --manifest /path/wg-100k/manifest.jsonl --out channels-report.json

# IfcOpenShell differential oracle spot-validation (needs a python with
# ifcopenshell==0.8.5, the same pin as tools/ifcopenshell_reference)
node oracle-validate.mjs --manifest /path/wg-100k/manifest.jsonl \
  --python /path/to/venv/bin/python --every 500
```

## Benchmark quickstart (B2.2)

The benchmark is seeds 0..9999 at corrupt rate 0.3, split by seed
arithmetic: train `seed % 10 <= 7` (8,000), dev `seed % 10 == 8` (1,000),
test `seed % 10 == 9` (1,000). Three tasks, each scored 0-1: defect
detection (macro-F1 over the 7 planted defect types), quantity estimation
(1 - relative error vs the authoring-time kernel quantities), validity
triage (concordance of a severity ranking); aggregate = unweighted mean.
`benchmark/BENCHMARK.md` is the normative spec.

```bash
# Regenerate any benchmark model (same call the episode server makes)
node generator.mjs --seed 4218 --corrupt-rate 0.3 --out /tmp/m.ifc

# Validate a submission (JSONL: header line + one prediction line per seed)
node benchmark/score.mjs --submission sub.jsonl --split dev --validate-only

# Score it: regenerates the split's ground truth from seeds (~1s for dev),
# emits a deterministic leaderboard-row JSON
node benchmark/score.mjs --submission sub.jsonl --split dev --out row.json

# Re-run the three reference baselines (submissions land outside the repo,
# rows + split summary in benchmark/results/)
node benchmark/baselines.mjs --split dev --out-dir /path/outside/repo/wg-bench

# Serve benchmark episodes over the gym protocol (RL-style consumers);
# mid-session {"type":"reset","seed":N} swaps episodes
node ../../packages/cli/dist/index.js gym --seed 42 --checks schema,clash
```

Submission how-to, in three steps: (1) for every seed of your split,
obtain the model (regenerate locally, or stream episodes via `ifc-lite gym
--seed N`) and produce per-model predictions; (2) write the JSONL file -
header `{"type":"header","benchmark":"ifc-lite-world-gym","specVersion":
"1.2.0","split":"dev","name":"<your-method>","tasks":[...]}` then one
`{"seed":8,"defects":{...},"quantities":{...},"triage":0.7}` line per seed;
(3) run `score.mjs` as above. The only rule that matters locally: reading
`generateModel(...).defects`/`labels` for an evaluated seed is reading the
answer key (see BENCHMARK.md rules). Dev-split anchor rows to beat are in
`benchmark/results/leaderboard-dev.json`. Those committed rows carry
`specVersion` `1.0.0` and stay that way: the field records the version a row
was scored under, and that run happened under v1.0. They are still the right
anchors for an unsalted 1.2.0 row, because neither v1.1 nor v1.2 changed a
constant, a generator byte (with no salt configured, which is every checkout),
a task or the scoring math - only what the spec claims a *test* row is worth
(BENCHMARK.md version note and section 1a). Your own header must say `1.2.0`;
the validator rejects any other value.

`--family` accepts `frame`, `office`, or `auto` (default - the seed itself
picks the family, so `--seed N` alone still determines one specific building
end to end).

`generateModel()` is the single source of truth. It:

1. Derives a family choice (`{seed}:family` sub-stream), a parameter draw
   (`{seed}:params:{family}` sub-stream), and a corruption decision + defect
   plan (`{seed}:corrupt` sub-stream) from independent RNG streams keyed off
   the seed. If a SALT is supplied, every one of those streams - and the
   GlobalId stream in step 4 - is keyed by it instead, so the seed alone no
   longer determines the model. Omitting the salt is the default and is
   byte-identical to the unsalted corpus. Only the benchmark's reporting split
   is ever salted, and only when a scorer is configured with one; see
   `benchmark/BENCHMARK.md` sections 1a and 1b. A salt is only ever accepted
   from `--salt-env <VAR>` or `--salt-file <PATH>` - never from `--salt
   <value>`, which is refused, because argv is world-readable - and it is
   format-validated at every boundary it crosses.
2. Builds the model into one `IfcCreator` instance using the exact same
   `@ifc-lite/create` methods the CLI's `ifc-lite create` command calls -
   metres, identity placement, one `toIfc()` call, per house convention.
3. If the seed is corrupted: applies build-time defects (overlapping footing
   pairs, zero-height columns) before `toIfc()` and text-level defects
   (GUID duplication, deleted IfcSite, duplicated IfcProject, dangling ref,
   deleted quantity bindings) after it - all drawn from the seed, all
   recorded as ground truth at plant time.
4. Pins the build to the seed via `IfcCreator`'s `Timestamp` + `GuidSource`
   params (`deterministicCreateParams(seed, salt)` from
   `lib/deterministic-create.mjs`).

## Family parameter spaces

### Family A - `frame` (rectangular multi-storey slab-and-column frame)

Perimeter walls with generic rectangular openings cut (never filled by a
door/window) ring every storey; a column grid sits at every bay
intersection; beams tie the grid together at the top of each storey; a slab
floors every level plus one roof slab on top.

| Parameter | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `storeys` | 1-4 (int) | |
| `storeyHeight` | 2.7-3.9 m | |
| `baysX`, `baysY` | 2-4, 2-3 (int) | grid bay counts |
| `spanX`, `spanY` | 3.0-7.5 m, 3.0-6.5 m | bay spans |
| `wallThickness` | 0.15-0.30 m | |
| `slabThickness` | 0.18-0.32 m | |
| `columnSize` | 0.25-0.45 m | square cross-section |
| `beamWidth` / `beamHeight` | 0.2-0.35 m / 0.3-0.5 m | |
| `openingsPerLongWall` | 0-3 (int) | cut into the two longer perimeter walls only |
| `openingWidth` / `openingHeight` / `sillHeight` | 1.0-1.8 / 1.2-1.8 / 0.8-1.0 m | |

### Family B - `office` (single-storey partitioned office slab)

One floor slab, a perimeter wall ring, and a lattice of partition walls
carving the footprint into a `rows x cols` grid of rooms, each captured as an
`IfcSpace`.

| Parameter | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rows`, `cols` | 2-4, 2-5 (int) | room grid |
| `roomSpanX`, `roomSpanY` | 3.0-6.0 m, 3.0-5.5 m | |
| `wallHeight` | 2.7-3.6 m | |
| `perimeterThickness` / `partitionThickness` | 0.2-0.35 / 0.1-0.15 m | |
| `slabThickness` | 0.15-0.30 m | |

Room footprints use the grid centerline, not partition-half-thickness
subtraction - a documented v1 approximation, good enough for reward-channel
ground truth.

### Adversarial mode (negative-label corpus half)

`--corrupt-rate p` corrupts a deterministic Bernoulli(p) subset of seeds
(`--corrupt` forces one model). Each corrupted model carries 1-3 distinct
defect types drawn from the `{seed}:corrupt` stream:

| Defect | Mechanism | Detected by |
|---|---|---|
| `clash-pair` | 1-3 pairs of overlapping `IfcFooting` at isolated positions, penetration 0.3-0.7 m, known pair names | clash engine (footing self-clash rule) |
| `degenerate-geometry` | 1-2 zero-height `IfcColumn` (extrusion depth 0) | geometry pipeline emits no mesh for them |
| `duplicate-globalid` | second wall's GlobalId overwritten with the first's | `validate` unique-globalid (error) |
| `missing-site` | `IFCSITE` line deleted (leaves a dangling aggregate ref too) | `validate` required-entity (error) |
| `multiple-project` | `IFCPROJECT` line duplicated under a fresh express id | `validate` single-project (error) |
| `dangling-ref` | one containment ref rewritten to `#99999999` | **nothing today** - see Known gaps |
| `missing-quantities` | 1-3 quantity-binding rel lines deleted | `validate` quantity-completeness + quantity re-extraction |

Ground truth for every planted defect is recorded in the manifest
(`defects` = what was planted, `expected` = what a correct checker must
observe) at plant time, independent of the labeler - so the labeler is
*validated against the plants*, never against itself. The 100k run's
`groundTruthAgreement` was 100,000/100,000 (`allMatchRate: 1`).

Corruption is exactly as deterministic as generation: same seed in, same
defects, same bytes out (verified byte-identical across repeated runs; the
Bernoulli roll is always burned before the plan draw so `--corrupt-rate`
corpora and `forceCorrupt` regeneration produce identical bytes).

## Label sources ("perfect ground truth", three kinds)

1. **Generation-parameter ground truth (free, exact, cannot drift).**
   `entityCountsByType` from `IfcCreator`'s own bookkeeping; storey count
   and every quantity from the family module's `build()` return value
   (`lib/quantities.mjs` computes each element's numbers once, feeds both
   the STEP output and the label).
2. **Planted-defect ground truth** (corrupted models): defect records and
   derived expectations written by the corruption layer at plant time.
3. **Checks that run the pipeline on the serialized bytes** - schema
   verdict, clash detection, and an independent quantity re-extraction.
   Since v2 these run in-process (`lib/checks.mjs`) via the exact functions
   `ifc-lite validate` / `ifc-lite clash` call (`computeValidationIssues`,
   `GeometryProcessor` + `elementsFromStep` + `createClashEngine`), with one
   warm WASM processor per worker. The v1 subprocess path is retained
   behind `--engine subprocess` for A/B measurement.

## Reward channels (the single env API)

`lib/reward-channels.mjs#computeRewardChannels(manifestLine, opts)` - one
manifest line in, five scalars in [0, 1] out:

| Channel | Definition | 100k distribution (clean / corrupted mean) |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaValidity` | 1 valid no warnings, 0.5 valid with warnings, 0 invalid | 1.0 / ~0.33 |
| `clashScore` | `1 / (1 + detected clashes)` | 1.0 / ~0.82 |
| `determinismHashMatch` | candidate sha256 == manifest sha256 (no candidate = regenerate from seed) | 1.0 self-eval; 0 on every tampered candidate |
| `quantityAccuracy` | 1 - mean relative error, re-extracted totals vs ground truth | 1.0 / <1 when quantities were removed |
| `defectDetection` | planted defect types detected / planted (clean: 1 unless phantom detection) | 1.0 / <1 (dangling-ref is invisible - real gap, surfaced not hidden) |

`channel-report.mjs` proves discrimination over a corpus: per-channel value
histograms split clean/corrupted, a regenerate-and-rehash determinism
re-proof over a deterministic 10% slice, and a tamper probe (one flipped
byte must drop `determinismHashMatch` to 0). On the 100k corpus every
channel is non-constant across classes and the tamper probe was 100/100.

Relationship to `ifc-lite gym` (B0.4 -> B2.2): `packages/cli/src/commands/
gym.ts` is a reset/step/reward loop with schema/clash/ids channels, and
since B2.2 it doubles as the benchmark's **episode factory**: `--seed <n>`
(or a mid-session `{"type":"reset","seed":n}` command) generates a World Gym
model in-process and serves it over the same JSONL protocol, with an
`episode: {seed, family, corrupted}` descriptor on generated-episode resets.
Corruption defaults to the benchmark's deterministic Bernoulli(0.3) draw;
`--corrupt` / `--no-corrupt` / `--corrupt-rate p` override. The factory
needs the repo checkout (the npm package does not ship tools/world-gym; it
fails with a clear error there and `--model` keeps working). The five
corpus-level channels above and the gym's interactive channels remain
different layers; `computeRewardChannels` stays the corpus/manifest API.

## Determinism

`IfcCreator` historically had two entropy sources with no seed hook - the
wall clock (owner-history + STEP header `FILE_NAME` timestamps) and
`crypto.randomUUID()` for every `IfcGloballyUniqueId` - which world-gym used
to work around by monkey-patching `globalThis.Date` /
`crypto.randomUUID` for the duration of each build
(`lib/deterministic-runtime.mjs`, deleted). PR #1879 added first-class
`ProjectParams.Timestamp` + `ProjectParams.GuidSource` options, and the
generator now uses those via `lib/deterministic-create.mjs`.

Byte-compat matters: the corpus, benchmark results and the determinism
re-proofs are all pinned by seed. `seededGuidSource(seed)` therefore replays
the exact GUID byte stream the old shim produced (32 raw hex nibbles per
UUID from `Rng('guid:' + seed)`, no v4 version/variant forcing, encoded with
the canonical `uuidToIfcGuid`), and the pinned instant is unchanged - every
seed's file is byte-identical to what the shim generated. Do not switch the
stream to proper v4 UUIDs without re-baselining the whole corpus.

**Result: `node determinism-check.mjs --seeds 20` - 20/20 seeds
byte-identical across two runs, wall-clock gap included; corrupted models
verified byte-identical the same way; the 100k channel report re-proved
10,000 models by regenerate-and-rehash with 0 failures.**

## 100k corpus run - results (this machine, 10 cores, 10 workers)

```text
requested / completed / failed:   100000 / 100000 / 0

label coverage:                   100000/100000 (100%): entity counts, quantities,
                                   schema verdict, clash verdict, quantity re-extraction

                                   manifest sha256; 100/100 tampered candidates score 0

per-model timing:                  generation median 1 ms; total (gen+label) median 7 ms, p95 33 ms
```

Reward-channel distributions over this corpus (clean mean / corrupted mean):
`schemaValidity` 1.0 / 0.325, `clashScore` 1.0 / 0.817, `quantityAccuracy`
1.0 / 0.935 (293 distinct values, min 0.52), `defectDetection` 1.0 / 0.855
(the shortfall is exactly the invisible `dangling-ref`),
`determinismHashMatch` 1 on every self-evaluation and 0 on every tampered
candidate. No channel is constant across classes.

Corpus artifacts (manifest.jsonl ~190 MB, summary.json, channels-report.json,
oracle-report.json) are run outputs written outside the repo; they are not
checked in. `.ifc` bytes are not kept at this scale (`--no-keep-files`) -
every model is reproducible from its seed, and `oracle-validate.mjs`
verifies regenerated sha256 against the manifest before using regenerated
bytes.

### Throughput: what changed vs v1

v1 paid two fresh `node dist/index.js` subprocess launches per model
(validate + clash), ~1.4 s median per model, 6.6 models/sec on 10 workers.
v2 imports the same building blocks in-process and keeps one WASM geometry
processor warm per worker: median label cost fell to ~6 ms, throughput rose
to 791 models/sec end to end (measured A/B on 200 models: 6.58/s subprocess
vs 186/s in-process, the latter pool-start dominated; at 100k scale
amortization pushes it to 791/s). A 100k corpus now costs ~2 minutes on one
laptop; 1M extrapolates to ~21 minutes.

## IfcOpenShell differential oracle

`oracle-validate.mjs` + `oracle_validate.py` spot-validate labels against
IfcOpenShell 0.8.5 (the exact pin from
`tools/ifcopenshell_reference/requirements.lock`; the harness's own local
venv recipe applies). Per sampled model, the oracle independently:

- parses the file and confirms the schema;
- recounts entities per type (expectations adjusted for planted text
  defects);
- recounts duplicate GlobalIds (must equal planted count, 0 for clean);
- re-sums the embedded GymQuantities and compares to the labeler's
  extraction at 1e-6 relative tolerance;
- meshes every product with its own geometry kernel and compares slab /
  column / beam volumes to ground truth at 1%, and wall volumes net of the
  planted openings;
- verifies the planted footing pairs overlap by the recorded penetration in
  ITS geometry (AABB overlap, 1 mm tolerance);
- verifies the planted zero-height columns are degenerate for it too.

Result on the 100k corpus (200-model deterministic sample, `seed % 500 ==
0`, 144 clean / 56 corrupted): **200/200 models pass all seven checks**
(parse, entity-counts, guid-dups, quantities, geometry-volume, clash-pairs,
degenerate), with 0/200 regeneration sha mismatches. The validation layers each caught a real
corpus bug during bring-up: the 100k agreement stats caught
`String.replace` garbling planted duplicate GUIDs containing `$` (a
replacement-pattern metacharacter, 120 affected models), and the oracle
caught the duplicated IfcProject silently doubling as an unplanned GUID dup
- both fixed in `lib/corruption.mjs`. The redundancy is doing its job.

## Deviation from the brief / known gaps

- **The discipline clash matrix is structurally blind to this corpus.**
  `disciplineMatrixRules()` only pairs MEP/HVAC/ELEC/FIRE selectors against
  structure/architecture; a corpus containing only walls, slabs, columns,
  beams and spaces can never fire a single matrix rule. The v1 pilot's
  "0 clashes across 1,000 models" was therefore vacuous - not evidence of
  clean geometry. v2 keeps the matrix (parity) and adds an `IfcFooting`
  self-clash rule that the injected clash pairs (a type no clean family
  emits) trigger exactly. A follow-up should add ARCH/STR self-clash rules
  plus baseline-noise budgets so the channel can grade *organic* clashes
  too, not only planted ones.
- **`dangling-ref` is undetected by `ifc-lite validate`.** The planted
  ground truth records it anyway, and the `defectDetection` channel scores
  the miss (models carrying it score < 1) - surfacing the gap instead of
  hiding it. Upstream candidate: a reference-integrity rule in
  `computeValidationIssues`.
- **`ifc-lite validate` exits non-zero on invalid files**, so the v1
  subprocess labeler could not even record a negative schema verdict
  (`schemaCheck.ok = false` instead of `valid: false`) - visible in the A/B
  run. The in-process engine reads the verdict directly; the subprocess
  path keeps the flaw for honesty.
- **`ifc-lite clash --json` leaks non-JSON diagnostics to stdout** (from
  the geometry pipeline's console bindings, some captured at WASM init and
  immune to scoped console patching - in-process the labeler patches
  console to stderr process-wide at init). Still worth fixing upstream in
  `packages/cli` / `packages/geometry`.
- **GlobalId/timestamp non-determinism in `@ifc-lite/create` /
  `@ifc-lite/encoding`** - see "Determinism". Worked around via a runtime
  shim, not fixed at the source.
- **`ifc-lite gym` integration is DONE** (B2.2): the generator is wired into
  the gym as an episode factory (`--seed` / reset-with-seed, see Reward
  channels above), with tests in `packages/cli/src/commands/gym.test.ts`.
  Still open on that surface: `HeadlessBackend.mutate` remains a no-op stub
  (the gym drives `MutablePropertyView` directly), no entity-creation ops,
  `done` never fires, `observation.bounds` always null.
- **The defect-detection task is near-saturated by text heuristics
  (measured, v1.0).** On the dev split the no-kernel `heuristic-text`
  baseline scores macro-F1 1.0 while the kernel oracle scores 0.857 (it
  cannot see `dangling-ref`). The v1 corruption layer plants mostly
  text-level defects, so v1.0's defect task rewards pattern-matching the
  corruption conventions; real headroom currently lives in
  quantity-estimation (both anchors 0.978 - the missing-quantities share
  requires geometry to recover) and in generalization. Spec v1.1 should add
  geometric/organic defect families (misalignment, unit-scale errors,
  off-by-storey placement) that text scans cannot see. Documented in
  BENCHMARK.md section 5.
- **The test split has no integrity property today, and hosting alone would
  not give it one.** Labels are regenerable-by-seed by design (open
  generator), so local test rows are self-reported. v1.0 called this
  "hidden-by-hosting"; that claim was false and v1.1 withdraws it -
  `benchmark/attacks/clean-twin-diff.mjs` scores an exact 1.000 aggregate
  through the real scorer while reading only model bytes, because the
  adversary regenerates the served bytes rather than requesting them. The
  trusted channel v1.1 declares is a per-split secret salt mixed into every
  RNG stream, delivered by a hosted scorer. **v1.2 implements the salt and
  measures it** (`lib/salt.mjs`, `benchmark/splits.mjs#saltForSplit`,
  evidence in `scripts/moonshot/b43-benchmark-salt/`): against a salted
  reporting split the same attack collapses from 1.000 to the level of a
  submission that knows nothing about the split, while an honest baseline
  reading the served bytes is unaffected. **The delivery half is still
  missing**, so no salt is configured anywhere, the reporting split is still
  the public universe, and test rows are still self-reported
  (BENCHMARK.md section 1a; rotation procedure in 1b). Public hosting,
  benchmark governance/licensing, and external-lab recruitment are
  HUMAN-track items (execution plan B2.2), not covered by this code.
- **Leaderboard verifier is Node-side, not yet client-side in a browser.**
  The M2 final exam wants the leaderboard verifier running client-side;
  score.mjs + the generator are plain ESM with no Node-only APIs beyond
  fs/crypto entrypoints, so a browser build is packaging work, but it is
  not done.
- Coverage is intentionally narrower than everything `packages/create`
  supports (stairs, roofs, doors, windows, ramps, railings, plates,
  members, piles, curtain walls, ...). The family module interface
  (`{ name, paramSpace(rng), build(creator, params) }`) is designed so a
  third family drops in without touching `generator.mjs`, `labeler.mjs`, or
  `run-pilot.mjs`.
- Room footprints in `office` use grid centerlines (documented v1
  approximation, unchanged).

## Constraints honored

- Own path: everything lives under `tools/world-gym/**`; nothing outside
  that path was modified (gaps above are documented, not patched, for
  exactly that reason).
- No new npm dependencies - plain `.mjs` with Node built-ins plus relative
  imports into already-built `packages/*/dist`. The oracle needs a python
  venv with `ifcopenshell==0.8.5` (same pin as
  `tools/ifcopenshell_reference`), created outside the repo.
- Generated corpora (IFC files, manifests, reports) are written outside the
  repo and are not checked in.
