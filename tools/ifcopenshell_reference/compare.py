"""Join a reference dump against an ifc-lite dump and classify every element.

Usage:
    python compare.py --reference ref.json --ifclite lite.json \
        [--allowlist allowlist.json] [--report out.json]

Classes:
    MATCH           both ok, all gated stats within tolerance
    MISMATCH        both ok, a gated stat out of tolerance      -> fails
    IFCLITE_ONLY    ifc-lite produced geometry, reference skipped
    REFERENCE_ONLY  reference produced geometry, ifc-lite skipped -> fails
    BOTH_SKIP       agreement on no-geometry

Gating policy (calibrated against the previously hand-baked constants in
door_window_calibration_regression.rs AND a full duplex run): METRIC truth
gates, topology is advisory.
    bbox min/max   GATED, within 1 mm per axis
    volume         GATED, relative 1%, only when BOTH sides are closed
    tri_count      ADVISORY (flagged in the report beyond a 50%/16-triangle
                   band, never failing): the engines legitimately triangulate
                   identical solids at different densities - duplex wall #5448
                   is 92 vs 308 triangles with the SAME 1 mm bbox and volumes
                   agreeing to 0.001%, and exact-CSG retriangulation densifies
                   cut faces by design. A dropped feature shows up in bbox or
                   volume; triangle counts alone would keep the gate
                   permanently red over healthy divergence.
    vertex_count   NOT EVALUATED: carried in the dumps for human diffing
                   only - welding topology differs legitimately (duplex #6426:
                   identical bbox + tri_count, 56 vs 48 welded verts), so
                   classify() neither gates nor flags it; `closed` likewise
                   feeds only the volume-usability checks above.

An allowlisted MISMATCH/REFERENCE_ONLY is reported but does not fail, so
every accepted divergence is a reviewed, diffable decision. Exit code is
non-zero iff a non-allowlisted MISMATCH or REFERENCE_ONLY exists.

# Cost differential parity (issue #4859, parent #4322)
#
# A second, independent comparator sharing this file rather than a parallel
# module: the geometry comparator above and this one are two instantiations
# of the same pattern (two engines, a canonical record, a classifier that
# distinguishes real matches from real divergences), and keeping the cost
# variant IN this pre-existing file - rather than in its own new module -
# means a revert of only the cost-adding hunk leaves `compare.py` itself
# intact and importable, so `test_harness_cost.py`'s `import compare` always
# succeeds; the reverted hunk shows up as a missing attribute inside a test
# BODY (AssertionError/AttributeError - a real red), never as a collection-
# time ImportError that hides every assertion behind a load failure. See
# `scripts/check-test-revert-oracle.mjs` for why that distinction matters.

#
# Classification
# ---------------
#
# Every comparable fact (a Schedule, an Item, a Node, a scalar field) is
# classified as exactly one of:
#
# - COST_MATCH: values agree (numeric fields compared with
#   COST_NUMERIC_TOLERANCE).
# - DEGRADED:<name>: a mismatch in one of the two *explicitly enumerated*
#   degradation categories below, each of which requires BOTH sides to carry
#   a specific paired diagnostic/marker that explains the divergence. A
#   mismatch that isn't one of these two named, evidenced cases is never
#   absorbed here.
# - COST_FAILURE: everything else - including a GlobalId present on only one
#   side, any structural (parent/child/shared-reference) disagreement, and
#   any numeric disagreement outside tolerance.
#
# Enumerated degradations (closed set - DO NOT add a bare "give it a pass"
# category here without a paired diagnostic; see #4859's review guidance):
#
#   DEGRADED:IFC2X3_PARTIAL_READ
#     ifc-lite reports a value node's Resolved as null while the reference
#     resolves a number, PAIRED with the ifc-lite dump's own DiagnosticCodes
#     carrying 'IFC2X3_PARTIAL_READ' (the read model declaring it did not
#     evaluate values). Scoped to schema_version == 'IFC2X3'. A NON-null
#     ifc-lite number that disagrees is a FAILURE even on IFC2X3.
#
#   DEGRADED:CURRENCY_UNRESOLVED
#     ifc-lite reports Currency as null on a ResolvedTotal/Node while the
#     reference resolves a currency code, PAIRED with the model-level
#     `Currency` field also being null in the ifc-lite dump (i.e. ifc-lite
#     could not resolve *any* project currency, not a spot omission). A lite
#     ResolvedTotal missing its currency while the lite model-level Currency
#     IS resolved is a FAILURE.
#
# A row that "matches" only because BOTH sides are empty is refused outright:
# `compare_cost()` raises before classifying anything if the reference
# dump's own `HasCostData` is false, or if it has zero Items - an
# empty-vs-empty comparison proves nothing about parity and must not report
# success.
# =============================================================================

COST_NUMERIC_TOLERANCE = 1e-6

# IfcUnitEnum values for which both dumpers derive a unit node's Dimension
# (and so a Symbol): dump_reference_cost.py's UNIT_TYPE_DIMENSION and

# unit of one of these types with Symbol or Dimension null is unresolved
# metadata, never a match - not even when BOTH sides are null. Other unit
