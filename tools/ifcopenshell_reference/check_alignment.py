"""Independent check of ifc-lite's IfcAlignment output against IfcOpenShell.

WHY. ifc-lite's own parser cannot evaluate an IFC4X3 IfcAlignment at all (its
Rust evaluator handles IFC4x1 alignment curves only), so every in-repo test of
the LandXML->IFC alignment path would be ifc-lite grading its own arithmetic.
This script has IfcOpenShell do the grading, in two independent ways:

1. MAPPING PARITY. For every IfcAlignmentSegment, IfcOpenShell regenerates the
   IfcCurveSegment from OUR IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment through its own
   `_map_alignment_horizontal_segment`, and the result must equal the
   IfcCurveSegment we wrote: placement, direction, SegmentStart, SegmentLength,
   parent curve type and its defining parameter. This is what proves the
   geometry is the one a consumer derives from the semantics.
2. EVALUATION. IfcOpenShell's geometry kernel evaluates each of our
   IfcCurveSegments at its start and end. Every boundary must land on the point
   the LandXML source AUTHORED (passed in as JSON), not on a point we computed.
   A sign error in a radius or a direction lands elsewhere, and this says where.

REFUSES TO PASS VACUOUSLY: no alignment found, a segment count that does not
match the authored boundaries, or ifcopenshell not importable all fail.

Usage:
    python3 check_alignment.py <file.ifc> <authored.json>

authored.json: {"<alignment name>": [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ...]} — the authored
boundary points of each alignment, in order (n segments -> n+1 points), in the
file's length unit, as (X, Y) = (easting, northing).
