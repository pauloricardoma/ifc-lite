/**
 * Lint: everything that crosses a collab room's boundary must address the ROOM
 * model by id — never "whatever model is active" (#2705, and the edit paths).
 *
 * `setIfcDataStore` / `setGeometryResult` and the top-level `ifcDataStore`
 * track `activeModelId` (dataSlice.ts), and `upsertModel` keeps the existing
 * `activeModelId` rather than switching to the model it creates
 * (modelSlice.ts). So a user who joins a room and then loads and selects their
 * own file — two clicks — has a different model active, and every path that
 * said "active" meant the wrong model:
 *
 *   1. the recipient's `reconstruct` replaced the user's own store and meshes
 *      with the room's on the next peer edit (#2705; repaired by a reload);
 *   2. inbound peer edits were replayed into the user's own model's view under
 *      a room-id-space expressId, landing in that view's overlay and
 *      `mutationHistory` — the export path (survives a reload);
 *   3. outbound, the user's edits on their PRIVATE model were mirrored into the
 *      shared room and applied to whatever entity the id resolved to there.
 *
 * The fixes are `applyRoomModelData` (room-model-apply.ts) and the resolvers in
 * room-model-target.ts, both unit-tested. THIS file pins the wiring, which is
 * the half that was wrong and the half no test holds: reverting the call sites
 * leaves `tsc --noEmit` clean and the whole viewer suite green, because the
 * collab session path needs jsdom, module mocking, `import.meta.env`,
 * IndexedDB and a websocket and so cannot be driven under `tsx --test`.
 *
 * An absence claim over a few regions of two files is a lint, not a unit test,
 * so it lives here — `scripts/check-source-text-assertions.mjs` forbids exactly
 * this shape inside a test file, and `check-unbounded-frame-wait.mjs` /
 * `check-wasm-disposal.mjs` are the same shape for the same reason.
 *
 * Every check below fails closed: a region that cannot be located, or that no
 * longer routes through the by-id helper, is an error rather than a silent
 * pass. An absence guard that scans nothing passes forever.
 *
 * The outbound checks (3 and 4) are STRUCTURAL rather than a text scan for a
 * remembered pattern, because the earlier "somewhere in this file there is at
 * least one gate" shape was evadable in exactly the way it existed to prevent —
 * a gate could be deleted from most call sites, or aliased past
 * (`const st = get;`), and still pass. Instead:
 *
 *   - the set of actions to check is ENUMERATED from the source, keyed on
 *     "takes an entityId", so a newly added mirror is covered on the day it is
 *     written rather than the day someone updates this file;
 *   - each one must both TAKE a `modelId` and resolve through the single call
 *     that binds the store to it, so the gate cannot be half-performed;
 *   - every call site is checked, not just one, and the per-action counts are
 *     floored so a deletion is a deliberate diff.
 *
 * Run via `node scripts/check-collab-room-model-target.mjs` (CI node-test job).
