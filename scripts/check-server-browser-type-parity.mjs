/**
 * Lint: for each of several concepts (relationships, spatial types,
 * properties, quantities, materials), the set of IFC type names the Rust
 * server (`apps/server/src/services/data_model/*.rs`) switches on must match
 * the set the TypeScript/browser parser (`packages/parser/src/*.ts`,
 * `packages/data/src/*.ts`) switches on — with an explicit, documented
 * allowlist for divergences that are intentional or already being fixed.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE (issue #3966): five defects in two days were the same
 * pattern — the Rust server path and the TS/WASM path independently
 * implement the same extraction, drift apart, and nothing notices because
 * each side is internally self-consistent (#3949, #3948/#3955, #3963,
 * #3964, #3965). Georeferencing already has a dual-implementation parity
 * harness driven by shared fixture vectors
 * (`rust/core/tests/georef_parity.rs` / `packages/parser/src/georef.parity.test.ts`);
 * building the equivalent OUTPUT-comparison harness for these five concepts
 * would mean inventing a shared fixture format for five different data
 * shapes across two languages, which is real work with no shortcut. The
 * issue itself names the cheap version that would have caught three of the
 * five: comparing the two sides' TYPE-NAME SETS. This gate is that version.
 *
 * APPROACH CHOSEN, AND WHY: parse both sources for the type-name string
 * literals they switch on (`scripts/check-clash-degenerate-reason-parity.mjs`
 * is the precedent for this exact shape in this repo, and its own header
 * explains why it lives here rather than in a test file: reading two
 * SOURCES and diffing their text is exactly what
 * `check-source-text-assertions.mjs` bans inside a test, because there it
 * would be standing in for running the code. Here there is no way to run
 * either side "and compare": there is no shared fixture format, and the two
 * outputs (Rust `PropertySet`/`Relationship`/... vs TS `IfcDataStore`
 * columnar tables) do not share a wire shape to diff. A structural read of
 * both sources is the only thing that can name "what a type SWITCHES ON"; a
 * lint is the honest place for it, same call the clash-reason and
 * legacy-entity-coverage gates already made). This is brittle to a rename or
 * a source reshuffle (documented per concept below) but requires no runtime
 * and catches exactly the defect shape all five instances had: a type
 * present in one match/switch and silently absent from the other.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER: attribute INDICES within a matched type (e.g. a
 * type present on both sides but reading the wrong attribute offset — #3949
 * was that shape, not a missing-type shape), edge ORIENTATION (which side is
 * "relating" vs "related"), or VALUE semantics once a type is matched. Only
 * the set of type names each side is willing to handle at all.
 *
 * VACUITY GUARD, per concept: both extractors must return a non-empty set.
 * Two empty sets are "equal", so a broken extractor (source moved, regex
 * anchor drifted) would otherwise pass silently instead of reporting drift.
 * ONE EXCEPTION: `tsPropertyTypes` unconditionally seeds its result with
 * `IFCPROPERTYSINGLEVALUE` (see that function's doc comment — the TS
 * `default` switch arm has no quoted literal for a regex to find), so
 * `properties` TS-side can never be empty and that half of this guard can
 * never fire for that one concept. This is deliberate — the seed is correct
 * behaviour, not a bug to "fix" by removing it — but it means the guard is
 * NOT actually bilateral for `properties`: only the Rust side can trip it
 * there. Every other concept's guard is bilateral as documented.
 *
 * UNDER-READ GUARD: any extractor that reads exactly ONE bounded region
 * throws `ExtractorUnderReadError` — caught below and reported as a third
 * failure category, distinct from vacuity — if a SIBLING binding that looks
 * like it carries more IFC type literals exists in the same file. This
 * closes a silent-pass shape found in review of relationships (a later patch
 * adding types via a new `let extra_rel_types = [...]` array, or a fourth
 * `*_REL_TYPES` Set, alongside the existing one would otherwise never be
 * read) — and the identical shape was found, unguarded, in spatialTypes
 * (`is_spatial_type`; `SPATIAL_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ENUMS`) and the TS half of
 * quantities (`QUANTITY_TYPE_MAP`), all three now guarded the same way.
 * `properties`, `materials`, and the Rust half of `quantities` scan their
 * WHOLE source with an unanchored `matchAll` rather than one bounded region,
 * so they do not have this failure mode and are not guarded here. See
 * `scripts/lib/server-browser-type-extractors.mjs` for each detector call
 * and its scoping rationale (why it does not also fire on a file's other,
 * unrelated bindings of the same syntactic shape).
 *
 * THE ALLOWLIST is the mechanism that keeps this gate from being either
 * useless (allowlisting everything) or naggy (failing on every open fix in
 * flight). Every entry names the exact type, the concept, and WHY it is
 * listed — a tracked deliberate gap (#3254) or an open PR already fixing the
 * exact divergence this gate would otherwise report (#3969/#3971/#3973). A
 * divergence not on the list fails loudly; the list only ever grows with a
 * reviewed reason attached, never silently.
 *
 * STALE-ALLOWLIST DETECTION (#3979) closes the other half of that
 * mechanism: growth is enforced (an undocumented divergence fails loudly)
 * but nothing ever checked SHRINKAGE — once a listed PR merges, the entry
 * keeps muting a divergence that no longer exists, forever, because a muted
 * concept never fails and nothing prompts a human to go re-read it. The
 * check itself (`staleAllowlistEntries`, applied to `pending` AND
 * `deliberate` entries alike, its full rationale and known limit) lives in
 * `scripts/lib/allowlist-staleness.mjs` — split out purely to stay under
 * this file's module-size budget, wired in by the runner below.
 *
 * Run via `node scripts/check-server-browser-type-parity.mjs` (CI node-test
 * job, see .github/workflows/test.yml). `--root <dir>` points every read at
 * an alternate tree; `check-server-browser-type-parity.test.mjs` uses it to
 * drive the unmodified checker against mutated copies of the real sources.
 * `--hierarchy-schema-source <file>` is a second, TEST-ONLY flag: see
 * `hierarchy-schema-loader.mjs` for why HIERARCHY_REL_TYPES needs a
 * separate seam from `--root` to be mutation-testable at all.
