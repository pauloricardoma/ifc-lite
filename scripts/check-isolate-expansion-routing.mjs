/**
 * GATE for issue #3338: "expansion is one call site every channel must
 * remember to use."
 *
 * `expandToGeometryBearingIds` (`apps/viewer/src/utils/aggregation.ts`)
 * replaces a geometry-less `IfcElementAssembly` id with its `IfcRelAggregates`
 * parts. It is reached through exactly one production entry point,
 * `cameraCallbacks.resolveHighlightIds` (wired by `Viewport.tsx`'s
 * `resolveHighlightIds` callback) -- so any code path that calls the store's
 * `isolateEntities` with ids the USER selected (a ref, a search hit, a filter
 * row, an assembly by GUID) is only correct if it routes the ids through that
 * resolver first. Nothing in the type system enforces this: `isolateEntities`
 * takes a bare `number[]`, so a channel that skips the resolver still
 * typechecks and still isolates -- it just isolates a mesh-less id, and the
 * viewport goes blank.
 *
 * This happened twice nine hours apart (#2531, #2532) with no CI run
 * containing both sides, and a fifth channel (the SDK/MCP `isolate()` call,
 * `apps/viewer/src/sdk/adapters/visibility-adapter.ts`) carried the same gap
 * until #3382. A sixth channel this gate's own audit found:
 * `apps/viewer-embed/src/bridge/handler.ts`'s `ISOLATE` postMessage command
 * (fixed alongside this gate, same PR).
 *
 * A SEVENTH channel surfaced after this gate shipped, from an adversarial
 * review of the gate itself: `apps/viewer-embed/src/components/
 * useEmbedUrlParams.ts`'s `?isolate=` handler calls `setIsolatedEntities(`,
 * never `isolateEntities(` -- the visibility slice's other raw-id isolation
 * actuator (ASSIGNS instead of TOGGLING; see `SET_ISOLATED_CALL_PATTERN`).
 * A gate that only watched one of the two sibling actions let a channel
 * dodge it for free by picking the other one, so the gate now watches both
 * (`RAW_ISOLATION_ACTIONS`), and every OTHER direct `setIsolatedEntities`
 * caller was audited at the same time -- see `REQUIRES_ROUTING_MARKER` and
 * `NO_MARKER_REQUIRED` below for what each one turned out to need.
 *
 * Run: `node scripts/check-isolate-expansion-routing.mjs` (also
 * `pnpm check:isolate-expansion-routing`).
 *
 * ## What counts as a channel
 *
 * Any non-test `.ts`/`.tsx` file under `apps/viewer/src` or
 * `apps/viewer-embed/src` that calls one of `POLICED_ACTIONS` --
 * `isolateEntities`, `setIsolatedEntities`, `hideEntities`, `showEntities`,
 * `updateMeshColors` (directly, via `state.`, the optional-call form
 * `?.(`, a destructured/aliased local binding of either (`const {
 * isolateEntities: apply } = ...`, including `let`/reassignment and
 * function-parameter destructuring -- see `ALIAS_DESTRUCTURE_PATTERN`), or a
 * plain member-access rebinding (`const apply = state.isolateEntities;` --
 * see `PROPERTY_ALIAS_PATTERN`) on the viewer store's `visibilitySlice`.
 * Test files (`*.test.ts(x)`) are excluded -- the fixtures IN this gate's
 * own test file, and the wiring tests that already pin each of these seven
 * channels, would otherwise all read as new channels.
 *
 * ## Two ways to fail
 *
 * 1. UNKNOWN CHANNEL: a file calls one of `POLICED_ACTIONS`
 *    and is not in either allowlist below. This is the "a channel nobody
 *    enumerated" failure mode -- new code that isolates ids has to be
 *    triaged into one of the two lists (with a reason), not silently pass.
 * 2. LOST ROUTING: a file in `REQUIRES_ROUTING_MARKER` has a policed CALL
 *    SITE whose own argument does not reach one of the resolvers in
 *    `ROUTING_MARKERS`. This catches a channel that HAD the fix regressing --
 *    e.g. a refactor that inlines the handler and drops the
 *    `cameraCallbacks.resolveHighlightIds` call along the way. Asked per call
 *    site rather than per file (#3338 review): a file that routes four
 *    channels answered the file-level question with any one of them, so
 *    stripping the routing from one call site went unnoticed. A single action
 *    in such a file can opt out through `EXEMPT_ACTIONS`, with a reason.
 *
 * `NO_MARKER_REQUIRED` covers the other two shapes a compliant channel can
 * take: a DIFFERENT, already-verified expansion mechanism (HierarchyPanel's
 * class/type/group tabs isolate ids that `treeDataBuilder.ts` already
 * resolved to geometry-bearing members at tree-build time, via
 * `hasAggregatedGeometry`/`collectAggregatedDescendants` -- a different,
 * non-renderer-dependent path to the same correctness property), and a
 * TRACKED, IN-FLIGHT fix (an entry citing an open PR). Both need a `reason`;
 * neither is silent.
 *
 * ## LIMITATIONS -- read before assuming coverage
 *
 *  - Data flow is followed, but only through LOCAL ASSIGNMENTS, and only a
 *    bounded number of hops (`ASSIGNMENT_WALK_DEPTH`). "Lost routing" used to
 *    ask whether a ROUTING_MARKERS token appeared ANYWHERE in the file, which
 *    made the question vacuous for the two files that route four channels
 *    each: deleting `visibility-adapter.ts`'s isolate() routing left the file
 *    green because its hide() still routed. `unroutedCallSites` now checks
 *    each call site's own argument, following `const x = resolver(...)` into
 *    the call that uses `x`. A value that reaches the action through a helper
 *    function, a ref, or a component prop still reads as UNROUTED -- a false
 *    failure a reviewer clears with an allowlist entry, which is the safe
 *    direction.
 *  - An ALIASED call (`const { isolateEntities: apply } = ...; apply(ids)`)
 *    has no literal call site to check, so for those files the gate falls
 *    back to the old file-level question rather than passing them silently.
 *  - `setPendingColorUpdates`, the OTHER colour actuator, is not policed --
 *    31 call sites across 14 files, unaudited. See `POLICED_ACTIONS`.
 *  - Textual match, not parsed: `ROUTING_MARKERS` and `CALL_PATTERN` are
 *    regexes over raw source. `ALIAS_DESTRUCTURE_PATTERN` closes the specific
 *    gap an adversarial review found in `isolateEntities` itself -- a
 *    destructured, renamed store binding (`const { isolateEntities:
 *    applyIsolation } = useViewerStore()`) is now flagged as a candidate even
 *    though the literal token `isolateEntities(` never appears again. The
 *    SAME gap still exists on the `ROUTING_MARKERS` side: a call spelled
 *    through a renamed local alias (`const rhi = cameraCallbacks
 *    .resolveHighlightIds; rhi(ids)`) or reached via dynamic dispatch is not
 *    detected there, and a flagged file that routes ONLY that way would read
 *    as unrouted. Not observed in the scanned tree.
 *  - "Textual match, not parsed" cuts both ways: a demonstrated instance was
 *    that a call-SHAPED fragment inside a line comment, a block comment, or a
 *    string literal (`// cameraCallbacks.resolveHighlightIds(ids)`, or the same
 *    text quoted as `"resolveHighlightIds(ids)"`) satisfied `ROUTING_MARKERS`
 *    even though no such call executes -- exactly the false GREEN this gate
 *    exists to prevent (a routing call commented out during a refactor would
 *    read as "still routed"). `classifyFile` now runs every pattern above
 *    against `stripCommentsAndStrings(content)` rather than raw `content` to
 *    close that. That stripper is itself a naive, non-parsing pass -- see its
 *    own doc comment for exactly what it does and does not handle (regex
 *    literals, escaped-quote parity, template-literal interpolations). It
 *    does not change the two gaps above: a real call reached only through a
 *    renamed alias, or a real call in an unrelated part of the file, is still
 *    invisible/insufficiently-precise the same way.
 *  - Scope is `apps/viewer/src` and `apps/viewer-embed/src` only.
 *    `packages/viewer` (the separate server-side streaming HTML viewer,
 *    `viewer-html.ts`/`streaming-viewer.ts`/`server.ts`) also has an
 *    `isolateEntities` action name, but it is a completely different
 *    protocol against a plain `entityMap`/`colorOverrides` -- it has never
 *    imported `apps/viewer/src/utils/aggregation.ts` and does not share the
 *    store or `cameraCallbacks` this gate's mechanism depends on. Extending
 *    assembly expansion there is a separate feature, not a regression of
 *    this one, so it is out of this gate's scope rather than silently
 *    passed.

 *     binds a local alias the same way a `const` destructure does, but the
 *     brace is followed by `)` or a type annotation, never `=`.
 * The pattern below drops the keyword requirement and accepts the brace
 * being followed by `=`, `)`, or `:` (a nested destructure target, or a
 * parameter's type annotation), while still requiring `[^{}]` instead of
 * `[^}]` so it cannot cross into an unrelated outer scope (e.g. an

 *   - A regex literal containing a quote or `//`/`/*` sequence (e.g.

 *     quote or slash characters can desync the scan for the rest of the
 *     file. Not observed in the scanned tree.
 *   - Escaped-quote handling is a single backslash lookback (`\"` inside a
 *     string skips the quote), not a parity count -- a string ending in an
 *     even run of backslashes before its closing quote (`"a\\\\"`, a literal
 *     backslash followed by a real close) is handled correctly, but this was
 *     verified by construction, not by tracking backslash-run parity, so an
 *     unusual escape sequence could still mislead it.
 *   - A `${...}` interpolation inside a template literal is stripped along
 *     with the rest of the backtick span -- a call that legitimately lives
 *     inside an interpolation (`` `${resolveHighlightIds(ids)}` ``) is
 *     treated the same as a call inside dead text and will not be seen as a
 *     routing call. Not observed in the scanned tree; a channel routing
