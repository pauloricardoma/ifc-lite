/**
 * The content-matching validation fixture (issue #1891's instrument).
 *
 * Answers "does the matcher work", not "do its unit tests pass": it builds a
 * head revision of a real model whose true correspondence is known BY
 * CONSTRUCTION, runs the shipped matcher over the shipped fingerprints, and
 * scores precision and recall against that key — stratified by tier, by
 * mutation kind, and by geometry class.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/xmatch/run.mjs                 # score, write the scorecard
 *   node scripts/xmatch/run.mjs --self-test     # mutation-check the harness
 *   node scripts/xmatch/run.mjs --write         # update the committed scorecard
 *   node scripts/xmatch/run.mjs --keep          # keep the generated head files
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 a threshold or guard failed, 2 could not run at all
 * (missing fixture, missing wasm, missing build).
