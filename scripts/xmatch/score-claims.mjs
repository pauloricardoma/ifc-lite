 * one of two negative-control counters, both with a zero ceiling:
 * `insertedNearby` when the head is the small element planted inside a deleted
 * element's box, `neighbourSuccessor` for any other wrong partner — including
 * every claim on a `deleted` base, which has no counterpart at all, and a
 * claim that offers half of a split as the whole's successor.
 *
 * A claim on a base the key expected CONTENT matching to recover (a `renamed`

 * that found the pre-existing version scored every real merge as an
 * automatic `bySplit` wrong, sinking `bySplit.precision` the moment merges
 * stopped being hypothetical.
 *
 * `kindAgreement` is about the confidence: `verified` is expected whenever
 * the whole and both pieces carry a proved volume, `extent` otherwise. The
 * geometry pass decides which — an open shell has no volume by design — so
