/**
 * The answer key's source of truth: a seeded, declared mutation of a real model.
 *
 * Given a model from `tests/models/` and a seed, this produces a head revision
 * and the TRUE correspondence between the two — keyed by **source express id**,
 * a channel the matcher never sees. The key is produced by CONSTRUCTION (the
 * generator writes down what it did) rather than by any hash, comparison or
 * heuristic, which is what makes it an answer key rather than a second opinion.
 *
 * The head is a from-scratch re-export of the sort the content matcher exists
 * for: every `IfcRoot` gets a new GlobalId, and every express id is permuted,
 * so no line, id or key survives to correlate the two files by accident.
 *
 * ## The re-GUID trap this file is built around
 *
 * A naive re-GUID rewrites "every 22-character quoted token". That also renames
 * `Qto_WallBaseQuantities` and `SpaceTemperatureSummer` — both exactly 22
 * characters in the IFC base64 alphabet — which changes property *names*, moves
 * every data hash, and makes the matcher look broken when the fixture is. Here
 * the rewrite is anchored to **attribute 0 of statements whose type inherits
 * from `IfcRoot`**, decided from the bundled schema registry. `run.mjs` then
 * asserts the property- and quantity-set name multisets are identical between
 * base and head, so a regression in this file surfaces as a failed guard rather
 * than as a mysterious 0% recall.

// identifiers unrepresentable — they may be rejected outright, or decode and
// re-encode to a DIFFERENT string, which in a fixture whose premise is "this
// is what a plausible re-export looks like" would eventually surface as a
// matcher bug. `generateIfcGuid` goes through `uuidToIfcGuid`, so the
// constraint is enforced by construction rather than by remembering it here.
