 * This is the specific regression the other two mutants do NOT model: a

 * beats the real engine's recall on every model in the corpus:
 *
 *   duplex  0.920128 -> 0.926518   at precision 0.903427
 *   AC20    0.825397 -> 0.841270   at precision 0.791045
 *   rvt01   0.939693 -> 0.950658   at precision 0.942391
 *
 * So it clears every recall floor, and the fixture must still reject it. It
 * does, twice over: on the precision floors, and on `falsePairs.wrongPartner`,
 * whose ceiling is ZERO. That second one is the real defence — every wrong
 * pair increments exactly one negative-control counter, so precision below 1
 * is a hard failure before any precision floor is consulted, and the cheapest
 * way to game a recall floor is also the loudest way to fail.
