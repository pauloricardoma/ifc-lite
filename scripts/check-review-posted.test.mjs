 * inside `main()`, gated behind `!args.stateFile`. A unit under test with no
 * caller under test is not covered -- reverting ONLY the call site at the
 * `const lastPage = ...` line back to the old `Math.ceil(comments.length /
 * PER_PAGE)` left every test above green, because none of them exercise that
 * line at all.
 *
 * This drives `main()` with NO `--state-file`, a fake `gh` on PATH, and the
 * exact #4018 mixed-surface shape (97 issueComments + 4 reviewComments + 3
 * reviews) that makes the union bound (page 2) diverge from the
 * issueComments-alone bound (page 1). The fake `gh` answers the issueComments
 * probe differently per page: page 1 (correct) returns the marker that
 * "landed" during the wait; page 2 (buggy) returns an empty page, because the
 * real endpoint has only 97 rows and no second page. That divergence is what
 * makes this test able to fail on the wiring alone, with the page-bound
 * function itself untouched.
 *
 * `--timeout-seconds` is set short (5s) so the poll loop's deadline has always
 * expired by the time the one, real, 30s `POLL_SECONDS` sleep completes --
 * `POLL_SECONDS` is a module constant with no test hook, so this exercises a
 * genuine sleep rather than a mocked one, and the test runs exactly one poll
 * tick either way.
