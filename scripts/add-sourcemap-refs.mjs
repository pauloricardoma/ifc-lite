/**
 * Append a `//# sourceMappingURL=` comment to every built chunk that has a
 * sibling `.map`, so PostHog's CLI can pair the two before uploading.
 *
 * Why this exists: every chunk vite-plugin-top-level-await wraps (main, store,
 * exporters, ~85 in all) is re-printed by SWC after the bundler ran, and the
 * re-print drops the trailing sourceMappingURL comment the bundler wrote (the
 * maps themselves are kept right by patches/vite-plugin-top-level-await, see
 * scripts/tla-sourcemaps.test.mjs). posthog-cli
 * documents that it locates maps through that comment — see its
 * `--public-path-prefix` flag ("we need to ignore it while searching for
 * them") — so without it the upload may find no maps to pair. Adding the
 * comment makes the pairing true by construction rather than relying on an
 * unverified filename-convention fallback.
 *
 * `posthog-cli sourcemap process --delete-after` strips these comments (and
 * deletes the maps) after uploading, so nothing ships to users with a dangling
 * reference. The build script also sweeps any leftover `.map` regardless.
 *
 * Idempotent: a chunk that already carries a reference is skipped, so running
 * twice cannot double-append.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/add-sourcemap-refs.mjs <dir>            add references
 *   node scripts/add-sourcemap-refs.mjs <dir> --strip    remove references
 *
 * `--strip` is the cleanup path for when the upload did not run or failed: the
 * build sweeps the `.map` files out of the output either way, and a chunk left
 * pointing at a map that is no longer there makes browsers with devtools open
 * 404 on every asset. Stripping removes ANY sourceMappingURL comment, including
 * the ones the bundler emitted itself, which is correct once no maps remain.
