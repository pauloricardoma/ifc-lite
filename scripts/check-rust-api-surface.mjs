/**
 * Guard: the crate-root-reachable public Rust API of every published crate
 * (`scripts/lib/crates-io.mjs`'s `CRATES`) is snapshotted in
 * `scripts/rust-api-surface.json`. #4178 added `pub triangle_count: usize`
 * to `OpeningDiagnostic` — a `pub` struct re-exported at the
 * `ifc-lite-geometry` crate root, every field `pub`, no `#[non_exhaustive]`
 * — and nothing said this needed a major until the RELEASE PR
 * (`scripts/check-rust-semver.mjs`, issue #3216), by which point the field
 * had to be reverted to unblock the release rather than choosing the bump
 * up front (issue #4192).
 *
 * This is the SAME signal `scripts/check-api-surface.mjs` gives the
 * TypeScript side, in the same shape: a committed snapshot, diffed on every
 * PR, no build. See `scripts/lib/rust-public-api.mjs` for what is and is not
 * tracked, and why.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT REPLACE: `scripts/check-rust-semver.mjs` still runs
 * `cargo-semver-checks` against the crates.io baseline at release time and
 * catches everything a real build can see (signature/arity changes, lost
 * trait impls, defaultless trait methods, …) that a text parse cannot. This
 * gate exists to move ONE class of that gate's findings — a field or
 * variant added to a non-`#[non_exhaustive]` struct/enum — from "the release
 * PR, too late to choose cheaply" to "the PR that added it".
 *
 * Modes:
 *   node scripts/check-rust-api-surface.mjs            # check (CI)
 *   node scripts/check-rust-api-surface.mjs --update   # rewrite the snapshot
 *
 * Run via `pnpm check:rust-api-surface` / `pnpm rust-api-surface:update`.
 *
 * VACUITY. Every way this gate could report success over nothing is an
 * explicit failure with a named reason: fewer crates discovered than the
 * published list, a crate whose `lib.rs` yields zero `pub use`/`pub` items,
 * or an ambiguous struct/enum name silently resolved instead of flagged.
 * None of those reads as a pass.
 *
 * SNAPSHOT KEY ORDER. Each crate's surface is written sorted by name, not in
 * `lib.rs` source order — a purely cosmetic reshuffle of `pub use` lines then
 * produces no diff in the committed snapshot at all, rather than a large
 * no-op one that obscures a real change sitting in the same PR. The
 * pass/fail comparison (`diffCrate`) is already order-independent, so this
 * affects only how the committed JSON reads on review, never the verdict.

of break that forced #4178's field to be reverted after cargo-semver-checks caught
it at release time (issue #4192). Decide BEFORE merging, not at release:

  - If this is safe (the type is not really constructed/matched externally, or the
    bump is deliberately a major): run \`pnpm rust-api-surface:update\`, commit the
    snapshot, and raise the crate's version by hand or via changeset as appropriate.
  - If it is NOT intentional, restore the previous shape or add
    \`#[non_exhaustive]\` to the type instead of adding to it directly.

This gate does not itself decide the bump — it only makes the choice visible where
it is still cheap. \`pnpm check:rust-semver\` remains the release-time authority.`);
