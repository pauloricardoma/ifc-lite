/**
 * Tests for `check-isolate-expansion-routing.mjs`'s pure `classifyFile`,
 * exercised against synthetic fixture strings (never the repo's own source
 * text -- `scripts/*.test.mjs` is explicitly out of
 * `check-source-text-assertions.mjs`'s scope for exactly this reason: this
 * file tests the GATE's classification logic on fabricated inputs, not an
 * application's behaviour through its own source).
 *
 * Both directions, per #3338's mechanism requirement:
 *   1. RED — a planted violation (an unlisted file calling isolateEntities(,
 *      and a listed-but-regressed file that lost its resolver call) is
 *      reported as a failure.
 *   2. GREEN — a compliant call site (routed, or allowlist-exempt with a
 *      reason) is not.
 *
 * A live, on-disk RED/GREEN proof (planting `PlantedIsolateViolation.tsx`,
 * and stripping `LensPanel.tsx`'s `resolveHighlightIds` call, restored by
 * SHA) was additionally run by hand against the real repo before this PR —
 * see the PR description for the transcript. This file is what keeps that
 * proof from rotting: it runs on every CI run, not once by hand.
