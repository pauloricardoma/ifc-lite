/** #4116: Playwright's close() can hang indefinitely — observed on both arms
 * of two independent large-fixture (1.26 GB) experiments — when the underlying
 * browser process does not exit cleanly. `await x.close().catch(...)` only
 * handles a *rejection*; an unresolved promise is neither resolved nor
 * rejected, so a hang there blocked the whole harness forever with no
 * diagnosis. Race close() against a deadline instead: on timeout, report it
 * as a loud, named failure and move on, rather than waiting indefinitely.
 * (Playwright's public `Browser`/`BrowserContext` API exposes no handle to
 * the underlying OS process from `chromium.launch()`, so this cannot also
 * force-kill it; the harness's own final `process.exit()` still terminates
 * the run itself even if a stuck browser process is left behind.) */

/** Races `promise` against `timeoutMs`; rejects with a named error on expiry
 * instead of leaving the caller waiting on a promise that never settles.
 * Exported so callers with the same class of unbounded-CDP-await risk (e.g.
 * `browser.newContext()` / `context.newPage()`, which Playwright's own
 * `BrowserContextOptions` expose no `timeout` for) can reuse the identical
 * bounding mechanism rather than re-implementing it. */
