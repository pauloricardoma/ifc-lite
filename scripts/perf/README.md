# Performance diagnosis kit

One place to answer "where does load time go, and what is the biggest lever?"
for both the **native** Rust pipeline (CLI/server/exporter) and the **WASM**
viewer path. The two run the *same* Rust code (`process_geometry` ->
`produce_element_meshes`), so native profiling finds the algorithmic hotspots
that also dominate in the browser; the WASM-only concerns (per-worker file
re-decode, no threads, memory bandwidth) are orchestration-level and are read
off the viewer's own telemetry (below).

## TL;DR

```bash
# per-phase parse-vs-geometry attribution across the heavy fixtures on disk:
scripts/perf/probe.sh --suite --census

# one fixture, more iterations, JSON for diffing runs:
scripts/perf/probe.sh tests/models/ara3d/schependomlaan.ifc --iters 5 --json > /tmp/a.json

# symbolized flamegraph (opens Firefox profiler) to see WHICH function:
scripts/perf/flame.sh tests/models/ara3d/schependomlaan.ifc
```

Fetch a fixture first if missing: `pnpm fixtures ara3d/schependomlaan.ifc`.

## The native probe (`perf_probe`)

`rust/processing/examples/perf_probe.rs`, wrapped by `probe.sh`. It drains the
timings the pipeline already publishes (`ProcessingStats`) plus an isolated
`build_entity_index` scan, best-of-N, and prints the split:

```
  parse (pre-geometry)   <ms>   <%>     <- single-threaded; gates time-to-first-geometry
    - index-scan alone   <ms>   <%>     <- isolated build_entity_index (structural scan)
    - entity_scan        <ms>   <%>     <- scan loop + job/quick-metadata building
    - lookup/styles      <ms>   <%>     <- style/material/void resolution
    - preprocess         <ms>   <%>     <- unit scales, RTC detect, site transforms
  geometry               <ms>   <%>     <- rayon-parallel; CSG-dominated on heavy models
    - faceted-brep       <ms>   <%>     <- only with OBS=1 (features observability)
  brep point-cache       <hits>/<misses> (<rate>% memoized)
  csg census             <subtract/union/intersect/clip> | <operand-tris>
```

Flags: `--suite` (all catalogued heavy fixtures on disk), `--iters N`,
`--census` (CSG op distribution), `--json` (stdout; table stays on stderr),
`OBS=1` env (build with `observability` to fill `faceted_brep_time_ms`).

Why `--profile profiling`: release-grade opt but keeps symbols and
`panic=unwind`, so `samply` gets a symbolized flamegraph and per-element
`catch_unwind` isolation still fires. (Plain `release` strips symbols;
`server-release` keeps unwind but strips.)

### Reading it

- **`parse` large** -> the win is in the **single-threaded** scan/decode path;
  it hits every model and is the time-to-first-geometry gate in the viewer.
- **`geometry` large** -> CSG/brep bound; check `csg census` operand-tris and the
  dead-end ledger below before touching the kernel.
- `index-scan alone` vs `entity_scan`: the gap is job-list + quick-metadata
  building layered on the raw scan.

## Flamegraph (`flame.sh`)

`samply record` on the profiling binary, opens the Firefox profiler. Click into
`ifc_lite_processing::...` for parse, `ifc_lite_geometry::kernel::...` for CSG.
Install once: `cargo install samply`.

## The WASM / viewer side

The browser can't use `std::time::Instant` (traps on wasm32), so parse phases
are timed in JS. Diagnose there with:

- **PostHog `ifc_model_loaded`** (project IFClite 199147): per-load milestones
  `file_read_ms, metadata_complete_ms, first_geometry_batch_ms,
  first_visible_geometry_ms, stream_complete_ms, total_elapsed_ms` + mesh/vert/tri
  counts. Emitted in `apps/viewer/src/hooks/useIfcLoader.ts`. This is the
  **user-facing** truth (time-to-first-paint, time-to-complete).
- **Console `[stream]` timeline** (`packages/geometry/src/geometry-parallel.ts`)
  and `[useIfc] TOTAL LOAD TIME` lines: `meta @`, `styles @`, `entity-index @`,
  worker-ready, first-batch. The CI benchmark scrapes these.
- **`?perfMem=1`** -> `memoryAccounting` `[mem-summary]` (JS heap, per-worker WASM
  heap, geometry bytes, transport bytes; `apps/viewer/src/lib/perf/memoryAccounting.ts`).
- **CI viewer benchmark** (`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`, advisory): 6 load
  milestones vs `tests/benchmark/baseline.json`, flags >50% regressions on a PR.
  Run locally: `pnpm test:benchmark:viewer:ci`; check:
  `node scripts/check-benchmark-regression.js --advisory`.
- **`?geomWorkers=N`** and `window.__ifc_lite_viewer_store__` for live poking.

WASM-specific structural cost (not in the native probe, by design):
- **Per-worker file re-decode**: each of N geometry workers re-decodes the whole
  file + rebuilds its own entity index (`packages/geometry/src/worker-count.ts`),
  the ~5x peak-memory driver. Worker count is memory-clamped, not CPU-bound
  (`SMALL_FILE_MB=24`, >512 MB caps to 3-4). More workers do **not** speed up
  CSG (memory-bandwidth bound) - see ledger.
- **No wasm threads in the live path**: `init_thread_pool` exists only in the
  `threads` bundle (off by default); cross-worker parallelism is the JS pool.

## Specialized harnesses (when the probe is too coarse)

| Tool | Question it answers |
|------|--------------------|
| `rust/processing/examples/csg_scaling_bench.rs` (`--features csg-capture`) | Does native CSG scale with cores? (captures + replays the void-cut corpus under 1/2/4/8 threads) |
| `rust/export/examples/glb_export_profile.rs` | GLB export phase split (index / mesh / assemble+serialize) + per-type triangle mass |
| `rust/csg-thread-bench/` (detached crate, `build.sh` + `web/serve.mjs`) | Threaded-WASM CSG: atomics tax + SharedArrayBuffer scaling in the browser |

## Lever ledger (read before spiking)

Encoded so a spike does not re-walk a dead end. History lives in the PRs cited.

### Shipped wins
- **CDT: kill the three O(T)-per-item scans**: ISSUE_129 geometry 1568 -> 646 ms
  (main, pre-seam-conform, is 979), **byte-identical output** on 8 fixtures incl.
  advanced_model (FNV over every mesh). The quality CDT — not the seam conform —
  was the whole cost of `consolidate_coplanar`; the conform's own work
  (`build_seam_map` + `conform_plans`) measures 20 of 1400 CDT cpu-ms, so
  "the conform is slow" was a mis-frame. What was actually slow, per instrumented
  slot-visit counts on one ISSUE_129 load:
  (1) `insert_steiner` renumbered every triangle to splice each Steiner point in
  below the super vertices — **1.07e9** index touches. Fixed by reserving the
  Steiner budget below the super verts at build time, so ids never move.
  (2) `edge_exists` re-scanned every triangle per constraint probe — **4.7e8**
  slot visits. Fixed by materialising the alive-edge set once in
  `enforce_constraints` and applying the flip delta (drop `u-w`, add `apex-q`).
  (3) `locate` was an O(T) canonical scan per inserted point — **2.2e8** slot
  visits. Fixed by a walk from the previous insertion that only answers when the
  triangle STRICTLY contains the point (unique ⇒ same answer as the scan) and
  falls back to the scan on the on-edge tie-break.
  Two smaller ones with the same shape: the encroachment test scanned all
  constraints per skinny candidate (5.9e7 disk tests -> a CSR grid built once per
  refinement), and `constraints` served millions of membership probes from a
  BTreeSet (now an FxHashSet mirror; the BTreeSet stays for the recovery ORDER,
  which is target-independence-critical).
  **Lesson:** all five are output-identical by construction, so the fix is
  measurement, not risk-taking — but only after instrumenting. The prior
  hypothesis chain (lazy seam map, x-range prune, CDT caching by clone/move) all
  measured ~zero because they targeted the 20 ms, not the 1400.
- **Fast first-geometry** (#1185): ship index/styles/first-wave at scan-complete;
  22s -> 11.8s wall to first paint. Overlap parse + geometry.
- **Faceted-brep dedup** (#1184) + **CartesianPoint cache hoist** (#1568/#1572):
  memoize shared points across parts; big win on steel/Tekla.
- **Local-frame f32 collapse** (#1114): per-element origin removes far-from-origin
  jitter and shrinks coordinates.
- **Worker right-sizing** (#1431): `SMALL_FILE_MB` 64->24, -21% peak, 0 regression.
- **Shared entity-index on the export/native path** (#1516/#1533, #1682): one sorted
  `(id,start,end)` binary-search buffer instead of per-worker FxHashMaps, where a
  *single* consumer builds it (streaming glTF export, binary-search columns). This
  shipped and is a real win; it is NOT the viewer huge-file case below (see dead ends).
- **Vertex weld at faceted-brep source** (#1562): closes the volume-metric gap.

### Dead ends (do NOT re-spike without a new mechanism)
- **More geometry workers** -> zero CSG speedup: memory-bandwidth bound, not CPU.
- **Shared entity-index for the VIEWER huge-file path** (#1445): CLOSED, branch
  deleted, REFUTED by an end-to-end 722MB re-measure. The retained-size spike looked
  great (152 vs 354 MB/worker, projected ~600 MB lower peak) but `peakWasm` went *up*
  ~680 MB (3930 vs 3250 MB): peak is set *during* the build, `from_columns`
  double-buffers a transient `Vec<(u32,u32,u32)>` + output `Vec<u8>`, and N workers
  building concurrently spike above the old single-FxHashMap footprint. Third
  isolated-bench-misled case after #1429 and Manifold. Do NOT re-attempt without a
  transient-free in-place build — and even then the index is not the dominant cost
  (the per-worker 1x source copy is). (The single-consumer export/native shared index
  above is a *different* thing and did ship.)
- **Threaded WASM CSG** (#1429): 4.19x CSG-only isolated, but whole-pipeline only
  2.33x @ 4 threads and it REGRESSED at 8 threads (atomics tax + SAB scaling). Second
  isolated-bench-misled case. `init_thread_pool` survives in the off-by-default
  `threads` bundle only; the live path is the JS worker pool.
- **Void-cut dedup** (#1286-P5 / #1571): ~4% eligible on real models (plan-rotated
  walls ineligible AND costliest); world-frame cut can't be byte-identical. PARKED.
- **Content-dedup** (#1130): hash re-decodes the subtree, 20-30% slower net. OFF.
  (It became a NET LOSS once rect_fast made CSG cheap — a "regime rot" example: a
  measured win can flip when the surrounding cost regime changes.)
- **Manifold WASM / BSP kernel**: deleted at M9; pure-Rust exact kernel is the only
  one. C++ accelerator was a dead end.
- **Rect-fast void path**: correct where it fires but barely fires (0 on Revit/Tekla);
  not the lever.
- **CSG exact-arith**: ~15ms/cut floor is the arithmetic cost; the only lever there
  is *doing fewer/cheaper cuts* (analytic bypass), not faster exact CSG.
- **`wasm-opt` for size**: a NET LOSS on the *shipped* (brotli-compressed) bundle —
  it grows the brotli-compressed transfer size even when it shrinks the raw `.wasm`.
  Track raw AND brotli, and gate on brotli (what the user downloads).
- **`bnum` fixed-width bigint** (bnum#74): OBSOLETE post-FixedInt; the -8.9% it once
  bought is now ~0%. Another regime-rot casualty.

### Cold-start / CSG levers — mixed status (read each label)
Entries below are tagged individually: CANDIDATE (measured once, not validated end-to-end),
SHIPPED (landed with a PR), or RE-REFUTED / NOT SHIPPABLE. Do not read the section as
"all unshipped".
- **Brotli -q11 on the served bundle** (CANDIDATE — unvalidated): a single local estimate
  suggested Vercel serves ~1266 KB where brotli -q11 reaches ~947 KB (~25% smaller cold
  download). NOT confirmed against the real served response — Vercel controls its own
  on-the-fly compression and may override a precompressed asset, so this may not be
  realizable without platform support. Before claiming it: measure the actual
  `Content-Encoding`/transfer size of the deployed `.wasm` before vs after, on a clean
  deploy. Treat the 25% as preliminary context only.
- **Parser worker's unused WASM compile** (SHIPPED, PR #1851): NOT the "compile outside
  the shared memo" this was first framed as. Verified: on the streaming cold-load path
  (`waitForEntityIndex`, every file >=2 MB) the parser worker eager-compiled the ~3.9 MB
  scanner and then NEVER USED IT — the geometry pre-pass hands over the entity index and
  `entity-scanner.ts` short-circuits before the wasm scan. So the compile was pure waste
  stealing a core from the concurrent pre-pass. Fix = defer the compile (eager only on
  the no-handoff path; lazy on the timeout fallback). Win = CPU-contention relief on the
  parse<->pre-pass overlap; shows on LOW-CORE devices, so read magnitude off the CI
  viewer benchmark / PostHog, not a fast dev machine. Lesson: the "shared compile memo"
  fix was a mis-frame — verify the code path before building the fix the research names.
- **Threaded WASM CSG — in-instance rayon** (RE-REFUTED end-to-end, measured
  2026-07-23; keep in the dead-end column): a fresh browser A/B on ISSUE_129 (the most
  CSG-heavy public model, 71% CSG) settles the old CONTESTED status against threading.
  The CSG *kernel* really does parallelize in WASM (corpus replay 4152 -> 1724 ms,
  **2.41x**), but the **full pipeline REGRESSED**: plain single-thread 6450 ms vs
  threaded-8T 7383 ms = **0.87x** (byte-identical, fp=1402). The atomics tax on the
  serial parse/decode majority (2298 -> 5659 ms, ~2.5x slower) exceeds the CSG savings.
  ISSUE_129 is the *best* case, so lighter models are worse. This vindicates #1429 and
  supersedes the `docs/architecture/csg-threading-design.md` rung-2 "1.6-1.9x
  end-to-end" numbers, which have regime-rotted (see below). Do NOT wire `pkg-threaded`
  without first defeating the whole-pipeline atomics tax (not just the CSG step).
  Data: `csg-thread-bench` build.sh was itself broken (missing shared-memory link args)
  and never booted the threaded bundle until fixed in this PR.
- **Regime rot: CSG is no longer the universal bottleneck.** Native capture 2026-07-23
  (`csg_scaling_bench`): the *expensive-CSG* corpus has collapsed 10-160x vs the
  threading-doc era as the fast paths (rect_fast, analytic bypass, faceted-brep dedup)
  matured. advanced_model CSG = **4%** of load (13/316 ms; doc: 103 jobs/26 s), dental
  32%, ISSUE_068 33%, ISSUE_129 71%. The dominant cost on the majority of models is now
  the **single-threaded parse/prepass/decode/extrude path** (advanced_model 96% non-CSG),
  which gates time-to-first-geometry and hits every model — that, not CSG threading, is
  where the next real speedup lives.
- **Wide-arithmetic exact-CSG bundle** (~1.7x on a real void cut — NOT SHIPPABLE TODAY):
  built by `BUILD_WIDE=1 scripts/build-wasm.sh`, but **V8 does not run it**. Measured
  2026-07-31 on V8 (Node 22 / V8 12.4 and Node 26.5.1 / V8 14.6): a module using
  every wide op the bundle emits fails `WebAssembly.validate`, compiling it throws
  `invalid numeric opcode: 0xfc13`, and `node --v8-options` lists **no**
  wide-arithmetic flag under any name. An earlier
  entry here claimed V8 had it behind a default-off
  `--experimental-wasm-wide-arithmetic`; that flag has never existed, so do NOT wait
  for it to be "staged" — there is nothing to stage. Firefox (SpiderMonkey) and Safari
  (JavaScriptCore) were not measured; treat them as unverified, not as rejecting.
  Track-and-adopt only; the runtime feature-probe
  (`packages/geometry/src/wasm-features.ts`, not yet created) would auto-upgrade per engine
  as each ships. The CI tripwire (`.github/workflows/wide-arithmetic.yml`) probes the
  engine every week and turns red when this changes. See
  `docs/architecture/wasm-wide-arithmetic.md` (delivery status verified 2026-07-31).

- **Content-dedup signature walk on large single BREPs** (~2.00x traversal, SHIPPED #1909):
  `item_dedup_key` walked every face/bound/loop/point of an `IfcFacetedBrep` to build a
  dedup key — a second full traversal mirroring the mesher's own. On a model that is one
  large BREP with no repeats, that key can never pay off. Gated on
  `FACETED_BREP_DEDUP_FACE_LIMIT` (20,000 faces), measured with a **deterministic counter**
  (`EntityDecoder::point_cache_stats()`), not wall-clock: 5,880,000 accesses with dedup on
  vs 2,940,000 with it off on a synthetic 980k-face BREP — exactly 2.00x — and 1.00x after.
  Post-mesh `get_or_cache_by_hash` and `direct_rep_identity` still run, so genuinely repeated
  large geometry still dedups and still instances (asserted by test).
  **Lesson, and the reason this entry exists:** an end-to-end suite verdict **cannot be
  produced for this lever on the current corpus.** The largest BREP across all 163 fixtures
  is 8,848 faces, so nothing in the suite crosses a 20,000-face gate; a base-vs-branch A/B
  swung -10%/+9%/-7% with the sign tracking run order, i.e. pure noise. Do not spend another
  afternoon on `probe.sh --suite` for a threshold this corpus cannot reach — either add a
  fixture above the gate, or measure with a deterministic counter as above. The 20,000 figure
  is a judgement call (an order of magnitude clear of realistic repeated parts, which run to
  low hundreds of faces), not a measured optimum.

### Measured feature costs (not levers — recorded so nobody re-measures)
- **Geometry fingerprint pass: world AABB + volume + closure verdict**
  (#1891/#1988, PR #1993, measured 2026-08-02, base = merge-base `8f139a8e`).
  The pass gained a per-triangle tetra determinant and a six-way bounds update.
  Verdict: **hashing OFF is unaffected, hashing ON costs a fraction of a
  percent.** Output byte-identical throughout — mesh/vertex/triangle counts
  unchanged on every fixture, and an FNV-1a over every `geometryHashValues`
  entry is equal base-vs-branch on all three (so the new arrays did not perturb
  the fingerprint they ride with).
  - Native `probe.sh --iters 5`, interleaved rounds, hashing off (the only mode
    the native pipeline has — see the harness gap below): AC20-FZK-Haus
    10 -> 10 ms total; ISSUE_129 median-of-6-rounds +1.4% inside a ±10%
    round-to-round band (per-round minima 683..984 ms on base alone);
    Holter/ISSUE_053 977 -> 967 ms (-1.0%). No signal either way.
  - WASM boundary (`buildPrePassOnce` + `processGeometryBatch` in node, 3
    interleaved rounds), min ms base -> branch: AC20 off 49.0 -> 49.1 (+0.2%),
    on 50.1 -> 50.5 (+0.8%); ISSUE_129 off 1983.9 -> 1987.9 (+0.2%), on
    1989.0 -> 1999.4 (+0.5%); Holter off 3555.7 -> 3600.1 (+1.2%), on
    3790.6 -> 3849.8 (+1.6%).
  - Turning the SWITCH on is the real cost, and it is the same on both sides:
    off -> on is +2.9%/+0.6%/+6.9% on branch versus +2.2%/+0.3%/+6.6% on base,
    i.e. this PR adds ~0.3-0.7 pp to a surcharge that only the diff feature pays.
  - Honest outlier: hashing-off on Holter reads +1.2% at the wasm boundary while
    the native probe on the same fixture reads -1.0%. Nothing in the
    hashing-off path changed — the hasher is `None`, so every new accumulator is
    dead code — and the delta sits inside the base's own 3528..3584 ms spread,
    so read it as the 3.7 KB binary-size / code-layout shift, not added work.
  - **Harness gap, worth fixing before the next hashing change:** `perf_probe`
    CANNOT reach the hashing path. `process_geometry` -> `processor/jobs.rs`
    hardcodes `MeshProductionOptions::default()`, so `geometry_hash` is always
    `None` natively and the fingerprint pass only exists behind
    `IfcAPI::setComputeGeometryHashes`. The hashing-on numbers above therefore
    come from driving the real wasm entry point, not from `probe.sh`.

- **Second harness gap, same shape: `probe.sh` cannot reach the SYMBOLIC path
  either** (found on #2358, 2026-08-11). `perf_probe` drives `process_geometry`,
  which never populates `symbolic_data`; annotation/placement work hangs off a
  separate entry point, `extract_symbolic_data`, called by the wasm binding and
  the server. So a symbolic-only change produces a **flat, identical probe table
  on both sides** — which reads exactly like "no regression" but is a control,
  not a measurement. If the diff is under `rust/processing/src/symbolic/`, say so
  and drive `extract_symbolic_data` directly, rather than pasting a zero.
  - **And pick the fixture by whether it exercises the branch, not by the default.**
    #2358 only does extra work when a symbolic rep's `ContextOfItems` is a full
    `IfcGeometricRepresentationContext`. The default fixture AC20-FZK-Haus has
    **zero** such reps (all 34 are SubContext) and C20-Institute zero of 316;
    `dental_clinic.ifc` has **1080**. Scan the corpus for the shape your diff
    touches before measuring, or the "canonical" fixture will confirm nothing.
  - Related trap when reading byte-identity on this path: **every WCS in the
    corpus is the identity**, which is precisely why the #2358 bug survived —
    resolving it correctly and never resolving it agree on every shipped fixture.
    Identical output there is evidence about the corpus, not about the change.

### Reading the FIELD telemetry (PostHog) — verdicts and traps

- **A per-model PostHog regression alert is device-mix noise until you control for
  device — and at this traffic level it CANNOT be made to control for device**
  (2026-08-08, alert "Per-model load regression — any model >2x baseline").
  It fired at `x_change = 2.29` on one fingerprint (76.7 MB / 6668 meshes,
  14406 -> 32994 ms median). It is **NOT a regression.**
  - The decisive estimator is the **within-person same-model paired ratio**:
    for every (person, model) cell with loads in both windows, `median(recent) /
    median(baseline)`. Fleet-wide that is **0.927** (IQR 0.852-1.127) over 24
    cells / 16 persons / 97 loads — i.e. slightly *faster*. This holds the device
    constant by construction, which is the only property that matters here.
  - The fingerprint that fired has **zero** paired persons: 11 loads in 90 days by
    10 different people, no person in both windows. Its paired ratio is not
    small, it is **undefined** — there was never a regression estimate, only a
    comparison of one set of laptops against another.
  - **A per-model alert is not salvageable at current volume.** Across the whole
    17-day window, **no** model fingerprint has more than **one** paired person
    (24 fingerprints have exactly 1, 1825 have 0). Any per-model gate strong
    enough to be sound can never fire. Alert **fleet-wide** on the pooled paired
    ratio and keep per-model as a drill-down insight.
  - **Two tempting controls that are circular — do not lean on them.** (1)
    Normalising each load by that person's own median ms/MB *over the full
    window* looks great (it collapses 2.29x to 1.00x) but the divisor is computed
    from inside the suspect window, so a real uniform 2x regression normalises to
    ~1.4x and a person whose only loads are recent cancels out by construction.
    If you normalise, build the divisor from the **baseline window only**.
    (2) "The one person who loaded it on both recent builds got faster" compares
    two *recent* builds to each other and never bridges the windows.
  **Lesson:** the alert's anti-false-positive gates (>=5 loads, >=3 persons per
  window, recent p25 >= baseline median) are all satisfiable by five loads from
  five *different* laptops. Person count is not person *overlap*. This is the
  second retracted field perf claim on this project (see the #2183 "compression
  is worse" retraction) — both died to contaminated measurement, not to bad code.
- **A `total_triangles` change for one file can split WITHIN a single build.**
  On the fingerprint above, build `1aa498e26339` emitted **both** 4423296 (two
  persons) and 4432196 (a third) — same file, same `mesh_count` (6668), same
  `file_size_mb` to 2dp. Because the split is inside one build, every
  commit-range / "which merge changed the mesher" argument is moot, and so is
  fingerprint collision (it would need two files matching to +-5 KB and +-0
  meshes while differing 0.2% in triangles). An identical mesh roster with more
  triangles distributed *within* it means **environment-conditional
  triangulation on a deterministic code path** — most plausibly a CSG void cut
  that failed and fell back under memory pressure on one run. Note the CI
  determinism manifests would **not** catch this (pinned fixtures, controlled
  memory), so if CSG fallback is the mechanism it is known-by-design variance,
  not a latent determinism defect. `total_csg_failures` now rides
  `ifc_model_loaded` so this is answerable from telemetry. Do **not** spend a
  probe on `?geomWorkers=N`: `useIfcLoader.ts` documents that worker count cannot
  affect output (disjoint deterministic element slices), so that probe is
  predicted clean by the codebase itself.
- **`total_elapsed_ms` is not pure compute — it contained an unbounded hidden-tab
  stall** (#2385, fixed). `useIfcLoader` awaited a bare `requestAnimationFrame`
  at stream-complete; rAF is never serviced while the document is hidden, so a
  tabbed-away load parked there indefinitely. Field evidence: 30 days of loads
  contain a 25-hour and a 3.4-hour `total_elapsed_ms`, and 20 loads over 60 s of
  post-stream time on models under 5000 meshes — durations no amount of finalize
  work can produce. 5.5% of all loads (420 / 7605) spent over 10 s after
  `stream_complete_ms`. **When mining this event, treat `total_elapsed_ms` minus
  `stream_complete_ms` above ~30 s as a visibility artifact, not compute, on any
  data captured before this fix.** That duration cut is a stopgap and has a real
  cost — it also hides a genuine slow-finalize regression. `ifc_model_loaded` now
  carries **`was_hidden`**; once it has 17 days of history, filter on
  `was_hidden != true` instead, which excludes the artifact without blinding the
  metric.
- **`BVH.build` is a synchronous main-thread block that grows as O(N log^2 N)**
  (`packages/spatial/src/bvh.ts`, measured 2026-08-08, M-series, warmed, best of
  3): 21 ms @ 6.7k meshes, 296 ms @ 60k, 826 ms @ 120k, **1715 ms @ 200k**
  (3-5x that on a mid-range laptop). `buildSpatialIndexAsync` time-slices only
  phase 1 (the linear bounds pass) and calls phase 2 "fast enough
  synchronously"; phase 2 re-`sort()`s the index slice at *every* node, so the
  comparator runs 68 -> 132 times per mesh as N goes 6.7k -> 200k. NOT SHIPPED and
  not the cause of any open issue — recorded so the number does not get
  re-measured. The fix, if wanted, is a presorted-per-axis build (O(N log N))
  plus slicing phase 2; BVH query results are exact AABB tests at the leaves, so
  a different tree shape is output-equivalent and can be asserted as such.

### Standing constraints
- Geometry is **client-side only** (no server meshing).
- One mesh home: `produce_element_meshes` - a fix in one pipeline diverges the other.
- Parity gates: `mesh_determinism` manifests (x86_64 + arm64 + wasm32),
  `styling_parity`, `exact_predicate_determinism`. A real output change re-pins them.
