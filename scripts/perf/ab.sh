# Interleaved base-vs-branch native perf A/B on the perf_probe phases.
#
# The single most common perf mistake in this repo is measuring a "win" that is
# machine drift or a contaminated artifact (see scripts/perf/README.md, the
# failure-mode ledger). This tool exists so an agent can produce a *trustworthy*
# base-vs-branch delta with one command:
#
#   - It builds perf_probe from BOTH a base ref and the working tree.
#   - It runs them INTERLEAVED, one round per iteration, so a machine that
#     slows down mid-run drags BOTH sides equally instead of faking a delta.
#     Within each round, which side runs FIRST is balanced and randomized
#     across rounds (scripts/perf/ab-order.mjs) rather than always
#     base-then-branch — a fixed order lets any penalty tied to position
#     (not identity) survive interleaving and read as a confident delta on
#     two byte-identical builds (#4221).
#   - It reports per-phase median + spread and refuses a verdict when the base's
#     OWN run-to-run spread is too wide (the machine is too noisy to trust).
#   - It fingerprints mesh/vertex/triangle counts so a "faster" run that changed
#     the output is flagged, not celebrated.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/perf/ab.sh tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc
#   scripts/perf/ab.sh /abs/path/model.ifc --iters 7 --base origin/main
#   scripts/perf/ab.sh a.ifc b.ifc --iters 5      # several fixtures
#
# Flags:
#   --base <ref>   git ref to treat as "before" (default: merge-base with
#                  origin/main, else HEAD~1). The working tree — INCLUDING
#                  uncommitted changes — is "after".
#   --iters <N>    interleaved rounds per side (default 5). Higher = less noise.
#   --json <path>  also write the machine-readable report to <path>.
#
# Notes:
#   - Fixture paths are resolved to ABSOLUTE and both binaries run from the repo
#     root, so the base build (a throwaway worktree that lacks fetched fixtures)
#     still reads the same on-disk file. Fetch fixtures first: `pnpm fixtures …`.
#   - Uses the `profiling` cargo profile (release-grade opt + symbols), same as
#     probe.sh, so the numbers are comparable to a flamegraph run.

# round (thermal ramp, a cache state left by the preceding process, a
# frequency step on the first process after idle) — whichever side always
# runs first pays that every round, and it survives the median like a real
# regression would (#4221). ab-order.mjs decides, per invocation, which side
# runs first each round: balanced across rounds (as close to half base-first
# / half branch-first as ITERS allows) and randomly assigned to specific
# rounds, so a fixed positional penalty lands on both sides roughly equally
# often and cancels out instead of accumulating on one.
