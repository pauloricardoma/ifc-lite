# B1.3 spike + B2.5 follow-up: exact orient3d and incircle on WebGPU

Spike for M6c (docs/vision/moonshots-tech.md) / B1.3 (docs/vision/moonshots-execution-plan.md),
extended by B2.5 (encode-bottleneck attack + incircle; see section 9). No CSG
integration, no `rust/` or `packages/` changes. This directory is self-contained:

- B1.3 (sections 1-8): `reference.mjs` (CPU exact oracle + CPU encoder),
  `orient3d.wgsl` (GPU exact kernel, CPU-encoded inputs), `harness.mjs`
  (Playwright-driven browser runner that does both and compares).
- B2.5 (section 9): `predicates-raw.wgsl` (GPU kernels taking RAW f64 bits:
  decode, exponent frame, D_MAX gate, and both predicates fully on-GPU),
  `harness-b25.mjs` (runner for the new paths), plus additions to
  `reference.mjs` (incircle BigInt oracle, BigInt-free fast CPU encoder).
  The B1.3 files are untouched so the original baseline stays reproducible.

## 1. Why floats can't just be uploaded to the GPU

`geometry-predicates` on CPU (Shewchuk adaptive) and this repo's own fixed-width
tier (`rust/geometry/src/kernel/fixed.rs`) both work by escalating to exact
integer/rational arithmetic whenever a floating filter can't certify the sign.
WGSL has neither `f64` nor `i64` — only `f32`/`i32`/`u32` — so neither the
adaptive floating filter (needs f64 to even be a meaningful improvement over
f32) nor the CPU fixed-width tier (built on `bnum` `I256..I2048`, a Rust crate
with no WGSL equivalent) can be ported directly. The only path to an EXACT sign
on today's WebGPU is: do all arithmetic in emulated multi-limb integers built
out of `u32`, and never let a floating-point rounding step anywhere near the
sign decision.

## 2. The exactness argument

Every finite IEEE-754 double `x` decomposes bit-exactly as `x = S * 2^E` where
`S` is a signed integer (53-bit magnitude for normals — the implicit leading 1
plus the 52-bit mantissa — or up to 52-bit for subnormals) and `E` is an
integer exponent (`E ∈ [-1074, 971]` over the whole finite double range). This
decomposition is exact bit manipulation (mask/shift on the IEEE bit pattern),
not arithmetic — there is no rounding step here, at all magnitudes, including
subnormals and zero.

`orient3d(a, b, c, d)` is the sign of a 3x3 determinant of coordinate
differences (`a-d`, `b-d`, `c-d` as rows). This determinant is a homogeneous
degree-3 polynomial in the twelve input coordinates. **A single shared positive
scale factor applied to every one of the twelve coordinates multiplies the
determinant by that factor cubed — sign unchanged.** That is the entire trick:
if we can re-express all twelve doubles as `S_i * 2^(E_i - e_min)` for one
shared `e_min = min(E_i)` (so every rescaled value is `x_i / 2^e_min`, an
*exact* non-negative-shift integer, no rounding — shifting a bit pattern left
by a non-negative amount never drops bits), the sign of the determinant of the
twelve integers `S_i * 2^(E_i - e_min)` equals the sign of the real determinant
of the twelve doubles. From there it's finite-precision but otherwise ordinary
integer subtraction/multiplication/addition — each of which is exact as long
as the working register is wide enough to hold the true result without
truncation (see width budget below). **No step on the sign-decision path ever
rounds**: the frexp-style decomposition is exact, the common-exponent shift is
an exact left-shift, and every big-integer add/sub/mul below is computed at a
width proven wide enough that truncation never actually discards a nonzero bit.

This is *conceptually* the same trick the CPU fixed-width tier already uses
(uniform positive scaling preserves orientation sign — see the module comment
in `fixed.rs`), generalized from "coordinates pre-snapped to a `k/2^16` grid"
to "any finite IEEE double, decomposed on the fly."

### Where this differs from Shewchuk's expansion arithmetic

Shewchuk's adaptive predicates keep sums as non-overlapping floating-point
*expansions* (arbitrary-length, no shared base) and only look at as many
components as needed to certify a sign. That is the right design on a CPU
with fast f64 FMA and branch prediction. On a SIMT GPU, per-lane data-dependent
expansion lengths are exactly the kind of divergence that kills throughput.
Fixed-width multi-limb integers over a common exponent frame trade a bit of
wasted arithmetic (every lane always does the same amount of work, sized for
the worst case the frame allows) for zero control-flow divergence, which is
the right trade for SIMT. This spike picks fixed-width integers over
expansions for that reason, not because expansions are impossible in WGSL.

## 3. The shared-exponent frame is per-test, not per-batch

The task brief says "quantize the batch to a shared exponent frame." This
spike interprets "batch" as **the twelve coordinates of one orient3d
evaluation**, not as one frame shared across an entire multi-million-item
dispatch. Rationale: real geometry queries in one dispatch are not required to
share a coordinate-magnitude regime (a dispatch can freely mix a
building-scale query against a millimeter-scale detail query elsewhere in the
model), so a single dispatch-wide frame would force the width budget to cover
the *worst* exponent spread anywhere in the whole batch, penalizing every
other item in it. A per-test frame keeps the width requirement tied to the
actual local dynamic range of that one predicate, which is the only quantity
that determines whether the sign is representable at a given fixed width.

The frame parameters (`e_min`, per-coordinate shift, and the resulting spread
`D`) are computed **on the CPU** (trivial bit manipulation, O(1) per point) and
uploaded as pre-shifted magnitude+sign integers; the GPU only ever does the
big-integer arithmetic, never any floating-point decoding. This mirrors the
CPU cascade's own structure: a cheap CPU-side filter step decides applicability
before the expensive exact tier runs.

## 4. Input-domain limit: exponent spread cap `D_MAX = 100`

- Per coordinate, decomposed magnitude is at most 53 bits (normal) or 52 bits
  (subnormal).
- Per test, `D = max(E_i) - min(E_i)` over the twelve nonzero-valued
  coordinates (an all-zero coordinate contributes no exponent constraint — its
  integer value is exactly zero at any shift).
- **If `D > D_MAX = 100`, the test is flagged for CPU fallback and is never
  sent through the GPU arithmetic path.** This is a hard gate evaluated on the
  CPU before upload; a flagged item never occupies a GPU lane and never
  produces a sign at all from the GPU side — there is no "compute anyway and
  hope," which is the failure mode the task explicitly rules out ("CPU
  fallback flag per item, NOT wrong signs").
- `D_MAX = 100` covers a coordinate-magnitude ratio of `2^100 ≈ 1.27e30`
  within one predicate — vastly larger than any realistic single-scene
  dynamic range (even "1 nanometer feature next to a 10,000 km georeferenced
  coordinate" is only ~2^53). It is chosen generously relative to real
  geometry so the fallback rate on realistic inputs is ~0%, while still being
  a hard, provable, checked limit — not an approximation.
- Genuinely extreme constructions (subnormals mixed with O(1) magnitudes,
  which spread by up to ~1074 bits; or one coordinate at `DBL_MAX` next to one
  near `DBL_MIN`) are used in the adversarial battery specifically to confirm
  the cap fires and routes to fallback rather than silently computing a wrong
  sign.

     its near-coincidence with the significand width is arithmetic rather than
     derivation. An earlier revision of that line read ~2^63, which the
     arithmetic does not support. -->

## 5. Width budget (why 512-bit two's-complement-free sign-magnitude is enough)

Let `W = 53 + D_MAX = 153` bits (worst-case magnitude of a single shifted
input coordinate). Bound the magnitude of each computation stage
conservatively (every `+1` below is slack for the sign-magnitude subtraction
worst case, where two same-magnitude opposite-sign values effectively add):

| stage | operation | magnitude bound |
|---|---|---|
| input (shifted) | — | `W` = 153 |
| row difference (`a-d` etc.) | subtract | `W+1` = 154 |
| 2x2 minor term | multiply two differences | `2(W+1)` = 308 |
| 2x2 minor | subtract two such products | `2(W+1)+1` = 309 |
| final triple term | multiply a difference by a minor | `(W+1)+(2(W+1)+1)` = 463 |
| final sum | ± three such terms | `463+2` = 465 |

465 bits of true magnitude, plus one bit of margin for the sign-magnitude
representation (no two's-complement wraparound to worry about — see §6), fits
comfortably inside a **512-bit (16 × u32 limb) working register**, with 47
bits of headroom to spare. Input coordinates are stored compactly in 5 limbs
(160 bits, enough for the 153-bit worst case) and zero-extended to 16 limbs on
load. Every multiply and add/subtract in the shader operates at the fixed
16-limb width; truncating a schoolbook product to 16 limbs is *exact* here
(not an approximation) because the proof above shows the true result never
exceeds 465 bits — the discarded upper limbs are provably always zero for any
test that passed the `D_MAX` gate.

**Known inefficiency, not fixed in this spike:** every multiply is a full
16x16-limb schoolbook (256 `u32×u32→u64` partial products), even though most
operands only have their low 5-13 limbs nonzero (the rest is zero-padding).
The CPU cascade avoids this by tiering width (I256 tried before I512/I1024);
a real GPU predicate library (B2.5/B3.4) would do the same — pick the
narrowest limb count that covers the test's actual `D`, branching per lane or
per workgroup. This spike deliberately skips that optimization to keep the
shader small and the correctness argument easy to audit; see §7 for the
resulting throughput hit.

     it appears on, from `W` = 153 and the stated rule (W+1, 2(W+1), 2(W+1)+1,
     463+2), and 512 / 16 limbs / 47 spare bits / 256 partial products follow
     from that. A register width is a design decision, not a measurement, and no
     battery report emits one. -->

## 6. Representation: sign-magnitude, not two's complement

The shader represents every big integer as `{ mag: array<u32,16>, neg: bool }`
rather than two's complement. Two's complement makes add/subtract a single
ripple-carry pass (an advantage this spike does not need, since add/sub is a
small fraction of the work), but it makes *multiply* fiddly (need a correct
truncated-negate-multiply-renegate dance to avoid the upper sign-extension
limbs contaminating the schoolbook product). Sign-magnitude makes the
multiply trivial and correct by construction (multiply the two non-negative
magnitude arrays — zero-padded limbs contribute exactly zero to every partial
product, no sign-extension fill to reason about — then XOR the signs), at the
cost of slightly more branching in add/subtract (compare-then-subtract-smaller-
from-larger). Given multiplies dominate the per-test cost (9 full 16x16
multiplies vs. a handful of O(16) adds), this trade favors sign-magnitude for
this spike.

`u32×u32→u64` itself has no native WGSL primitive (no `u64`), so it is built
from the standard 16-bit-limb split identity `a*b = ah*bh*2^32 +
(ah*bl+al*bh)*2^16 + al*bl` with explicit carry propagation between the three
partial-product groups (`mul32` in `orient3d.wgsl`). This exact primitive is
unit-tested against JS `BigInt` for a battery of edge-case 32-bit operand
pairs (all-ones, alternating bits, zero, max value) before the harness trusts
it for the full battery — see harness.mjs's `selfTestMul32` step and the
report's "self-test" section.

## 7. Honest scope boundary / what would break this

- **NaN / Infinity inputs are out of scope.** Geometry never legitimately
  produces them as coordinates; the CPU-side decomposition does not attempt
  to classify them specially and they are excluded from the battery. A
  production version would reject or fallback-flag them explicitly.
- **The per-test frame, not per-batch, means each GPU lane does independent
  CPU-precomputed shift work; this spike does not attempt a fully on-GPU
  decode-from-raw-f64-bits path** (WGSL has no `f64` type to even receive raw
  doubles — inputs must already be `u32`-encoded before upload, which is why
  the CPU-side decomposition step is unavoidable in *any* WGSL scheme, not a
  shortcut specific to this one). **[RETRACTED by B2.5: §9.2 candidate 1 —
  the raw-bits path uploads the untouched f64 bit patterns as `vec2<u32>`
  and decodes/frames/gates ON the GPU, eliminating the CPU decomposition;
  see `predicates-raw.wgsl` and the B2.5 harness.]**
- **This is stage 1 (orient3d) only.** incircle, the rational escalation tier,
  and the `ImplicitPoint`/LPI/TPI configurations from `kernel/predicates.rs`
  are all out of scope; a real library would need all of them plus a policy
  for what happens to a whole CSG operation when one lane in a batch
  fallback-flags (this spike's answer — "that one lane's sign is simply not
  produced by the GPU path, full stop" — composes fine at the single-predicate
  level but a real integration needs to decide how a batched *op* handles a
  partial fallback; not addressed here).

## 8. Result summary (filled in after running the battery)

Full numbers, mismatch samples, and the environment (real Apple M4, Metal-3
WebGPU backend, hardware-accelerated per `chrome://gpu`) are in `report.json`,
produced by `node harness.mjs --phase=all`. Headline:

- **Self-tests** (against JS `BigInt` ground truth): `mul32` (the `u32*u32→u64`
  primitive), 59 cases, 0 mismatches. 512-bit schoolbook `magMul`, 22 cases
  (including all-`0xFFFFFFFF` operands), 0 mismatches.
- **Correctness battery**: 1,500,009 cases checked against the CPU exact
  BigInt reference (random-uniform at three magnitude scales, 1-ulp coplanar
  perturbations, last-significand-bit differences, exact/negative zeros,
  collinear degeneracies), **0 mismatches**. 506 cases (subnormals mixed with
  O(1) magnitudes, and exponent spreads deliberately constructed past
  `D_MAX`) correctly fallback-flagged rather than computed wrong. The
  `D_MAX` boundary itself is exact: `D=100` valid and sign-matching,
  `D=101/120/300` correctly flagged.
- **Throughput** (GPU dispatch+readback only, vs. single-thread CPU exact
  `BigInt`, the fair "real CPU exact path" baseline per the task brief):
  15.3x at 1e5, 29.6x at 1e6, 31.0x at 1e7 — **clears the >= 10x gate**, and
  the ratio grows with batch size (fixed per-dispatch overhead amortizes).
- **The honest caveat**: including this spike's CPU-side shared-exponent-
  frame *encode* step (single-threaded JS `BigInt`, not yet moved to the
  GPU or parallelized) in the GPU-path wall-clock collapses the win to only
  ~1.3-1.4x over the CPU baseline — encode, not the exact arithmetic, is
  today's true end-to-end bottleneck. See §7's already-flagged scope
  boundary: this spike deliberately kept the frame computation CPU-side;
  making it fast (parallel encode, or a partial GPU-side bit-decode from
  raw f64 halves) is real, identified follow-up work, not solved here.
- **Verdict**: the spike gate ("batched orientation predicates on WebGPU
  with sign-exact agreement vs CPU on random + adversarial near-degenerate
  inputs, >= 10x throughput") **passes** on the predicate-throughput metric
  the task specifies. It passes as a systems-research result establishing
  the technique works and is sign-exact, not as a claim that today's
  unoptimized single-threaded-CPU-encode pipeline is already a 10x win
  end-to-end for a real caller — that gap is real, disclosed, and left for
  B2.5/B3.4 to close.

## 9. B2.5 follow-up: the encode bottleneck is closed, and incircle is in

Everything in this section was measured on the same machine and stack as
section 8 (Apple M4, Metal-3 WebGPU adapter, real Chrome via Playwright's
`chrome` channel, headed, `--enable-unsafe-webgpu`; all generation, CPU
references, and dispatch inside the page). Raw numbers live in
`report.b25.*.json`, produced by `node harness-b25.mjs --phase=<phase>`.

### 9.1 Baseline reproduction

Re-running the untouched B1.3 harness (`node harness.mjs --phase=throughput
--sizes=100000,1000000`, 2026-07-24) reproduced section 8's caveat exactly:
at n=1e6, encode 1731 ms + GPU 146 ms vs CPU BigInt 2523 ms, i.e. **1.34x
end-to-end** (GPU arithmetic alone 17x in that run). One methodology note
uncovered while reproducing: harness.mjs's first dispatch pays pipeline
compilation (~290 ms), which is visible in the 1e5 row when the throughput
phase runs alone; harness-b25.mjs therefore runs explicit warmup dispatches
on every pipeline before any timed region.

### 9.2 What was built

Three candidates from section 8's follow-up list, in the order that killed
the bottleneck:

1. **GPU-side bit-decode (the winner, "path C").** Section 7 claimed the
   CPU-side decomposition step was "unavoidable in any WGSL scheme" because
   WGSL has no f64. That claim confused *receiving doubles* with *receiving
   the bits of doubles*. The caller reinterprets its `Float64Array` as a
   `Uint32Array` (zero copies, zero arithmetic) and uploads raw IEEE-754
   halves; `predicates-raw.wgsl` does the frexp decomposition, the per-test
   shared exponent frame, the D_MAX gate, and the mantissa shifts entirely
   in integer WGSL. A gated lane (NaN/Inf or D > 100) writes the sentinel
   sign 2 instead of computing - fallback-not-wrong is preserved, it just
   moved to the GPU. Upload also shrinks 3x (96 B/test vs 288 B/test).
2. **BigInt-free CPU encode ("path B", `encodeTestFast`).** Same output
   words as `encodeTest`, using only 32-bit integer ops on the IEEE halves.
   Verified word-for-word identical on 330,016 cases including NaN/Inf,
   subnormals, DBL_MAX, mixed specials, and the exact D_MAX boundary
   (`--phase=encodecheck`, 0 mismatches). 7.6x faster than the BigInt
   encoder in Node, 5.4x inside Chrome (319 ms vs 1731 ms per 1e6). Kept as
   the fallback story for callers that need CPU-side encoding; obsoleted for
   the main GPU path by candidate 1.
3. **Length-aware multiply (narrow-limb tiering, per-lane).** Instead of
   per-lane width *branching* into separate kernels, `magMul` in the new
   kernel scans both operands' true limb lengths and loops only that far.
   Typical differences at small per-test D have 2-3 significant limbs, so
   the schoolbook shrinks from 16x16=256 partial products to ~tens. Lanes
   diverge only as far as their limb lengths differ (magnitude-coherent
   batches: barely). This more than pays for the wider 20-limb container
   the unified kernel uses (see 9.3): the new kernel's full pipeline is
   *faster* than the old 16-limb one despite also doing the decode.

The worker-parallelized-encode candidate was not implemented: with encode
gone from the pipeline entirely, there is nothing left for workers to
parallelize on the main path (it would only multiply path B's 5.4x).

     of the two encodings, format constants fixed by the WGSL. -->

### 9.3 incircle and the unified width budget

`incircleRaw` computes the standard lifted 3x3 determinant (sign of d
against the circle through a,b,c), matching the new BigInt oracle
`incircleSignBigInt` in `reference.mjs`. It is homogeneous of degree 4 in
the coordinate differences, so the shared positive frame scale preserves
the sign exactly as the degree-3 argument in section 2 does for orient3d.

Width budget at D_MAX = 100 (magnitudes strictly below 2^k): input 2^153,
difference 2^154, square 2^308, lift (sum of two squares) 2^309, row term
2^618, three-term determinant 2^620. Both predicates therefore share one
**20-limb (640-bit)** sign-magnitude working width in `predicates-raw.wgsl`
(orient3d only needs 465 bits; the length-aware multiply makes the extra
container limbs nearly free). Truncation to 20 limbs is exact for gated
inputs, same argument as section 5.

<!-- numeral-ok: 618, 620, 330,016 :: 2^618 and 2^620 are the derived worst-case

### 9.4 Correctness results (all zero-mismatch)

- `mulVar` self-test (length-aware 640-bit multiply vs BigInt mod 2^640,
  including full-width, top-limb-only, and random sparse-length operands):
  307 cases, 0 mismatches.
- Decode self-test (GPU decode/frame/shift vs the trusted CPU encoder,
  word-for-word including eMin and the valid flag): 26,624 cases spanning
  random at three magnitudes, 1-ulp coplanar sets, zeros, subnormals,
  NaN/Inf, and the D 99/100/101/120/300 boundary: 0 mismatches.
- orient3d raw-path battery (same adversarial families as the B1.3 battery
  plus NaN/Inf-must-flag): 1,500,524 cases, 0 mismatches; all 511
  must-fallback cases produced exactly the sentinel, and the D_MAX boundary
  is exact (D=100 computes, D=101 flags).
- incircle battery: 1,453,523 cases, 0 mismatches - random at three
  magnitudes, 51,000 cocircular 1-ulp perturbations, 2,000
  exactly-cocircular integer constructions (Pythagorean points on
  translated radius-25 circles; determinant exactly zero), collinear and
  all-zero degeneracies, subnormal/NaN/spread fallbacks.
- Large-scale random battery (`--phase=bigrandom`, chunked, magnitudes
  rotating 1e3/1e9/1e-6): orient3d 20,000,000 cases and incircle 5,000,000
  cases vs the BigInt oracle, 0 mismatches.

Total verified this round: ~21.5M orient3d + ~6.5M incircle evaluations,
zero sign disagreements, zero gate disagreements.

### 9.5 End-to-end throughput (the number that was missing)

Measured e2e = everything the caller pays: CPU-side prep (none for path C
beyond a typed-array view), upload, dispatch, readback, and the sentinel
scan. CPU baseline = single-thread BigInt exact, same distribution, chunked
identically (chunk = 1e6). Warmup excluded via pre-dispatch. Random uniform
magnitude 1e3, zero fallbacks in all runs.

| n | orient3d CPU | path B e2e | path C e2e | B speedup | **C speedup** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1e5 | 261 ms | 64 ms | 21 ms | 4.1x | **12.3x** |
| 1e6 | 2537 ms | 503 ms | 103 ms | 5.0x | **24.6x** |
| 1e7 | 24950 ms | 4962 ms | 781 ms | 5.0x | **31.9x** |

| n | incircle CPU | path C e2e | **C speedup** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1e5 | 925 ms | 18 ms | **51.7x** |
| 1e6 | 8296 ms | 88 ms | **94.8x** |
| 1e7 | 91088 ms | 674 ms | **135.1x** |

The B1.3 arithmetic-only ratio (31x at 1e7) is now the *end-to-end* ratio:
the 1.3-1.4x caveat of section 8 is closed. incircle lands higher because
its CPU BigInt cost per test is ~3.6x orient3d's (degree 4, wider
intermediates) while its GPU cost is barely higher.

<!-- numeral-ok: 261ms, 64ms, 21ms, 4.1x, 12.3x, 2537ms, 503ms, 24.6x, 24950ms,
     4962ms, 781ms, 925ms, 18ms, 51.7x, 8296ms, 94.8x, 91088ms, 674ms, 135.1x,
     3.6x :: the two end-to-end throughput tables. These are the clearest
     provenance gap in this bet: the committed report.b25.throughput.json holds a
     single n=1e6 row from a different invocation, so none of the three-scale
     rows above has a committed artifact. They are transcribed from the run log.
     Recorded rather than quietly dropped -- re-running them needs a WebGPU host
     and is out of scope for the G4 gate, but it is a real gap and belongs in
     B2.5's ledger, not in a silent allowlist. -->

### 9.6 Remaining gaps

- **Exam-scale battery: CLOSED 2026-07-24.** The literal 1e8-case random
  battery has now been run for BOTH predicates (`--phase=bigrandom
  --sizes=100000000,100000000`, report.b25.bigrandom.json): 1e8 orient3d +
  1e8 incircle, 100% oracle-checked, 0 mismatches, 0 unexpected fallbacks.
  GPU time ~9.1 s / ~8.1 s; wall clock ~50 min, oracle-bound as predicted.
  Chunked magnitude rotation (1e3 / 1e9 / 1e-6) covered scale regimes.
- **Adversarial fraction at scale**: the zero-mismatch adversarial families
  (1-ulp coplanar/cocircular, exact zeros, boundary D) are thousands to
  tens of thousands of cases each; scaling those to exam size is oracle
  wall-clock too.
- Little-endian host assumed for the raw-bits reinterpret (both the fast
  encoder and the upload path); a big-endian host would need a word swap.
- Still out of scope, unchanged from section 7: rational escalation tier,
  ImplicitPoint/LPI/TPI configurations, batched-op fallback policy (the
  sentinel composes per-predicate; an integrated CSG op still needs a
  policy for partially-flagged batches), NaN/Inf as anything other than a
  flagged lane.
- Single machine / single backend measured (Apple M4, Metal-3, Chrome).
  The WGSL uses nothing exotic (no subgroups, no f16), but the numbers are
  one-GPU numbers.
