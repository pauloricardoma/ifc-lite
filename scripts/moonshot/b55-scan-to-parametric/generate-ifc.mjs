/**
 * B5.5 stage 3 -- rooms.json to a real parametric IFC, through the shipped
 * `@ifc-lite/create` builder. No hand-written STEP: every entity here comes
 * out of the same API a user would call, so the output is a model the rest of
 * the toolchain (kernel, viewer, exporters) reads without special-casing.
 *
 * What is emitted, and what each thing is grounded in:
 *   IfcBuildingStorey  elevation = the fitted floor plane
 *   IfcSpace (n)       profile = the room's simplified ceiling-visibility
 *                      outline; height = that room's ceiling mode minus the
 *                      floor plane. Extruded solid, so its quantities are
 *                      derivable rather than asserted.
 *   IfcSlab            floor slab under the union of the rooms. Thickness is
 *                      NOT measurable from an interior scan (the scanner
 *                      never sees the slab soffit) -- it is emitted at the
 *                      nominal SLAB_THICKNESS and flagged, never scored.
 *   IfcWall (n)        one per room-outline edge at or above WALL_MIN_EDGE,
 *                      axis offset outward by half the thickness so the room
 *                      face lands on the measured outline. Interior partition
 *                      thickness comes from the measured wall channels;
 *                      EXTERIOR thickness is not observable from a
 *                      single-sided interior scan and is emitted at the modal
 *                      interior thickness with `inferred: false` recorded.

 *
 * Every `@ifc-lite/create` element constructor chains its `IfcLocalPlacement`
 * to the storey it is added to, and the storey's own placement is the one
 * carrying `[0, 0, Elevation]`. So the fitted floor elevation is supplied
 * EXACTLY ONCE -- by the storey -- and NEVER in an element coordinate.
 * Repeating it in a coordinate lands that element at 2 x floorZ, which on this
 * scan is 1.369 m below where it belongs.
 *
 * (Before @ifc-lite/create 1.18.0 the parents were not uniform: walls and the
 * slab were storey-relative while spaces were world-relative, so this file had
 * to hand the elevation to spaces and withhold it from walls. That asymmetry
 * was the defect; the builder now places every kind against the storey.)
 *
 * This is invisible to the exam (it scores IfcSpace quantities, every one of
 * which is invariant under a rigid Z shift of the walls), so
 * `assertCoherentStoreyDatum` reads the datum back out of the emitted STEP
 * before the file is written.
