/**
 * B5.1 identifier guard: nothing user-attributable reaches a committed
 * artifact.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS WRITTEN FIRST. B5.1's inputs are collaboration room logs.
 * A room log is not a measurement, it is a recording of what people typed:
 * user ids, element names, GUIDs, wall-clock timestamps, the room id (which
 * in this deployment's own guide is a slash-separated project and model name,
 * i.e. a file path). Measurements over that corpus are publishable; the corpus
 * is not.
 *
 * NOTHING FORBIDDEN IS WRITTEN IN THIS FILE. Not the tokens the proof plants,
 * not an example identifier, not a sample room id. Net 1 accounts a string for
 * by finding it in a declared set of source files and this file is one of
 * them, so a token quoted here would be a token the guard stops rejecting.
 * That is not a stylistic rule: the first revision quoted three plants in
 * these comments and three proof cases silently stopped being caught by net 1.
 * The plants live in guard-plants.mjs, which is deliberately outside the
 * corpus.
 * So the guard exists before the first artifact is written and every artifact
 * this bet emits goes through it.
 *
 * THE LESSON FROM B5.2, STATED SO IT IS NOT REPEATED. B5.2's guard was blind
 * for a whole bet because it scanned STEP strings with a regex that loses
 * quote parity at the first `''` escape: a single doubled quote inside one
 * string desynchronised the scanner and every identifier after it in the file
 * became invisible. The defect was not the regex, it was the SHAPE of the
 * defence -- a denylist that has to recognise the bad thing, running over a
 * format it has to parse correctly to see anything at all. One parse bug and
 * the guard silently passes everything.
 *
 * SO THIS GUARD IS AN ALLOWLIST, AND IT NEVER PARSES THE CORPUS. Two
 * independent nets, in this order:
 *
 *   NET 1 (primary, allowlist). Every STRING LEAF and every OBJECT KEY of the
 *   candidate artifact must match one of a small closed set of safe shapes
 *   (SAFE_SHAPES). A string that is not recognisably safe FAILS -- the guard
 *   does not have to know what an identifier looks like, only what a
 *   measurement looks like. A novel identifier form nobody anticipated fails
 *   by default rather than passing by default. This is the property B5.2's
 *   guard did not have.
 *
 *   NET 2 (independent, denylist). Every string the guard is given as
 *   forbidden material -- extracted from the actual trace corpus by the
 *   caller, never stored here -- is searched for as a raw substring in the
 *   artifact's serialized bytes AND in its unescaped string leaves,
 *   case-insensitively, with no parsing of any kind. Two views because
 *   `JSON.stringify` escapes: a term carrying a quote or a backslash is not a
 *   substring of the serialized form, and that is a term an operator can
 *   plausibly supply. Substring search over either view cannot lose quote
 *   parity because it has no notion of quotes. Net 2 exists to catch the case
 *   where net 1's allowlist is accidentally widened; net 1 exists to catch what
 *   net 2 was never told about. Neither is trusted alone.
 *
 * The guard NEVER writes a forbidden string anywhere -- not into its own
 * findings, not into an error message, not into an artifact. A finding names
 * the JSON path and a SHA-256 prefix of the offending token, which is enough
 * to locate it in a local run and useless to a reader of the committed file.

/**
 * Net 1 has two halves and a string must satisfy one of them.
 *
 * HALF A -- STRUCTURAL SHAPES. Forms that are measurements or self-describing
 * bookkeeping and cannot carry authored content: numbers, day-precision dates,
 * hex digests this bet computed, semver, and strings too short to be a name.
 * Note what is NOT here: there is no general "looks like an identifier"
 * shape and no general prose shape. An earlier revision of this file had both,
 * and the guard's own planted-identifier proof caught it: a demo session's
 * user id passed the identifier shape, a second-precision timestamp passed the
 * prose shape, and an authored element name passed BOTH nets and would have
 * been written to a committed artifact. That is the same defect
 * as B5.2's, arrived at from a different direction: a shape rule cannot tell a
 * measurement from a name, because names are shaped like words.
 *
 * HALF B -- PROVENANCE. Any other string must appear in a COMMITTED SOURCE
 * FILE this guard was told about. The reasoning is that echoing text which is
 * already published in the repository discloses nothing that was not already
 * public, while text from a room log is by construction absent from every
 * source file. So the question the guard asks is not "does this look
 * dangerous" but "can this bet account for where this string came from",
 * which is a question a novel identifier form fails automatically.
 *
 * WHY CONTAINMENT AND NOT PARSING. Half B is a raw substring test over the
 * concatenated source text -- no tokenizer, no string-literal extraction, no
 * quote tracking. B5.2's guard lost quote parity at the first `''` escape and
 * went blind for a whole bet. The failure mode here is the mirror image and is
 * harmless: if the source text is read wrongly, FEWER strings are accounted
 * for and the guard reports MORE findings. It cannot fail open.
 *
 * PROVENANCE MEANS VERBATIM, AND THE THIRD REVISION IS WHY. Half B once had a
 * word-level fallback: a string was accounted for if every one of its words
 * appeared somewhere in the corpus. That is not provenance, it is vocabulary,
 * and it fails to the same blindness as the two revisions before it -- a real
 * authored name assembled out of words the corpus happens to contain passes
 * with nothing verbatim behind it. A two-word model name of exactly that shape
 * cleared it on this bet's own corpus; the phrase is planted in
 * guard-plants.mjs and, per the note at the top of this file, is not written
 * here. So the fallback is gone. A string is accounted for only if the corpus
 * literally contains it.
 *
 * The reason a fallback existed at all is real and is handled without loosening
 * the test: source composes prose across adjacent string literals and line
 * breaks, so a sentence assembled by `'...a ' + 'b...'` is not a byte-for-byte
 * substring of the file that built it. Rather than accept recombination, the
 * corpus is RECONSTRUCTED before the test -- adjacent quote-plus-quote joins
 * are spliced out and runs of whitespace are collapsed, on both sides. That
 * recovers exactly the sentence the source does emit and nothing else. It can
 * only join text that is already adjacent across a `+` in a committed file,
 * which is text the repository already publishes; it can never assemble a
 * phrase the corpus does not contain in order.
 *
 * AND THE FOURTH REVISION, WHICH IS WHY HALF A IS NOW THIS SHORT. Half A still
 * carried two shapes that were about appearance and not about provenance: a
 * `json-path` shape for the dotted field paths this bet emits, and a
 * `repo-path` shape for in-repo file references. Both were holes, and the
 * json-path one was wide: its dotted tail was optional, so a BARE alphanumeric
 * token matched it. A single-token authored name -- an element name, a project
 * codename, a short user handle, a surname in either a value or a KEY position
 * -- was therefore accounted for by shape alone. Net 2 does not cover that
 * form either: it is not a demo user id and not 22 characters, so unless the
 * operator happened to list the exact word, the guard passed it. That is the
 * same blindness a fourth time.
 *
 * The obvious repair -- require at least one separator -- does NOT close it.
 * A two-part authored name with a dot between the parts still matches, and the
 * repo-path shape still admits anything under a repository directory name,
 * which is the exact shape of a room id in this deployment (a slash-separated
 * project and model name). Tightening an appearance rule produces a narrower
 * appearance rule, which is the move that failed the three times above.
 *
 * So both shapes are DELETED, and this cost nothing: every one of the 294
 * distinct strings across the four artifacts this bet commits is accounted for
 * by half B without them, because a field name this bet emits is by
 * construction written literally in this bet's own source, and so is every
 * repository path it names. Half A is now only forms that cannot carry an
 * authored word at all. Four plants cover the deleted shapes, in
 * guard-plants.mjs, outside the corpus: the bare token in a value, the same in
 * a key, the dotted two-part name that survives the narrower rule, and the
 * repository-path-shaped room id.
