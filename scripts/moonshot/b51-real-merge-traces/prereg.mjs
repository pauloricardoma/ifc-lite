/**
 * B5.1 PRE-REGISTRATION. Written and committed BEFORE the measurement.
 *
 * This module holds two things and nothing else: the PREDICTION and the
 * ADMISSIBILITY BAR. It performs no measurement, imports nothing that does,
 * and is the only place either is stated. `run.mjs` imports it and is not
 * permitted to restate a threshold in its own body -- so a result cannot be
 * accompanied by a bar that was quietly adjusted to fit it.
 *
 * The reason for the separation is the failure mode this bet is most exposed
 * to. B5.1 adjudicates B2.1, and both plausible outcomes are publishable: "the
 * spatial rule earns its place on real data" and "it does not". A bet with two
 * publishable outcomes and no pre-registered prediction is a bet that reports
 * whatever came out and calls it the finding. Registering first makes exactly
 * one of the two outcomes a surprise, which is the only condition under which
 * the measurement is worth more than its own arithmetic.
 *
 * PROVENANCE OF THE PREDICTION. It is not a guess made up for this file. It is
 * B4.2's own derived-cut sensitivity grid, extended to the population B5.1 was
 * commissioned to measure. B4.2 found the spatial rule's true catches collapse
 * from nine to zero-or-one once the cut is DERIVED rather than stored, and
 * named the survivor: an opening added into an element another client removes,
 * which is IfcRelVoidsElement referential integrity and needs no geometry to
 * catch. This bet predicts that result holds on the population, and registers
 * the read-set claim as a second, separately falsifiable clause.

 * real traces: three demo rooms replayed by one developer on one afternoon
 * would satisfy the sentence and adjudicate nothing.
 *
 * Every threshold below is a floor for the run to COUNT AS AN ADJUDICATION of
 * B2.1. Failing the bar is not a failed bet -- it is a measurement that is not
 * entitled to the word. The distinction is the whole point of registering it.
