/**
 * What is the scored observable INVARIANT under, and is there a check that is
 * not?
 *
 * THE OBSERVABLE. Ground truth in this battery is `canonicalStateBytes`, and
 * that function serializes exactly: the storey vocabulary, and per entity its
 * node id, key, ifcType, storeyId, hostId, property sets and meshes. The
 * observable is therefore blind to every part of the model that is not one of
 * those, and two orders that differ only outside that list are scored as
 * having commuted.
 *
 * THE FIRST CANDIDATE WAS WRONG, AND THAT IS RECORDED HERE RATHER THAN
 * QUIETLY DROPPED. This audit was written expecting the hosting relation to be
 * in the null space, on the reasoning that footprint.ts excludes
 * relationship-kind ancestors. It is not: B4.2 added `hostId` to the canonical
 * bytes, with a comment saying why. So the hosting hazard IS visible to the
 * oracle and the null space is somewhere else. The rest of this function is
 * what was found after that correction.
 *
 * WHERE IT ACTUALLY IS. `ModelState` carries exactly one relationship, the
 * host-to-opening link. Spatial containment is carried as a STRING on the
 * entity, and the relationship node that aggregates a storey's elements exists
 * only in the DAG, never in the state. Nothing in the op vocabulary writes it.
 * So the observable is invariant under every edit to spatial-structure
 * membership, and the generator cannot produce one -- which means the entire
 * battery, at every schedule count and every seed, contains zero instances of
 * the one op class footprint.ts's own docstring names as out of scope:
 *
 *   "an EditOp whose targetNodeIds names a relationship/layer node DIRECTLY
 *   ... is added to writtenNodes as a target, but a concurrent edit to one of
 *   that storey's elements will NOT see it, because the element-edit's own
 *   ancestor walk excludes the storey node ... if a future op kind targets
 *   containers directly, this rule needs revisiting."
 *
 * That is a soundness caveat the module states about itself, and the
 * exam that is supposed to adjudicate the predicate is invariant under it. It
 * is the same shape as an exam that cannot see a wall placed below its room:
 * not a wrong answer, an unasked question.
 *
 * THE CHECK THAT IS NOT INVARIANT. Below, the op vocabulary is extended by one
 * kind -- setting a storey's membership list, which is an ordinary edit to
 * `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure.RelatedElements` -- and the predicate
 * under test is asked about it, UNMODIFIED, over footprints built its own way.
 * The verdict is asserted positively: the predicate must clear the pair AND the
 * two orders must diverge.
 *
 * WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT ESTABLISH, STATED HERE BECAUSE THE FIRST WRITE-UP
 * OVERCLAIMED IT AND A REVIEWER CAUGHT IT. It establishes a property of this
 * predicate: its soundness argument excludes ops that target a container node
 * directly, and on exactly such a pair it clears a divergence. That is real and
 * is not softened.
 *
 * It does NOT establish a defect in a shipped product path, and the earlier
 * phrasing -- "an unsound auto-merge in shipped code, on an op the product
 * supports" -- was wrong on both halves of the qualifier:
 *
 *   - The predicate is not shipped. It lives in packages/provenance, whose
 *     package manifest is private and self-describes as a prototype, and no
 *     other package in this repository depends on it. Nothing routes a user
 *     edit to it.
 *   - The product does support containment edits, but through a DIFFERENT
 *     merger. They are `set-child` and `remove-child` in packages/merge, and
 *     that package's three-way planner classifies a concurrent divergence on a
 *     child slot as a hierarchy conflict rather than auto-merging it. So on the
 *     path a user can actually reach, this pair is refused, not cleared.
 *
 * The correct claim is therefore about the exam, not about the product: the
 * battery cannot generate the one op class the footprint module names as
 * outside its own soundness argument, so that caveat has never been tested.
 * The reachability facts are recorded as fields on the result so a reader gets
 * them next to the verdict rather than from a report they may not have open.
