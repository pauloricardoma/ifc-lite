/**
 * B4.5 — the M1 midterm run as literally worded, all three clauses in ONE run.
 *
 * The exam (docs/vision/moonshots-finishing-plan.md §4 "M1", §5 "B4.5"):
 *
 *   A wall edit on the 169 MB Holter Tower fixture WITH REAL GEOMETRY-MESH
 *   LEAVES PRESENT, certificate verified in a second process in under 500 ms
 *   while resolving under 5% of DAG nodes, and over 90% cache hits on
 *   single-wall recompute.
 *
 * Why this script exists: the two halves had never been done at once.
 *   - `g0-certificate-demo.mjs` ran the 169 MB fixture but SKIPPED geometry-mesh
 *     leaves entirely (data plane only) and verified IN-PROCESS.
 *   - `g1-memoized-recompute.mjs` ran real mesh leaves but on the small duplex
 *     fixture; its 169 MB run again skipped meshes.
 * So the headline "63 ms, 0.052% of nodes, 169 MB" is a DATA-PLANE-ONLY number.
 * This script is g1's work at g0's scale, with g0's certificate, verified the
 * way b35-demo verifies: in a genuinely separate `node` process.
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *   1. Parse the fixture (packages/cli's loader -> ColumnarParser).
 *   2. Mesh it headlessly (GeometryProcessor, wasm-backed) — the SAME path
 *      `packages/cli`'s clash command and g1's mesh run use. This is the
 *      expensive step and its cost is reported honestly, separately.
 *   3. Build ONE node-hash-v0 DAG containing BOTH planes:
 *        geometry-mesh leaves (one per MeshData)  \
 *        property-set leaves (one per Pset/Qset)  / -> element -> storey
 *        (`relationship`) -> root (`layer`)
 *      Same shape and same node-kind vocabulary as g0/g1.
 *   4. Two single-wall edits, each recomputed through @ifc-lite/provenance's
 *      ProvenanceDag (clause 3, cache hits):
 *        A. property-only wall edit (the shape g1's exam used)
 *        B. property + GEOMETRY wall edit — every mesh leaf of that wall moves
 *           1 mm. This is the honest reading of "a wall edit ... with real
 *           geometry-mesh leaves present": the edit itself touches geometry.
 *      Edit B is the one the certificate is cut from.
 *   5. Certificate for edit B: writes = the wall's mesh leaves + the edited
 *      pset + element + storey + root; reads = the wall's untouched sibling
 *      psets; claim = `subtree-untouched` over every OTHER storey.
 *   6. Verify in a SECOND PROCESS (`verify-worker.mjs`), 1 warmup + 5 timed
 *      spawns, counting every resolver lookup (clauses 1 and 2).
 *   7. Tamper battery in the second process: (a) flip one float in a bundled
 *      mesh payload, (b) flip one child hash under a bundled untouched-storey
 *      subtree, (c) do (b) AND re-derive the claim's own hash so the
 *      certificate agrees with the lie, then stamp an attacker-chosen trust
 *      anchor on it and on the bundle's `expected*` fields. Each must be
 *      rejected, must have altered something, and must be rejected for the
 *      SPECIFIC reason it was written to prove.
 *   8. Correctness cross-check: a from-scratch rebuild over the final payload
 *      state must reproduce the incrementally recomputed DAG exactly. It is
 *      part of the verdict, not a note beside it.
 *
 * Writable domain for this bet is `scripts/moonshot/b45-m1-midterm/**` only;
 * nothing under packages/ or the g0/g1 scripts is touched.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/moonshot/b45-m1-midterm/run.mjs [--probe] [--no-aggregates]
 *        [--write-scorecard | --scorecard-out <path>] [fixture.ifc]
 *
 *   --probe             stop after parse + mesh + structure and print an
 *                       extrapolated cost for the full mesh-leaf hash pass.
 *   --no-aggregates     use g0/g1's narrower DAG shape (storey containment only,
 *                       no IfcRelAggregates expansion) for a like-for-like
 *                       comparison against those runs.
 *   --write-scorecard   re-bless: overwrite the COMMITTED scorecard next to this
 *                       script (`scorecard.json`, or `scorecard-no-aggregates.json`
 *                       under --no-aggregates).
 *   --scorecard-out <p> write the scorecard to an explicit path.
 * Env:
 *   B45_SKIP_CROSSCHECK=1   skip the from-scratch rebuild cross-check
 *   B45_KEEP_BUNDLES=1      keep the working bundles instead of deleting them
 *   B45_OUT=<dir>           where bundles go (default: a fresh per-run mkdtemp
 *                           directory; setting this makes the path shared again,
 *                           so do not point two concurrent runs at one)
 *   B45_HEAP_MB=<n>         old-space limit for the re-exec (default 12288)
 *
 * THE PLAIN RUN DOES NOT TOUCH THE COMMITTED SCORECARD. It writes to a temp
 * path and prints where. An earlier revision always wrote `scorecard.json` next
 * to this script, which meant the documented reproduction command destroyed the
 * source of truth it was supposed to be checked against -- and `--no-aggregates`
 * destroyed it with figures from a DIFFERENT DAG shape. Re-blessing is now an
 * explicit act (`--write-scorecard`), which is what a source of truth deserves.
 *
 * The script re-execs itself once with a raised old-space limit; a mesh-bearing
 * DAG at this scale does not fit in Node's default heap.

// tamper battery on a PASS scorecard, testing nothing. The silent form is
// worse: both runs use the same TRUST_ROOT and KERNEL_VERSION, so one run's
// bundle verifies `ok: true` in the other's worker -- measured, the FZK bundle
// at duplex's shared path returns `ok: true, nodesResolved: 8` where the
// genuine bundle returns 22, so clause 1 and clause 2 would be reported over a
// different model with this run's denominator. `mkdtemp` makes the path

 * Build the node spec factory. Same node-kind vocabulary and same

 *
 *   - meshes are bucketed by expressId ONCE (g1's per-element
 *     `meshes.filter(...)` is O(elements x meshes) — fine on duplex, quadratic
 *     death on the tower);
 *   - mesh typed arrays are referenced, not copied (g1's `Float32Array.from`

 *   - `expandAggregates` (default on) also walks `IfcRelAggregates` from each
 *     storey-contained element, registering decomposed sub-elements as element
 *     nodes under their parent element.
 *
 * That last one is not cosmetic. g0/g1 reach elements ONLY through
 * `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure`, and on this fixture that misses 40,028
 * of 110,632 MeshData entries (36%) — 27,427 IfcMember + 11,469 IfcPlate, i.e.
 * the curtain-wall system, which is aggregated into its host rather than
 * contained by the storey. Leaving them out would understate the geometry
 * plane by a third while claiming "mesh leaves present". Both shapes are run
 * and both are reported, because the wider shape ALSO inflates the clause-2
 * denominator — see REPORT.md, this is called out rather than banked.
