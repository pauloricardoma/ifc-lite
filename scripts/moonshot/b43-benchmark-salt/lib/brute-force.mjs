 * The 32-bit stream-recovery probe, split out of run.mjs (AGENTS.md: no module

 *
 * This measures the design that is NOT shipped: if the salted path had merely
 * concatenated the salt into the existing 32-bit hashed key, an attacker could
 * sweep the whole stream space per seed and confirm candidates against the
 * bytes they were served. The cost of that sweep is what makes the keyed
 * HMAC construction necessary rather than decorative.

/**
 * BRUTE-FORCE PROBE: what a salt bolted onto the EXISTING 32-bit stream would
 * have been worth.
 *
 * The unsalted engine is mulberry32 over an FNV-1a hash: 32 bits of state,
 * whatever you concatenate into the key. A salted-by-concatenation stream is
 * therefore one of 2^32 streams, and the served bytes are a free verification
 * oracle - the parameter draws become dimensions in the file. This measures how
 * fast an attacker can test candidates against that oracle, so the cost of the
 * full sweep is a number rather than an assertion. The shipped salted path is
 * keyed into a 128-bit sfc32 state precisely so this sweep does not exist.
 *
 * Honesty about what is measured: the sweep is not run to completion (that is
 * the point - it is measured, then extrapolated). A window that CONTAINS the
 * true key is swept, so the oracle is shown to actually identify it, and the
 * throughput over that window drives the extrapolation.
