/**
 * B5.5 regression coverage: the scan-to-parametric pipeline on a SYNTHETIC
 * two-room apartment whose every quantity is known in closed form.
 *
 * WHY SYNTHETIC. The bet's committed result comes off a 3.9 GB client scan
 * that cannot be committed, fetched, or run in CI, so a fixture-backed gate on
 * the real input is not available. What IS available is the property that
 * makes the pipeline checkable at all: given a cloud whose rooms are known
 * rectangles, every stage's output is an arithmetic consequence of those
 * rectangles. This file builds such a cloud, runs the REAL stage scripts on
 * it, and asserts the numbers -- not that the scripts exited 0.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, and what each case would catch:
 *
 *  A  extract-rooms.mjs   floor/ceiling plane, room count, per-room area and
 *                         clear height, and the measured wall-channel width.
 *                         Catches: a broken plane fit, a lost or merged
 *                         component, a raster/polygon area drift, a channel
 *                         measurement that stops finding the partition.
 *
 *  B  generate-ifc.mjs    the emitted model's ABSOLUTE placement datum, read
 *                         back out of the STEP. Catches the defect this file
 *                         was written for: `@ifc-lite/create` placed
 *                         `addIfcWall`/`addIfcSlab` relative to the storey
 *                         and `addIfcSpace` relative to the world, so
 *                         handing the same Z to both put the walls at 2x the
 *                         storey elevation. Fixed in 1.18.0 -- every kind is
 *                         storey-relative now -- but the assertion stays,
 *                         because it is what catches the semantics moving
 *                         again in either direction. The exam cannot see this:
 *                         it scores IfcSpace quantities, every one of which is
 *                         invariant under a rigid Z shift of the walls.
 *
 *  B' negative control    the same check must REJECT a model whose elevation
 *                         is applied twice -- once by the storey and again in
 *                         the element coordinates. An assertion that cannot
 *                         fail is not evidence, so that model is rebuilt here
 *                         through the same builder and required to be caught.
 *
 *  C  score.mjs           the scoring arithmetic against a reference model
 *                         with DELIBERATE, known deviations placed either
 *                         side of the 5% bar: the deviation percentages are
 *                         checked against closed-form values and the verdict
 *                         against the construction. Catches a sign error, a
 *                         wrong denominator, a bar comparison that drifted to
 *                         `<`, an unscored row silently counted as a pass, and
 *                         a correspondence that stops resolving.
 *
 * Runtime is a few seconds: the cloud is ~0.4 M points and both scored models
 * are a handful of extruded solids.
 *
