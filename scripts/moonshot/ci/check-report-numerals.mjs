/**
 * Prose-versus-artifact numeral report for the moonshot bets.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The G4 standing adversarial review
 * (docs/vision/reviews/g4-red-team-2026-07-29.md, section 6) found that five
 * of the seven things the orchestrator's verification structurally cannot
 * catch are the same thing: prose that no artifact backs. All three hard
 * catches in that review were of this class -- the code was re-run and
 * reproduced to the digit, but nobody diffed the sentences against the JSON.
 * Its named cheap fix is this script: "make every number quoted in a REPORT
 * or DESIGN emit from the scorecard JSON, and add a check that every numeral
 * in the prose appears in the artifact."
 *
 * IT GATES, AND HERE IS WHAT THAT COST. The first revision of this script was
 * report-only, on the argument that prose legitimately contains numbers no
 * artifact emits -- bars from the plan, figures re-quoted from another bet's
 * run, arithmetic done in the sentence ("43.7% of the DAG"), counts from a
 * variant run whose output was never committed -- so a strict checker would
 * flag a dozen honest lines per document and get `|| true`-d within a week.
 * That argument was right about the noise and wrong about the conclusion: a
 * report nobody is obliged to act on is how the fourth bad figure reached the
 * finishing plan. The fix was to make each of those honest lines say WHY, once,
 * next to itself (see MARKER_RE below), and then gate on the remainder. The
 * whole tree is curated to zero, `--gate` is wired into
 * .github/workflows/moonshot.yml as step E9, and the default run is still a
 * ranked report so a human can look without failing anything.
 *
 * WHAT IT SEES. Two kinds of prose set: every bet directory under
 * scripts/moonshot/ against its own artifacts, and every .md under
 * docs/vision/ -- the plans, the reviews and the spec, i.e. the gate record
 * itself -- against the union of every moonshot artifact in the tree. The
 * second kind exists because the first revision hard-coded its root to
 * scripts/moonshot and therefore structurally could not see the documents where
 * the gate record lives, which is how a wrong B4.5 figure (907 ms against a
 * committed 899) got into amendment 6 of the finishing plan in the very commit
 * that was remediating wrong figures.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS BACKED. For a numeral written as `N` in the prose, the
 * tolerance is the half-ULP of its own last written digit -- 56.5 admits
 * [56.45, 56.55), so the artifact's 56.494 backs it; 2.19e-13 admits
 * +/- 0.5e-15. That is the rule a careful writer already follows, so it
 * neither invents slack nor punishes rounding. On top of that the value is
 * compared under scale factors chosen BY THE UNIT the prose wrote: x100 for a
 * percent against a stored fraction, /1e3 for seconds against milliseconds,
 * and /1e3, /1e6, /1e9 plus the three 1024 powers for byte units. So `0.0239%`
 * matches an artifact `0.023944` and `2.80 s` matches `2796`. Scales are NOT
 * applied blindly across units -- see scalesFor() for what that cost.
 * Thousands separators are stripped before parsing, so `250,582` and `250582`
 * are the same number.
 *
 * WHAT IS IGNORED, AND WHY (the false-positive controls):
 *   - fenced code blocks and inline code spans. Reproduction commands, flags,
 *     file names and type names (`f32`, `--segment 96`) are the single largest
 *     source of noise and none of them are claims.
 *   - link targets, bare URLs, HTML comments.
 *   - ISO dates (2026-07-29) and semver-shaped triples (0.8.5, 22.14.0).
 *   - ordered-list markers and numbered headings at the start of a line.
 *   - any numeral glued to a letter or underscore on either side, unless the
 *     trailing run is a known unit: B4.5, IFC4X3, ISSUE_053, node-hash-v0 and
 *     sha256 are identifiers, while 8.9x and 500ms are quantities.
 *   - a numeral whose immediately preceding word is structural: section, act,
 *     clause, phase, gate, bet, step, line, item, instrument, table, figure,
 *     version, round, tier, note, page, appendix, cycle, chapter, milestone,
 *     entry, footnote, run, commit, see, a month name, or a leading `#` / `§`;
 *     and the far end of such a range (`lines 148-171`, `line 241-243`).
 *   - a numeral hyphen-joined to a preceding word and carrying no unit, the
 *     mirror of the trailing-identifier rule: IEEE-754, mid-2027.
 * Everything else is checked. The suppressions are deliberately about SHAPE
 * (this token is not a measurement) and never about VALUE, so no rule here
 * can hide a wrong number.
 *
 * RANKING. Unbacked numerals are ordered by whether the artifact contains
 * something *close but not equal*. A prose 56.5 sitting 0.9% away from an
 * artifact 55.971 is far more likely to be a stale transcription than a prose
 * 40,028 with nothing within 10% of it anywhere in the JSON -- the latter is
 * usually a real quantity from a run that was never committed, which is worth
 * knowing but is a different problem. Near-misses are printed first, closest
 * first, and are suppressed when the neighbourhood is crowded (see
 * matchDirect) so the report never points at an unrelated field.
 *
 * DIMENSIONLESS numerals that are only explicable as a ratio over two artifact
 * values (a/b, a/b*100, percent change) get their own lower tier. It is always
 * printed, never folded into "backed", and it FAILS --gate: over a scorecard
 * with a hundred numbers those pairings land by coincidence often enough to be
 * worthless as a clearance (B4.5's genuine `8.9x` margin "explains" as the
 * percent change between two unrelated verify medians). Read that tier as "a
 * reader could plausibly have computed this in the sentence, and the checker
 * cannot tell whether they did", which is a reason to mark it, not to clear
 * it.
 *
 * KNOWN LEGITIMATE-BUT-UNBACKED CLASSES, i.e. what a `numeral-ok` marker is
 * for. None can be suppressed by a rule without also suppressing a real catch,
 * which is why each one is annotated by hand instead:
 *   - a number the prose itself is quoting in order to RETRACT it (B4.5's
 *     correction paragraph quotes the removed row's figures verbatim, and if
 *     they ever became backed that paragraph would be wrong);
 *   - prose that truncates rather than rounds a unit conversion (`36 MB` from
 *     36,536,090 B is 36.5, outside the half-ULP of "36") -- prefer fixing the
 *     prose;
 *   - a bar, budget, target or tolerance (`< 500 ms`, `< 5%`, `1e-6`);
 *   - a figure re-quoted from a DIFFERENT bet's run, or from a bet whose branch
 *     is not yet in this tree -- these self-heal, because the marker goes STALE
 *     when the artifact arrives;
 *   - a format constant or a derivation done in the document (`96 B/tuple`, the
 *     512-bit width budget);
 *   - session bookkeeping (model calls, timeouts) that no results file stores.
 * Where a number could instead be EMITTED, emit it: that is strictly better
 * than a marker, and it is what was done for B4.5's g0/g1 DAG shape rather than
 * leaving three figures excused.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A TRUTH GATE, AND THE SCRIPT SAYS SO IN ITS OWN OUTPUT. The
 * decoy calibration below measures the only thing that matters about a green
 * run: how often a deliberately-wrong number is cleared as "backed" by
 * coincidence. Against a single curated scorecard that rate is near zero.
 * Against `docs/vision`, whose haystack is the UNION of every moonshot
 * artifact in the tree (~8,900 numbers), it is high: tens of percent, and over
 * 90% on one document. No figure is transcribed here on purpose -- the run
 * epilogue COMPUTES the docs/vision span from the run it just did, because a
 * checker that hunts stale numerals must not carry one in its own header. (The
 * 57.5%-to-91.7% figures quoted here before 2026-08-01 were measured with a
 * decoy generator that rendered every exponent-form numeral through toFixed()
 * and so tested a decoy of 0.000000.) A "backed"
 * verdict there means "some field somewhere in the program holds this value",
 * which is close to no information at all. The gate catches a figure that
 * contradicts a named artifact; it does not certify one that agrees with the
 * pile.
 *
 * THE FIX FOR THAT IS POSITIVE BINDING, NOT A BIGGER HAYSTACK. A second marker
 * form names the artifact and the JSON path a figure comes from:
 *
 *   <!-- numeral-src: 899 :: b45-m1-midterm/scorecard.json#sensitivityElementGranularityClaim.verifyMs -->
 *
 * A bound numeral is checked against that ONE value, so its haystack is 1 and
 * its decoy pass rate is ~0 (a 3-30% perturbation cannot land inside the
 * half-ULP of a single named field). A binding that resolves and disagrees is a
 * hard finding -- the strongest check in this script, because it is the only
 * one that can say "this sentence contradicts the field it claims to quote".
 * A binding into a bet directory that is not in this tree yet is PENDING: it is
 * not counted as backed, its decoys are never cleared, and it becomes a real
 * check the moment the branch lands. A binding into a directory that DOES exist
 * but whose file or path does not is a broken binding and fails the gate.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/moonshot/ci/check-report-numerals.mjs
 *   node scripts/moonshot/ci/check-report-numerals.mjs <dir-or-repo-root> ...
 *   node scripts/moonshot/ci/check-report-numerals.mjs --gate      # exit 1 on findings

 * The token list is written exactly as this report prints a finding
 * (`raw + unit`, thousands separators included: `1,376`, `24.27%`, `2.19e-13`,
 * `907ms`). A marker is FILE-SCOPED: it clears those tokens anywhere in the

 * numerals are grouped by (raw, unit) across the file, not by line.
 *
 * WHY IN THE FILE AND NOT IN AN ALLOWLIST FILE. The defect this whole script
 * exists to catch is prose drifting away from the thing that justifies it. An
 * allowlist in a sibling directory is that defect wearing a different hat: it
 * is edited in a different commit from the sentence it excuses, it is keyed on
 * something (a line, a path) that moves, and nobody reading the claim ever sees
 * it. A marker three lines from the number appears in the same diff hunk as the
 * number, so a reviewer changing the sentence is shown the reason it was
 * excused. Markers live inside HTML comments, which maskProse() already blanks,
 * so they cannot themselves smuggle a numeral into the document.
 *
 * ANTI-ROT. An excuse must not outlive its reason, so markers are checked in
 * both directions. A marker naming a token that is now BACKED, or that no
 * longer appears in the document at all, is reported as STALE and fails
 * --gate. That is deliberate friction: when another bet's artifact lands in the
 * tree and its figures become checkable, the gate says so instead of leaving a
