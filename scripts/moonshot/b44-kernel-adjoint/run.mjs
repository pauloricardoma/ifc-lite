 * Strip cargo's build chatter and any workstation identity from captured output

 * progress lines carry absolute paths into the toolchain, the registry and the
 * user's home directory - i.e. a local account name, in a public repo, in a file
 * whose whole purpose is to be read by strangers. None of that is evidence: the
 * evidence is the harness's own report between the marker lines. So the progress
 * lines go, and whatever absolute paths survive in a compiler diagnostic or a
 * panic message are redacted rather than trusted to be harmless.
 *
 * `Finished ... in 8.41s` and `Running unittests ... (target/debug/deps/x-<hash>)`
 * go for a second reason: a build time and a binary hash change on every run, so
 * keeping them means the committed artifact diffs when nothing measured moved.
