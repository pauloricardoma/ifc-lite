/**
 * GATE for issue #2944: nothing prevented a sixth unguarded entity-reference
 * walk.
 *
 * #2866 was one self-referential `IfcBooleanResult.FirstOperand` in an
 * uploaded file, and the failure mode is not a bad render -- a Rust stack
 * overflow is `SIGABRT`, not a catchable panic, so nothing upstream can turn
 * it into a load error, and in the wasm geometry worker it takes down the
 * instance. Six sites were fixed one at a time (#2868, #2869, #2870, #2871,
 * #2872, #2874) and #2873 gave the guard-CHOICE rule (AGENTS.md, "Bounding walks
 * over file-supplied references") plus the shared `MAX_MAPPED_ITEM_DEPTH` constant.
 * What neither produced is something that FAILS when a seventh walk lands
 * unguarded. That is this file.
 *
 * Run: `node scripts/check-refwalk-guards.mjs` (also `pnpm check:refwalk-guards`).
 *
 * ## What it flags
 *
 * A function is a CANDIDATE reference-following walk when either signal fires:
 *
 *   recursion -- it sits on a self- or mutual-recursion cycle in its file's
 *     local call graph, and that cycle reaches `decode_by_id` / `resolve_ref` /
 *     `resolve_ref_list`.
 *   chase     -- it contains a loop that reassigns an EXISTING (non-`let`)
 *     cursor variable from a decode/resolve call, where that same variable is
 *     also the receiver of a `.get(`/`.get_ref(` attribute read in the loop.
 *     This is the walk-expressed-as-a-loop shape, e.g. probe.rs's
 *     `extract_extrusion_direction_recursive`, which despite its name is a loop.
 *
 * A candidate FAILS the gate when no guard is in scope for it -- no
 * `visited`/`seen` set insert, no depth comparison, no bounded `0..MAX_*`
 * range. Guarded candidates pass silently and need no allowlist row, which is
 * why the allowlist is empty rather than the ~50 entries issue #2944's own
 * discussion feared: the gate keys on the GUARD, not on the site.
 *
 * ## Why cycle membership rather than "a loop around a decode call"
 *
 * The issue's literal Option 1 wording -- "a loop or self-recursion reaching
 * decode_by_id/resolve_ref without a visited or depth binding in scope" --
 * over-flags: `processors/advanced_face/edge_loop.rs` calls those functions
 * inside `for` loops at 241, 284 and 339 over a fixed list of edge ids, with
 * no guard because none is needed, and so do most of the ~55 files that call
 * them. Requiring cycle membership (or the chase-loop cursor shape) separates
 * "iterates a fixed-length list" from "follows an attribute reference that may
 * point back into an already-visited entity". Measured over all three scan
 * roots, `edge_loop.rs` is not flagged by either signal.
 *
 * ## Vacuity
 *
 * Three checks in this repo have shipped exiting 0 having examined nothing
 * (`verify-esm-entrypoints.mjs` on an unbuilt tree, `check-tla-chunk-await.mjs`
 * on an empty dist, `vitest-timeout-audit.mjs` with no arguments). This one
 * fails loudly instead: a missing scan root, a root with no `.rs` files, a
 * total candidate count below CANDIDATE_FLOOR, or a file that parses to zero
 * functions while containing an `fn` are each a hard failure. CANDIDATE_FLOOR
 * is the anti-vacuity assertion that matters -- a detector that silently stops
 * matching (a regex edited, a helper renamed) drops to zero candidates and
 * would otherwise report a clean tree.
 *
 * ## Verified against the history it exists to prevent a repeat of
 *
 * Run at each of the six #2866 fixes and at each fix's PARENT commit, over the
 * three scan roots. Five of six: the parent is reported unguarded at the exact
 * function the fix guards, and the fix commit clears it.
 *
 *   #2868 5d54de032 -> f297186c9  wasm-bindings/.../color.rs find_color_for_geometry  DETECTED
 *   #2869 27c6d9962 -> de35ee126  processing/.../symbolic/items.rs extract_symbolic_item  DETECTED
 *   #2870 64bf7d4be -> 8c2a484ba  geometry/.../boolean/mod.rs <-> csg_primitive.rs        MISSED
 *   #2871 f297186c9 -> e543131ff  geometry/.../advanced_face/polyline.rs sample_curve_polyline  DETECTED
 *   #2872 de35ee126 -> 159c93b0a  geometry/.../router/layers.rs item_has_identity_position  DETECTED
 *   #2874 066ca8df9 -> 94a2812a9  geometry/.../processors/surface.rs (2-fn cycle)          DETECTED
 *
 * The fixes landed interleaved, so a commit still reporting OTHER sites
 * unguarded is expected -- those were fixed by a later commit in the list.
 *
 * #2870 is the honest miss and it is the blind spot below, not bad luck:
 * `BooleanClippingProcessor` (boolean/mod.rs) routes its `IfcCsgSolid` operand
 * through `CsgSolidProcessor` (csg_primitive.rs), which constructs a fresh
 * `BooleanClippingProcessor`. The cycle spans two files, and the call graph
 * here is per-file.
 *
 * ## LIMITATIONS -- read before assuming coverage
 *
 * Both signals are lexical and single-file. Specifically:
 *
 *  - CAUGHT: direct self-recursion; mutual recursion between functions in the
 *    SAME file (via an `_inner`/`_guarded` helper, the shape five of the six
 *    #2866 fixes use); a walk expressed as a cursor-reassigning loop.
 *  - NOT CAUGHT: mutual recursion ACROSS files or crates. Measured, not
 *    hypothetical -- it is why #2870 is missed above. Keying the call graph on
 *    bare function names repo-wide was rejected rather than untried: every
 *    processor in `rust/geometry/src/processors` defines `fn process`, so a
 *    global name-keyed graph makes one giant spurious cycle out of them. A
 *    real fix needs type resolution (`syn`), which is a different tool than
 *    this.
 *  - NOT CAUGHT: a walk that reaches the decode through a trait object, a
 *    closure stored in a struct, or any dynamic dispatch -- callee names are
 *    matched textually.
 *  - NOT CAUGHT: an ITERATIVE worklist walk -- `let mut queue = vec![root];
 *    while let Some(id) = queue.pop() { ...decode_by_id(id)...; queue.push(child) }`
 *    with no visited set. Verified by running: neither signal fires, because
 *    there is no recursion cycle and nothing REASSIGNS a cursor, which is what
 *    the chase signal keys on. "Walk-as-a-loop" above means the cursor-chase
 *    loop specifically, not every loop. A self-referential reference makes this
 *    shape spin forever rather than blow the stack, so the symptom differs from
 *    #2866's SIGABRT -- but the missing guard is the same missing guard. The
 *    one worklist BFS in the scan roots today,
 *    `rust/geometry/src/void_index.rs`'s `propagate_voids_via_aggregates`, does
 *    hold a `seen` set -- but by review, not because this gate saw it: it is in
 *    neither the candidate list nor the unguarded list. This is a hole a new
 *    walk can be written into.
 *  - NOT CAUGHT: a walk that reads raw bytes instead of calling
 *    `decode_by_id`/`resolve_ref`. `rust/geometry/src/router/content_hash.rs`'s
 *    `sig_entity` is exactly that, deliberately, for cost reasons. Verified by
 *    running: this gate produces zero candidates for that file, so its
 *    `depth > MAX_DEPTH` cap and memo are held in place by nothing here.
 *  - WEAK: guard DETECTION is presence-of-shape, not correctness. A `visited`
 *    set that is inserted into but never consulted, a depth counter never
 *    incremented, or the WRONG guard for the site (#2872's first attempt used
 *    a depth cap on an eligibility probe and silently dropped layer slicing on
 *    files that render today, because #960 records Revit chains 42 nodes deep)
 *    all read as guarded here. Choosing between a global visited set, a
 *    path-scoped one and a depth cap stays a review question -- AGENTS.md has
 *    the decision procedure. This gate only asserts that SOMETHING is there.
 *    The false-GUARD direction is the one that has actually bitten: an
 *    unrelated `for i in 0..=SEGMENTS` tessellation loop read as a depth cap
 *    and hid #2869's walk until the constant was required to name a bound.
 *  - WEAK: the chase signal is co-occurrence. A loop that reassigns a cursor
 *    from a decode call for one reason while separately reading `.get(...)`
 *    off the same variable name for an unrelated reason would false-positive.
 *    Not observed in the scanned tree.
 *  - NOT CAUGHT: a function named the same as a local one but belonging to an
 *    unrelated impl block, reached via `self.field.name(...)`, is deliberately
 *    NOT read as self-recursion (that fix removed five false positives on
 *    `process` methods). The converse residual stands: `self.name(...)` where
 *    `name` is a trait method that merely shares a name with a local function
 *    would be misread as recursion.

Each of these follows an entity reference supplied by the uploaded file, in a

geometry worker it takes down the whole instance (#2866).

Add a guard. Which one is NOT interchangeable: see AGENTS.md, "Bounding walks over
file-supplied references". Briefly — a GLOBAL visited set where the recursion is
a pure lookup (the answer is a function of the id alone), a PATH-scoped set
where the recursion accumulates (the same node down two branches is two real
pieces of geometry, and a global set silently drops the second), and a depth cap
IN ADDITION where a long acyclic chain can still blow the stack. Do not put a
depth cap on an eligibility probe: #960 records Revit chains 42 DIFFERENCE nodes
deep, and capping one silently drops geometry that renders today.

Use ifc_lite_core::limits::MAX_MAPPED_ITEM_DEPTH rather than a fresh \`= 32\`.
