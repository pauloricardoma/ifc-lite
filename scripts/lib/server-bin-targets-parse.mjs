/**
 * Text-extraction layer for scripts/check-server-bin-targets.mjs.
 *
 * Everything here is COMMENT-AWARE, and that is the point of the module: an
 * adversarial review of PR #2642 showed that regex-anywhere matching gave the
 * parity gate four false greens (a commented-out matrix entry still counted
 * as a target; a commented-out entry in SUPPORTED_TARGETS still parsed; a
 * stale literal in a comment satisfied the upload-name check) and three false
 * reds (a TODO comment inside the Set demanded a matrix change; an entry
 * whose target: was not the first key vanished; a quoted scalar leaked its
 * quotes). So comments are stripped BEFORE any matching, matrix entries are
 * parsed as key/value blocks whose key order is irrelevant, and quoted
 * scalars are unquoted.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a YAML or TypeScript parser - the repo root has no
 * YAML dependency, and two known files are the whole input domain. Where the
 * simplification could misread an exotic construct (a regex literal
 * containing `//`, flow-style YAML), the damage is over-stripping or a
 * skipped entry, and every consumer treats a missing value as a hard error:
 * a misparse fails closed, never green. The executable proof lives in
 * scripts/check-server-bin-targets.test.mjs.

/**
 * Strip YAML comments: a `#` at line start or preceded by whitespace opens a
 * comment unless it sits inside a quoted scalar. Shell embedded in `run: |`
 * blocks uses the same `#`-to-end-of-line form, so one strip is correct for
 * both. Quote state is per-line on purpose - a stray quote in one line must
 * not hide a comment marker in the next.
 *
 * A quote only OPENS a scalar when its closing quote exists later on the same
 * line. A lone apostrophe in unquoted prose ("it's a tag # note") is literal
 * text; treating it as an opener left the line stuck in quote state with
 * every later `#` invisible, so comment text leaked into parsed values - the
 * same silent live-vs-commented confusion this module exists to prevent, one
 * level down. The lookahead makes that stuck state unreachable: quote state
 * always closes before the line ends. The residual misread is a matched
 * FALSE pair straddling a `#` (it's a # x's), which UNDER-strips - the
 * leaked text corrupts a value every consumer compares exactly, so that
 * direction fails red, never green.
