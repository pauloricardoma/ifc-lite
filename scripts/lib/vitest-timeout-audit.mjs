/**
 * #2948: a reliable answer to "does this vitest `it`/`test` call carry an
 * explicit timeout" — reliable meaning it does not fall for either mistake
 * that was actually made while fixing #2947:
 *
 *   - a grep for `}, 60_000);` (the TRAILING form) scores a test written as
 *     `it(name, { timeout: 60_000 }, fn)` (the OPTIONS-OBJECT form) as
 *     unprotected;
 *   - a grep for the options-object form, or for a single-line trailing
 *     number, scores a test whose trailing number is split across lines
 *     (the MULTI-LINE form — same idiom as trailing, just wrapped) as
 *     unprotected.
 *
 * All three are really only TWO shapes once whitespace stops mattering:
 * "3rd top-level argument is a numeric literal" (trailing / multi-line — the
 * two differ only in whether a newline sits before the number) and "2nd
 * top-level argument is an object literal with a `timeout` key". Grep sees
 * whitespace and string content; it cannot tell "argument boundary" from
 * "comma inside a string" or "number inside a comment". This module does,
 * via a small brace/paren-depth scan instead of a regex over raw text.
 *
 * IT ALSO RESOLVES ONE MORE CASE THAT GREP-BASED AUDITS (INCLUDING THE ONE
 * THAT PRODUCED #2948'S OWN AT-RISK TABLE) MISS: a `describe(name, {
 * timeout }, fn)` timeout is inherited by every `it`/`test` nested inside
 * it that does not set its own. Confirmed behaviourally (not asserted from
 * vitest's docs) in this fix's own verification: a child `it` with no
 * timeout of its own, nested under a `describe` carrying `{ timeout: 7000
 * }`, passed a 6000ms sleep under vitest's 5000ms default, and the SAME
 * shape with `{ timeout: 2000 }` failed the 6000ms sleep with "Test timed
 * out in 2000ms" — so the inheritance is real enforcement, not a decorative
 * option only the describe block itself observes. `auditSource` walks
 * enclosing `describe` calls for exactly this reason: a test can be fully
 * protected while its own `it(...)` call carries no timeout argument at
 * all, and a checker that only looks at the `it` call, brace-matched or
 * not, still reports a false positive there.
 *
 * NOT covered, and deliberately out of scope: `beforeEach`/`afterEach`/
 * `beforeAll`/`afterAll` hook timeouts. A hook's own timeout argument is a
 * different budget (`hookTimeout`, 10_000ms default, vs. `testTimeout`'s
 * 5000ms) governing a different span of the test's wall clock — vitest
 * starts a test's own timeout clock only once its hooks have resolved
 * (confirmed the same way: a `beforeEach` that alone takes 5.8s passed
 * under the default 5000ms `testTimeout`). Slow work sitting in a hook is a
 * real thing to check for, but it is not an instance of the three-spellings
 * problem this module solves and folding it in would silently misattribute
 * hook budget to test budget. `parser-worker-panic-forward.test.ts` is a
 * real example of exactly this trap (#2948's own fix).
 *
 * LIMITATIONS, honestly listed rather than silently wrong:
 *   - detection of `it`/`test`/`describe` call sites is lexical (a global
 *     scan for the bare word, not preceded by `.`), so a local variable or
 *     object property literally named `it`/`test`/`describe` used as a
 *     function call is misread as a vitest call. `auditSource` reports an
 *     entry for it rather than crashing, and that entry is wrong. This DOES
 *     happen here: `tests/integration.test.ts` declares its own
 *     `function test(name, fn)` helper, and this module counts that
 *     declaration's parameter list plus nine calls to the helper as ten
 *     unprotected entries — one more site than a TypeScript AST finds in
 *     the whole repo (14310 vs 14309, all of the difference here). It
 *     mirrors the honesty requirement `scripts/check-source-text-assertions.mjs`
 *     documents for its own lexical (not data-flow) detection.
 *   - template-literal interpolations (`` `${…}` ``) are treated as opaque
 *     text, not parsed — a call inside `${…}` would not be found. Not used
 *     anywhere in this repo's `it`/`test`/`describe` argument lists.
 *   - `/regex/` literals are recognised by the standard prev-token
 *     heuristic: a `/` starts a regex when the last significant token
 *     before it is an operator, punctuator, or one of the keywords in
 *     `REGEX_PRECEDING_RE` (`(`, `,`, `=`, `:`, `[`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `?`,
 *     `{`, `;`, `return`, `typeof`, … or start-of-file), and is division
 *     otherwise — including right after a string or template literal,
 *     which `stripNoise` tracks separately because a blanked literal is
 *     indistinguishable from whitespace. This covers every shape actually
 *     seen in this codebase. NOT handled, and each of these is a REAL
 *     defect verified by running this module, not a theoretical one:
 *       * a regex after an operator absent from that list;
 *       * a regex spanning a line break (bailed on, and the `/` is then read
 *         as ordinary);
 *       * a regex immediately after `}` (a block close) or after `)` — both
 *         characters are absent from `REGEX_PRECEDING_RE`, so the `/` is
 *         read as division, and an apostrophe inside the pattern then opens
 *         a phantom string that swallows the REST of the file. The erasure
 *         is POSITIONAL: sites written before the bad token still report,
 *         sites after it disappear. Verified by running this module on a
 *         file with one `it()` either side of the token -- it reports 1 of
 *         2 and exits 0.
 *         So the vacuous-pass guard below does NOT catch this, in a
 *         single-file run either: that guard fires on `testFiles === 0`,
 *         which only total erasure produces. A partial under-count is
 *         indistinguishable from an accurate one, in a tool whose whole
 *         purpose is an accurate count. Fencing it properly means flagging
 *         any `isVitestTestFile` whose site count is 0 -- the four
 *         describe-runner exceptions are already enumerated, so the
 *         allowlist for that check exists.
 *       * the same erasure through a different door: a template literal
 *         nested inside another template literal's `${…}`, whose inner text
 *         holds an apostrophe. `stripNoise` closes the outer template at the
 *         inner backtick and the apostrophe then opens a phantom string.
 *     `stripNoise` MUST step over regex literals — before it did, a regex
 *     containing an apostrophe (`toMatch(/^'/)`) hit the same failure for
 *     the much more common `toMatch(/…/)` shape. Pinned by
 *     `vitest-timeout-audit.test.mjs`.
 *   - a `describe`/`it`/`test` reached through a value rather than named
 *     directly — `const t = it; t('name', fn)`, or a `.each` table built by
 *     a helper — is not found. The one indirection that IS handled is the
 *     immediately-invoked parenthesized form `(cond ? it : it.skip)('name',
 *     fn)`, which this repo uses.
 *   - the tagged-template `.each` spelling, `` it.each`table`(…) ``, is not
 *     recognised at all and contributes zero call sites, silently. No file
 *     in this repo uses it today (verified); a file that started to would
 *     under-report without saying so.
 *   - TypeScript type-argument lists on the call or its modifier
 *     (`it.each<[Role, boolean]>([...])`) are stepped over, but ONLY when
 *     the `<` is adjacent to the callee with no whitespace, which is how
 *     TypeScript type arguments are written and how both occurrences in
 *     this repo are written. The adjacency requirement is what stops JSX
 *     prose in a `.test.tsx` — `test <b>(optional)</b>` — from having its
 *     balanced `<b>` stepped over and the `(optional)` after it read as an
 *     argument list, which invented a call site that does not exist. Prose
 *     written WITHOUT the space (`test<b>(optional)</b>`) would still be
 *     misread. See `skipTypeArguments` for the rest of that scan's limits.
 *
 * Run standalone: `node scripts/lib/vitest-timeout-audit.mjs <file...>`
 * prints one line per `it`/`test` call (`--summary-only` drops that listing
 * and keeps just the counts and the error paths, which is how CI runs it) — deliberately a reporting tool a
 * human reads, not a CI gate: the issue this answers (#2948) is explicit
 * that the RIGHT timeout for a slow test requires understanding what the
 * test does, which this module cannot judge — it only answers "does this
 * call already carry an explicit one, and if so which spelling and value".
 * Unit-tested against synthetic source snippets (never against this repo's
 * real test files — that would be exactly the source-text-as-behaviour
 * substitution `check-source-text-assertions.mjs` exists to block) in
 * `vitest-timeout-audit.test.mjs`.
 *
 * Standalone exit codes: 0 once every file it was given is a vitest test
 * file whose call sites it could parse — INCLUDING a `describe`-wrapped
 * shared-suite runner with zero literal `it`/`test` call sites of its own.
 * 1 if it was given no file arguments, if none of the named files is a
 * vitest test file by {@link isVitestTestFile}'s two-arm test (wrong
 * paths), or if a call site was found but could not be parsed (a parser
 * blind spot, reported as such). An audit of nothing prints a summary of
 * all zeros, which reads like a clean report — see the guard at the bottom
 * of this file.
 *
 * CONFIG-LEVEL PROTECTION (the blind spot fixed after #2948 shipped): a
 * package's `vitest.config.ts` can set `test.testTimeout`, which is vitest's
 * DEFAULT for every `it`/`test` in that package that does not carry its own
 * (call-level or `describe`-level) timeout. Two packages in this repo do
 * this deliberately — `packages/data` and `packages/create-ifc-lite`, both
 * `testTimeout: 30_000` — and everything that scans only `it`/`describe`
 * call sites, this module included before this fix, reported every one of
 * those tests as unprotected (193 calls, confirmed against this repo). This
 * module now also resolves that config value, per test file, by walking
 * from the test file's directory up to its nearest package root (the first
 * ancestor directory containing a `package.json`) and reading the first
 * matching config filename there. Supported filenames, in vitest's own
 * resolution order: `vitest.config.{ts,mts,cts,js,mjs,cjs}`, then
 * `vite.config.{ts,mts,cts,js,mjs,cjs}` (a `vitest.config.*` always wins
 * over `vite.config.*` when both exist — matches vitest's own precedence).
 * Every `vitest.config.*` in this repo today is a `.ts` file with no
 * matching `vite.config.*` alongside it, and no workspace-level config
 * exists at the repo root; the other filenames are supported because
 * vitest itself accepts them, not because anything here uses them yet.
 *
 * The config file is READ AS TEXT, never imported/executed — same
 * `stripNoise` + depth-aware scan the call-site parser uses, not `eval` or
 * a dynamic `import()`, because a config module can have arbitrary side
 * effects and top-level imports that may not resolve outside a real vitest
 * run. `resolveConfigTimeout` looks for a top-level `testTimeout:` key and
 * classifies its value the same way `classifyExplicitTimeout` classifies a
 * call-level timeout: a bare numeric literal (with underscores) resolves to
 * a number. ANYTHING ELSE — a named identifier (`testTimeout: DEFAULT_MS`,
 * which could be a local const or an import), a ternary, a function call —
 * is reported as `determined: false` rather than guessed either way. This
 * is stricter than the call-site scanner's treatment of a bare identifier
 * (which it still counts as "explicit, value unresolved"): at the config
 * level a wrong "protected" verdict is exactly the failure this fix exists
 * to correct, so an undetermined config value gets its own third status,
 * `config-unknown`, distinct from both `protected` and `unprotected` — see
 * `auditFile`.

 *     or no package config (or no `testTimeout` key in it) applies — the
 *     `protectedBy`/`unprotected` verdict from `auditSource` stands as-is;
 *   - `'determined'`: no config governs, sets `protectedBy: 'config'` and
 *     `value` to the resolved number — genuinely protected, just by a
 *     package default rather than this call's own argument list;
 *   - `'unknown'`: a `testTimeout:` key exists in the governing config but
 *     its value could not be statically resolved (see
 *     `resolveConfigTimeout`). `protectedBy` is left `null` (NOT flipped to
 *     `'config'`) because we have no evidence the value is anything other
 *     than vitest's 5000ms default made explicit — but this is also not
 *     the plain "no timeout anywhere" case `auditSource` alone would
 *     report, so callers must not silently fold it into "unprotected"
 *     either. Report it as its own bucket.

/**
 * Refuse a vacuous run: a summary of all zeros reads exactly like a clean
 * pass, so an invocation that audited nothing must exit non-zero and say
 * what it expected instead. Three ways to audit nothing, each with its own
 * message because the remedy differs:
 *   - no file arguments at all (e.g. a caller whose target list expanded to
 *     nothing, or a future CI wiring with no default targets);
 *   - files were named, but not one of them is a vitest test file by
 *     {@link isVitestTestFile} — they classify nothing, so the paths are
 *     wrong;
 *   - a file DOES hold call sites, but this module could not parse them.
 *     That is a bug in this parser, not in the caller's paths, and saying
 *     "check your paths" there would send the reader hunting the wrong
 *     thing. Zero such files exist in this repo today (verified by running
 *     `findUnparsedCallSites` over all 1288 `.test.ts`/`.test.tsx` files);
 *     the check exists so a future parser blind spot surfaces as a loud
 *     failure instead of a silently lower count.
 * ZERO `it`/`test` call sites is NOT by itself an error, and must not be:
 * a `describe`-wrapped shared-suite runner
 * (`describe('X conformance', () => runConformanceSuite(fixtures))`) is a
 * legitimate test file with no literal call site of its own, and this repo
 * has four of them. An earlier version of this guard failed exactly those
 * files; the version after it swung the other way and accepted any file
 * containing the WORD, which let fifteen of this repo's 993 non-test
 * `packages/*​/src/**.ts` modules exit 0 with an all-zero summary. The
 * two-arm rule in `isVitestTestFile` accepts all four runners, all 1288
 * test files, and seven of the 993 — measured, not assumed. This is the
 * same shape as `check-tla-chunk-await.mjs` refusing to run against a
 * missing dist and `scripts/lib/server-bin-targets-parse.mjs`'s
 * `refusing a vacuous pass`.
 *
 * The guard is per-RUN, not per-file: one healthy file satisfies it. A
 * single corrupted file inside a large run therefore still contributes
 * silently zero — see the regex/template erasure notes in LIMITATIONS.
