/**
 * Git plumbing for the TypeScript module-size ratchet
 * (`scripts/check-module-size.mjs`): the merge base with main, the paths a
 * change touched, and a blob at a commit. Split out of the CLI when #4388
 * gave check mode its own use for the merge base — the CLI is allowlisted
 * and may not grow. `check-source-text-assertions.mjs` carried its own copy
 * of `resolveBase`/`readBlobAt` until #4536 and imports these now, so this
 * is the one derivation, and the copy the next gate should import rather
 * than write again.
 *
 * Every function here FAILS CLOSED: an unreadable path, a root that is not
 * the top of its worktree, or no merge base at all is an `{ error }`, never a
 * silent repo-wide fallback. A fallback is the annexation #3398 was about, in
 * the one context — a shallow clone, a detached checkout, a script — where
 * nobody is reading the output.

 * may arrive through a symlink (macOS /var -> /private/var). Requiring the
 * top to BE the scanned root stops a synthetic tree nested inside some other
 * repository from silently inheriting that repository's diff. Either side
 * unresolvable is a REFUSAL, not a pass: `safeRealpath` answers null on
 * failure, so a bare `!==` would compare null to null and let the guard
 * through in exactly the case where it knows least about the two paths.
