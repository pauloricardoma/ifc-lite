/**
 * Final-kind classification for a parsed runner result, and the ALL_SKIPPED
 * kind itself. Split out of `revert-oracle.mjs` to keep that file at its
 * recorded module-size budget (the same reason `revert-oracle-python.mjs`,
 * `revert-oracle-rust-features.mjs` and `revert-oracle-plan-runs.mjs` exist) —
 * `parseRunnerOutput`'s merge point already decided NO_TESTS/UNPARSEABLE/
 * ASSERTION_FAILURE/PASS from `{ passed, failed, total }`; this is that same
 * decision with one more branch (#4108).
 *
 * WHY ALL_SKIPPED IS ITS OWN KIND, NOT FOLDED INTO PASS. vitest's and node
 * --test's summary lines count a skipped test into the same `total` as a
 * passed one: vitest's `Tests  2 skipped (2)` parses to
 * `{ passed: 0, failed: 0, total: 2 }` — exactly the shape a
 * `describe.skipIf` guard produces when its fixture is absent (AGENTS.md
 * requires skipping, not throwing, in that case). Nothing ever executed, so
 * scoring that PASS lets the oracle treat a baseline that measured nothing as
 * a clean baseline, and then score an identically-skipped reverted run as an
 * UNOBSERVED "finding about the author's tests" when the truth is nothing
 * was ever measured (#4108).
 *
 * pytest and cargo do not have this gap: `parsePython` already collapses an
 * all-skipped run to `total: 0`, which routes through the existing NO_TESTS
 * path, and cargo's summary line does not fold `ignored` into its `passed +
 * failed` total at all. Only vitest and node --test count skipped tests into
 * `total`, so only their output can reach this branch with `total > 0`.
 *
 * PARTIAL SKIPS ARE NOT FLAGGED. A file where some tests ran and some were
 * skipped still has at least one executed assertion that could have gone red
 * on the revert — real evidentiary value, not a capability gap. Only a
 * WHOLLY skipped file (`passed === 0 && failed === 0`) is vacuous. Do not
 * broaden this to "any skip" — AGENTS.md's own skip-not-throw convention for
 * missing fixtures depends on partial skips being unremarkable.

/**
 * `aggregate()`'s severity walk (`revert-oracle.mjs`) ranks ALL_SKIPPED above
 * PASS, which is right when a run's ONLY signal is an all-skipped package —
 * #4108's own case: the baseline measured nothing, so nothing can be
 * concluded — but wrong when ANOTHER package in the same run produced real
 * evidence (a PASS or ASSERTION_FAILURE). An env-gated all-skip file (e.g.
 * `ifcopenshell-schema-conformance.test.ts` on a TS-only PR, where CI never
 * installs Python) must not outrank a genuinely observed change and block a
 * well-tested PR. That was a real regression #4108's fix (#4131) introduced.
 *
 * Returns the subset of `results` that should decide the aggregate's worst
 * kind: with real evidence present, ALL_SKIPPED entries are dropped from the
 * severity walk (their counts and evidence still fold into the caller's
 * totals via its own `sum`/`flatMap` over the FULL `results` array, unfiltered
 * — only the *verdict-deciding* kind ignores them). With no real evidence
 * anywhere, every result — ALL_SKIPPED included — stays a candidate, so a
 * single-package or an every-package all-skipped run still poisons to
 * ALL_SKIPPED exactly as before.
