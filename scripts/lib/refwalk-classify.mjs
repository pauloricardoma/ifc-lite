/**
 * Pure classification step for the refwalk gate (issue #2944). The gate that
 * consumes it is `scripts/check-refwalk-guards.mjs`, whose header carries the
 * measured coverage and the LIMITATIONS block; nothing here decides pass or
 * fail. Given the text of ONE Rust source file, decides which of its
 * functions are "reference-following recursive walks" that call
 * `decode_by_id` / `resolve_ref` / `resolve_ref_list`, as opposed to
 * ordinary bounded iteration over a fixed list that happens to call the
 * same decode functions.
 *
 * The distinguishing signal used here is NOT "is there a loop" (the naive
 * shape from issue #2944's Option 1, which flags every `for` loop around a
 * decode call — including bounded ones) but "is the enclosing function part
 * of a local call cycle" — i.e. self-recursion or mutual recursion among
 * functions defined in the same file. A `for edge in edges { decode_by_id
 * (edge) }` loop over a list bound before the loop never calls itself, so it
 * is not part of any cycle in the local call graph and is not flagged. A
 * walk that re-enters itself (directly, or via a sibling `_inner`/`_guarded`
 * helper) to chase an attribute reference IS part of a cycle, and is
 * flagged regardless of whether it happens to also contain a `for`.
 *
 * This is a purely lexical, single-file, name-based approximation — it does
 * not resolve types, does not follow calls across files, and can be fooled
 * by shadowing or by a same-named function in an unrelated impl block. Read
 * `scripts/check-refwalk-guards.mjs`'s LIMITATIONS block before assuming any
 * coverage from it -- in particular it cannot see a recursion cycle that
 * spans two files, which is why #2870's Boolean <-> CSG cycle is missed.
 *
 * The gate calls `extractFunctions` and `findWalkCandidates` only.
 * `classifyFile`, `findRecursiveFunctions` and `findChaseLoopFunctions` are
 * the measurement API the feasibility study was built on, kept because their
 * tests are what pin the shared internals (`callSitePresent`'s cross-struct
 * name-collision rule, `chaseLoopBodyMatches`' fixed point) that
 * `findWalkCandidates` sits on top of. Editing one of them does not change
 * what CI enforces.

/**
 * The "chase loop" signal (the gap named in issue #2944's follow-up): a
 * `for`/`while`/`loop` whose body reassigns an EXISTING variable (no `let`)
 * from `decode_by_id`/`resolve_ref`/`resolve_ref_list`, where that same
 * variable also appears elsewhere in the loop body as the receiver of a
 * `.get(`/`.get_ref(` attribute access -- i.e. the next id chased comes from
 * an attribute OF the thing the loop just decoded, not from a list bound
 * before the loop started.
 *
 * True positive shape (probe.rs's `extract_extrusion_direction_recursive`,
 * despite its `_recursive` name):
 *   for _depth in 0..MAX_EXTRUSION_EXTRACT_DEPTH {
 *       let source_attr = current.get(0)?;               // current.get(
 *       let source = decoder.resolve_ref(source_attr)...; // current = decoder...(
 *       ...
 *       current = decoder.resolve_ref(source_attr).ok()??;
 *   }
 *
 * Rejected shape (edge_loop.rs's bounded iteration over a pre-bound list):
 *   for edge_ref in edges {
 *       let edge_id = edge_ref.as_entity_ref().unwrap();
 *       let oriented_edge = decoder.decode_by_id(edge_id).unwrap();  // `let`, not reassignment
 *   }
 * The `let` there creates a FRESH binding each iteration; the loop variable
 * `edge_ref` itself is never reassigned. Requiring the decode-driven
 * assignment to be a plain (non-`let`) mutation of a pre-existing variable
 * is what rejects this shape.
 *
 * The decode call feeding the cursor reassignment is often not in the SAME
 * statement -- `processors/boolean/mod.rs`'s `collect_polygonal_chain` does
 * `let Ok(Some(first)) = decoder.resolve_ref(first_attr) else { break };`
 * then, as a separate statement, `current = first;`. To catch that, this
 * builds a small transitive "decoded" set: any `let PATTERN = RHS;` (or
 * `let PATTERN = RHS else { ... };`) binding whose RHS either directly
 * contains a decode call, OR references a variable already in the set, adds
 * every identifier in PATTERN to the set (fixed-point iteration, so a
 * 3-deep chain like `items` <- decode call, `first` <- `items.next()`,
 * `current` <- `first` all resolve). A bare (non-`let`) reassignment
 * `X = RHS;` is then flagged as the chase step when RHS either directly
 * contains a decode call or references a decoded-set variable, AND `X`
 * separately appears in the loop body as `X.get(...)`/`X.get_ref(...)`.
 *
 * This is deliberately lexical/co-occurrence based -- it does not verify
 * that the SPECIFIC id passed to the decode call was produced by the
 * SPECIFIC `.get(...)` access on the same variable earlier in the body,
 * only that both happen somewhere in the same loop. Not observed to
 * misfire over rust/geometry/src (see the feasibility report), but a loop
 * that reassigns a cursor from a decode call for one reason while
 * separately, coincidentally, reading a `.get(...)` attribute off the same
 * variable name for an unrelated reason would be a false positive under
 * this rule.
 *
 * Guardedness (a `visited` set, a depth counter comparison, or a bounded
 * `0..MAX_*` / `0..CONST` range) is measured and reported separately
 * (`guarded` field) but does NOT gate whether a function is flagged --
 * same policy `findRecursiveFunctions` already uses for guarded recursive
 * walks (`sample_curve_polyline_guarded` is flagged in this file's tests
 * despite carrying both a depth AND a visited guard). A "flag" here means
 * "candidate reference-following walk, worth an allowlist entry / review",
 * not "confirmed unguarded bug" -- the maintainer's literal Option 1
 * wording ("without a visited or depth binding in scope") is answered by
 * the `guarded` field, not by suppressing the flag.
