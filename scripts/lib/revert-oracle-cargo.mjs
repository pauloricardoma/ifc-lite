 *

 * (`"..."` and `'...'`) and an accidental trailing slash (`"rust/python/"`)
 * are accepted, since either would otherwise silently produce an empty list
 * and quietly reintroduce #4104. A full TOML parse would be more correct
 * still (e.g. it would also accept an exclude list split across `+=` or a
 * dotted-key form), but no manifest in this repo uses those, so the residual
 * risk is limited to a shape nobody has written.
