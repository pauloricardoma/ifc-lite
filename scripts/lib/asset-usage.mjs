/**
 * Pure detection logic for check-asset-usage.mjs, split out so it can be
 * tested against synthetic fixtures instead of this checkout's own state
 * (the module-size and refwalk gates split the same way, for the same
 * reason: the CLI wrapper drives real `git ls-files`, the test drives this).
 *
 * An asset under the scanned directory (apps/viewer/public, at the call
 * site) is "referenced" if some OTHER tracked text file in the repo — any
 * file, not just source: index.html, manifest.json, vercel.json, docs,
 * CSS, E2E specs all count — contains the asset's basename, its
 * scan-relative path, or that path with a leading "/" (the root-absolute
 * form a static-asset directory is served under). That is a substring
 * search, not a parsed reference graph: it is deliberately permissive, so
 * the gate's failure mode is a missed dead file, never a live one flagged
 * as dead.
 */

/**
 * Extensions worth reading as text for the substring search. Deliberately
 * broad — docs (.md), configs (.json/.yml/.toml), markup (.html) and styles
 * (.css) have all been real consumers in this repo's history. `.mts`/`.cts`
 * are TypeScript too (tools/demo-kit/derive-variants.mts builds
 * apps/viewer/public/samples/* paths at lines ~116-120) — omitting them left
 * a live-asset-flagged-dead trap: the only thing stopping a false positive
 * today is that those sample names are also spelled out in
 * apps/viewer/src/lib/tours/demo-kit.ts and AGENTS.md, both already-covered
 * extensions. `.sh`/`.py` are deliberately NOT added here: none of them
 * reference a path under apps/viewer/public today (checked by grepping this
 * repo's tracked .sh/.py files for every current asset's basename), so
 * adding them would only cost scan time for an extension this scan dir has
 * no current consumer in. `.rs` is NOT added either, but for a different
 * reason: two Rust tests (rust/processing/tests/instancing_dont_bake.rs and
 * rust/geometry/tests/clash_intersection_real_model.rs) do reference
 * apps/viewer/public sample paths, so omitting `.rs` is a live gap, not an
 * empty one — it stays safe only because both referenced assets
 * (hello-wall.ifc, infra-bridge.ifc) are also referenced from an
 * already-covered extension (apps/viewer/src/components/mcp/McpPlayground.tsx).
 * Adding `.rs` was tried and rejected: Rust test fixtures reuse generic
 * basenames like "manifest.json" for their own unrelated corpora, so a
 * basename-only substring search over ~800 .rs files pulls in matches that
 * have nothing to do with apps/viewer/public — noise without closing the
 * gap, since the two real .rs references above are already covered
 * elsewhere. If that TSX reference is ever removed, this exclusion needs
 * re-checking.
