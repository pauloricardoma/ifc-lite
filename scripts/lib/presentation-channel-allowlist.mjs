/**
 * The DATA half of `scripts/check-isolate-expansion-routing.mjs` (#3338): which
 * store actions are policed, which files are known channels, and the reason
 * recorded against each exemption.
 *
 * Split out of the gate when widening it from the two isolation actions to
 * hide/show/colour tripled the allowlist prose and pushed the single file past
 * its module-size budget. The gate keeps the LOGIC (how a call site is
 * classified); this file keeps the JUDGEMENTS (which call sites are fine, and
 * why) -- the half a reviewer actually has to read and check, and the half
 * that grows every time a channel is added.
 */

/**
 * Every store action this gate polices, and which channel kind it actuates.
 *
 * Isolation was the whole list until #3338 routed the SIBLING channels. That
 * was the wrong boundary and the gate's own history says so: it watched
 * `isolateEntities` alone until a channel dodged it for free by picking
 * `setIsolatedEntities` (`useEmbedUrlParams.ts`). `hideEntities`,
 * `showEntities` and `updateMeshColors` are the same trap one step further
 * out -- all three write ids the renderer matches against MESH ids, so a
 * geometry-less `IfcElementAssembly` id in any of them is a silent no-op
 * (`hiddenEntities` never matches; a colour lands on nothing), and a NEW file
 * that hides or colours raw user-picked ids was previously invisible here.
 *
 * `setPendingColorUpdates` -- the OTHER colour actuator, used by the lens,
 * IDS, clash, schedule-overlay and SDK channels -- is deliberately NOT in
 * this list yet. It has 31 call sites across 14 files, most of them
 * ownership/restore sequences in subsystems this gate's author has not
 * audited, and adding it without that audit would mean 14 allowlist entries
 * whose reasons are guesses. Stating the gap with its measured size, rather
 * than either silently omitting it or papering it with invented
 * justifications: a channel that actuates colour through
 * `setPendingColorUpdates` can still be added without this gate seeing it.
