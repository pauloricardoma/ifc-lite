/**
 * Python support for the revert oracle (`scripts/check-test-revert-oracle.mjs`).
 *
 * Split out of `revert-oracle.mjs` to keep that file at its recorded
 * module-size budget (#4050): classifying a `test_*.py` file as a test needed
 * only a regex change there, but actually running one needs a project-owner
 * lookup (mirroring `cargoTestOwner` in `revert-oracle-cargo.mjs`), a runner,
 * and an output parser — enough surface to earn its own file.
 *
 * WHY A PROJECT-OWNER WALK, LIKE CARGO. A Python test file carries no manifest
 * of its own the way a JS test's nearest `package.json` does. `pythonTestOwner`
 * walks up from the test file looking for the nearest recognised project
 * marker — e.g. `tools/ifcopenshell_reference/requirements.lock` or
 * `rust/python/pyproject.toml` — and runs pytest from there. A Cargo-backed
 * Python project is marked for a fresh wheel build in each source state.
 * A test file with no such marker above it is left `unassigned` by the
 * caller rather than guessed at, the same refusal `cargoTestOwner`'s caller
 * applies to a `.rs` file with no owning crate.
 *
 * WHY `python3 -m pytest`, NOT A BARE `pytest` ON PATH. `-m` fails
 * predictably and legibly when pytest is not installed for that interpreter
 * (see `parsePython` and `PYTEST_MISSING_PATTERN` below), and runs under
 * whichever interpreter `python3` resolves to (or its wheel venv). This mirrors `cargoRunner`
 * always shelling out to a bare `cargo` and letting `spawnSync`'s ENOENT speak
 * for a missing toolchain — an absent `python3` itself is caught the same
 * generic way, via `run.spawnError` in `parseRunnerOutput`.
