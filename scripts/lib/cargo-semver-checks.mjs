/**
 * ONE `cargo-semver-checks` run: how to ask, and what the answer means.
 *
 * Split out of `scripts/check-rust-semver.mjs` when the executed-lint floor
 * landed (#4786). The two halves are one invariant and had drifted apart while
 * they shared a file: how much the tool compares is decided by an ARGUMENT
 * (`--release-type`), and what its summary line is allowed to mean depends on
 * that same argument. Reading `Summary no semver update required` as "at most a
 * patch is required" is only sound because the run asked about a patch. Keeping
 * the argv here, beside the parse that depends on it, is the point of the
 * split, not a side effect of the line limit.
 *
 * Everything here is about the tool. What to DO with a verdict — which crates,
 * which baseline, which bump the version carries, and whether a crate may be
 * cleared — is release policy and stays in `check-rust-semver.mjs`.
 *
 * Tests live with the gate's, in `scripts/check-rust-semver.test.mjs`.

/**
 * The release size `cargo-semver-checks` is told to assume, instead of letting
 * it infer one from the manifest version against the baseline (#4786).
 *
 * The tool only runs the lints that could refuse the release it thinks it is
 * being asked about, so the inferred level decides how much gets compared, and
 * a release that already carries a big bump is compared against nothing.
 * Measured on `ifc-lite-clash`, baseline the published 14.0.0, manifests at
 * 15.0.0, cargo-semver-checks 0.50.0:
 *
 *   inferred (no flag)      0 checks: 0 pass, 254 skip   "no semver update required"
 *   --release-type minor  196 checks: 196 pass, 58 skip  "no semver update required"
 *   --release-type patch  223 checks: 223 pass, 31 skip  "no semver update required"
 *
 * So `patch` and not `minor`: at `minor` the tool still skips the 27 lints that
 * only a minor could fail (a new `pub` item), and a minor-requiring change
 * would come back as `no semver update required` — which [[interpretRun]] reads
 * as `patch`, and the gate would then wave through under a patch release.
 * `patch` is the smallest release there is, so it selects every lint the tool
 * is prepared to fail on and the verdict returned is the true minimum the
 * change requires. Judging that against the bump the version actually carries
 * is the GATE's job (`RANK` in check-rust-semver.mjs), and it is the part that
 * was being handed to the tool and lost.
 *
 * NOT every lint, even so: 223 of 254, because the other 31 carry
 * `lint_level: Allow` in cargo-semver-checks' own lint definitions and are
 * dropped at EVERY release type. Nothing this gate passes reaches them. That is
 * why the floor downstream is on a count above zero and not on a count of 254.
