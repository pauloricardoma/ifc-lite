/**
 * "DID THIS REVIEW RECORD SEE THIS COMMIT?" -- asked only of fields that do not
 * move. Issues #3729 and #3730.
 *
 * Three predicates in this repository answered that question the same wrong
 * way: by comparing `commit_id` on `pulls/{n}/comments` to the PR head. THAT
 * FIELD IS RELOCATED ONTO A LATER HEAD. A row written against an older commit
 * reports a newer one, so the comparison returns `true` for a comment written
 * before the commit it names existed.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT REASONED. `LTplus-AG/ifc-lite`, 2026-09-03, every open PR (36):
 * of 75 inline review comments, 14 were WRITTEN at their PR's head
 * (`original_commit_id === head`) and 36 more merely REPORT it. Counting
 * `commit_id === head` returns 50 where 14 qualify -- a 3.6x inflation of
 * "reviewed at head" on this repository's own traffic.
 *
 * THE FOUR FACTS THIS MODULE RESTS ON, EACH ONE OBSERVED:
 *
 *   1. ON A FORCE-PUSH, `commit_id` MOVES AND THE OTHER TWO DO NOT. PR #3719
 *      (merged), head `b7352e6d0` committed 2026-09-02T18:59:03Z:
 *
 *        endpoint              field                value       moved?
 *        pulls/3719/comments   commit_id            b7352e6d0   YES (= head)
 *        pulls/3719/comments   original_commit_id   fecc421e9   no
 *        pulls/3719/comments   created_at           17:30:48Z   no
 *        pulls/3719/reviews    commit_id            fecc421e9   no
 *
 *      That comment was written 88 minutes before the commit its `commit_id`
 *      names. The review EVENT for the same pass still names `fecc421e9`.
 *
 *   2. IT IS NOT A FORCE-PUSH HAZARD (louistrue, on #3729: "force-push is not
 *      the only trigger"), AND THE FIELD WAS WATCHED MOVING. PR #3610 carries
 *      three comments posted by `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]` in ONE batch at
 *      2026-09-01T08:18:46Z, all with `original_commit_id` `260a6aeea`. Read
 *      twice on 2026-09-03, hours apart, while the PR took ordinary
 *      fast-forward pushes:
 *
 *        read      PR head      the three rows' `commit_id`
 *        first     411d93b40    260a6aeea, 260a6aeea, 411d93b40
 *        second    bf323cc71    260a6aeea, 260a6aeea, bf323cc71
 *
 *      The SAME row reported a different commit on the second read, and
 *      `original_commit_id` and `created_at` were byte-identical both times. So
 *      `commit_id` is a POINTER THAT TRACKS THE HEAD, not a record of what was
 *      reviewed -- and it moves on a subset of a batch, so nothing about a
 *      sibling row predicts it. This module therefore claims NO mechanism and
 *      needs none: both fields it reads are correct whether GitHub relocates a
 *      row or a bot re-posts one, because a re-posted row is a genuinely new
 *      row with its own `original_commit_id` and `created_at`.
 *
 *   3. `commit_id` DOES NOT EVEN RELOCATE TO THE *CURRENT* HEAD RELIABLY. On PR
 *      #3389 (head `9c79d14d1`) a comment with `original_commit_id`
 *      `3b176b9e1` reports `c85c0f499` -- an intermediate commit. So
 *      `commit_id !== head` is not a sound negative either, and the field is
 *      unusable for provenance in both directions, not merely optimistic.
 *
 *   4. THE CLOCK IS A ONE-WAY PROOF AND THE OTHER DIRECTION IS NOT
 *      HYPOTHETICAL. PR #3595's head was committed 14:48:28Z; two of its
 *      comments were created at 14:48:41Z and 14:48:51Z -- AFTER the head
 *      commit -- and were written against `68b13a657`, not the head. So
 *      "created before the head commit" proves a row did not see the head, and
 *      "created after" proves nothing at all.
 *
 * SO THE TWO USABLE FACTS, AND WHAT EACH CAN AND CANNOT ANSWER:
 *
 *   `original_commit_id === headSha`  is the ONLY positive evidence that an
 *   inline row was written against the head. It is frozen (fact 1). Nothing
 *   else on that endpoint can assert it: `commit_id` relocates, and a timestamp
 *   cannot say WHICH commit was read.
 *
 *   `created_at`/`submitted_at` < head commit time  is PROOF that a record did
 *   not see the head: it predates the commit. Independent of anchoring, and
 *   one-way only (fact 4). It corroborates the SHA rather than replacing it.
 *
 *   AND IT ASSUMES ONE THING, WHICH IS WORTH NAMING RATHER THAN CALLING IT
 *   "monotone": the two sides are not read from the same clock.
 *   `created_at`/`submitted_at` are GitHub's, and `commit.committer.date` is
 *   whatever clock made the commit -- a developer's laptop, unless GitHub made
 *   it itself (a squash, "Update branch", an applied suggestion). A committing
 *   machine running AHEAD by more than the review-to-push gap could therefore
 *   make a review that did see the tree look older than it. Every other skew
 *   direction only loses true positives. That asymmetry is a reason to keep the
 *   SHA carrying the finding and the clock corroborating it, which is what the
 *   callers do -- and at `staleReviewSeverity: warn` a skewed clock can only
 *   mis-word a sentence, never move an exit code.
 *
 * Review EVENTS (`pulls/{n}/reviews`) are a different surface with a different
 * answer: their `commit_id` is frozen (fact 1), so it IS usable, which is why
 * `staleReviews` in pr-review-signal.mjs reads that endpoint and this module
 * only lends it the clock.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no `gh`, no clock of its own. Every caller supplies the head
 * and the head's commit time.
