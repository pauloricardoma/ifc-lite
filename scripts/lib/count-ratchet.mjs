/**
 * The comparison under a count ratchet: a measured `{ key: count }` map
 * against a committed baseline of the same shape. Shared by
 * `scripts/check-jsx-a11y.mjs` (key = source file, count = jsx-a11y
 * warnings) and the axe scan in `tests/e2e/axe-baseline.ts` (key = axe rule
 * id, count = violating nodes, `region` as present/absent), so both gates
 * agree on what "went up" and "went down" mean (#5607).
 *
 * A count ABOVE its row is a regression; a count BELOW its row (including a
 * key that is gone entirely) is an improvement. A key missing from the
 * baseline has an allowance of zero. What an improvement MEANS is the
 * caller's policy: the axe scan fails on it (a fixed rule must leave its
 * baseline, #5607's acceptance), while check-jsx-a11y.mjs only reports it
 * (see that file's header for why a stale per-file row must not turn main
 * red).
 *
 * @param {Record<string, number>} counts   measured now; zero-count keys may be omitted
 * @param {Record<string, number>} baseline committed allowance
 * @returns {{
 *   regressions: Array<{ key: string, count: number, allowed: number }>,
 *   improvements: Array<{ key: string, count: number, allowed: number }>,
 * }} both sorted by key
