/**
 * Regression harness for scripts/check-clash-degenerate-reason-parity.mjs.
 *
 * A parity gate that silently matches nothing is worse than no gate, so each
 * way it could go false-green is an executable case here: a reason removed from
 * the TS union, a reason added on the Rust side, and either extractor broken so
 * it returns the empty set (the vacuity guard — two empty sets are "equal").
 *
 * Method matches scripts/check-server-bin-targets.test.mjs: mutate a copy of
 * the REAL sources in a temp tree outside the repo, run the UNMODIFIED checker
 * against it via `--root`, and assert exit code plus message. Every mutation
 * anchor is asserted to exist in the real input first, so a drifted anchor
 * fails the suite instead of quietly testing nothing.
 *
 * Run: node --test scripts/check-clash-degenerate-reason-parity.test.mjs
 * (wired as a step of the CI node-test job in .github/workflows/test.yml).
