/**
 * Ratchet: a test may not read its own subject's SOURCE and assert on the text
 * (#2434).
 *
 * A test that does `readFileSync('Thing.tsx')` and then `.includes('someCall(')`
 * certifies that a string exists, not that the code works. It is weak in both
 * directions — green while the behaviour is broken, red on a harmless rename.
 * The measured case: `SearchModal.filter.wiring.test.tsx` asserted the whole body
 * of `handleRowClick`, and stayed 5/5 green when `onRowClick={handleRowClick}`
 * was replaced with `onRowClick={() => {}}` — defect #2396 verbatim, a click
 * that does nothing.
 *
 * The pattern kept spreading because the alternative looked impossible: three
 * test files carried the same sentence, "reads the store directly via
 * `useViewerStore`, so it cannot be mounted under `tsx --test`". That was never
 * true; what was true is that two Vite-isms broke the import, and nobody had
 * paid the one-time cost of fixing them. `apps/viewer/src/test/` now does
 * (`vite-module-hooks.mjs`, `dom-layout.ts`, `render.tsx`, `store-fixture.ts`),
 * and AGENTS.md documents the recipe.
 *
 * So this guard exists to stop NEW ones landing while the existing list is
 * converted. Everything already in the allowlist is grandfathered with a reason;
 * the file is expected to shrink and must never grow.
 *
 * Run via `node scripts/check-source-text-assertions.mjs` (CI node-test job).
 *
 * DETECTION is deliberately lexical, not data-flow: every real instance names
 * its subject in a string literal in the same file, though often through a
 * shared `readSource('Thing.tsx')` helper, so the read and the literal cannot
 * be required to sit near each other.
 *
 * COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy: three
 * unrelated tests mention a `.ts` filename in prose ("as per `safe-path.test.ts`",
 * "apache-arrow hides the `.d.ts`") while reading a wasm binary or a JSON
 * manifest, and matching those flagged all three. It is the same trap the test
 * this guard was born from fell into -- an assertion that matched its own
 * explanatory comment instead of the code.

These read a source file and assert on its text. That certifies a string

Write a behavioural test instead. For viewer components the harness is ready:

  import { installLayout } from '@/test/dom-layout.js';
  installLayout();                       // only if the component virtualizes

  import { fixtureModel, fixtureModels } from '@/test/store-fixture.js';

  useViewerStore.setState({ ...fixtureModels(fixtureModel('m')) });
  const ui = render(<YourComponent />);
  click(/* the thing a user clicks */);
  assert.equal(useViewerStore.getState().somethingObservable, expected);

See AGENTS.md ("Testing a viewer component") and
apps/viewer/src/components/viewer/SearchModal.filter.wiring.test.tsx.

If the behavioural version is genuinely out of reach, add the file to
scripts/source-text-assertion-allowlist.txt WITH a one-line reason.
