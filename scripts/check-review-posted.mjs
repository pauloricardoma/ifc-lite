/**
 * A REVIEW THAT DID NOT POST IS NOT A REVIEW, AND THE JOB'S EXIT CODE CANNOT
 * TELL YOU WHICH HAPPENED.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `anthropics/claude-code-action` has at least three OPEN,
 * confirmed paths that report success while reviewing nothing, verified in its
 * tracker on 2026-08-31:
 *
 *   - #1644 (bug, p1, 2026-08-13) "Agent exits success after 5-10 turns without
 *     completing the review (silent no-op)". Roughly half of runs return
 *     `is_error: false` with a low `num_turns`, so an `is_error` guard cannot
 *     see it.
 *   - #1679 (bug, p2, 2026-08-16) "post-buffered-inline-comments exits 0 after
 *     failing to post every comment". Reported as FORTY CONSECUTIVE RUNS logging
 *     `Posted 0/N` and reporting success: the review ran, findings existed, and
 *     zero comments reached the pull request.
 *   - An unguarded `num_turns: 0` path.
 *
 * None of the three is credential-specific, so paying for an API key instead of
 * using a subscription does not close any of them.
 *
 * That is the same defect this repository has already paid for from the other
 * side: 174 of 830 merged PRs in August 2026 (21%, 46,717 lines) carried no
 * review of any kind while showing green, and #3175 then had to correct TWELVE
 * changesets by hand that would have shipped breaking changes as `patch`, with
 * the release one command from publishing. ABSENCE MUST NOT READ AS SUCCESS.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE REFUSES TO ACCEPT AS EVIDENCE, and why each is not enough:
 *
 *   - THE JOB'S EXIT CODE. #1644 and #1679 both exit 0.
 *   - STRUCTURED OUTPUT / a `--json-schema` result. #1679 satisfies the schema
 *     and drops every comment on the floor afterwards. The schema describes what
 *     the model PRODUCED, not what the pull request RECEIVED.
 *   - A COMMENT EXISTING AT ALL. A comment from an earlier head is not a review
 *     of this one, and GitHub relocates a bot comment's `commit_id` onto a
 *     later head -- with or without a force-push -- so THAT field cannot say
 *     which diff was read (#3729). The frozen `original_commit_id` can, and the
 *     findings cross-check uses it -- but the VERDICT still turns on a marker
 *     naming the reviewed commit, because nothing relocates that.
 *
 * THE ONE THING IT DOES ACCEPT is a marker the reviewer writes at the END of a
 * successful post, naming the exact commit it reviewed:
 *
 *     <!-- ifc-lite-review sha=<40-hex> verdict=<token> count=<n> -->
 *
 *     The tokens, and what each buys, are in ./lib/review-marker.mjs.
 *
 *     An optional trailing ` omitted=<n>` (present only when n > 0) records how
 *     many changed files were too large to fit the model prompt and were NOT
 *     reviewed (#3679). The verdict then covers only the files that were.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT THIS IMPLIES, and it is the load-bearing half: THE REVIEWER MUST
 * POST ON EVERY RUN, INCLUDING WHEN IT FINDS NOTHING. A reviewer that stays
 * silent when clean makes "reviewed and found nothing" byte-identical to "never
 * ran", which is the exact trap CodeRabbit falls into here (it publishes no
 * review event on a clean pass, which is why scripts/pr-review-signal.config.json
 * ships `staleReviewPolicy: "off"` -- absence of a review object is not evidence
 * of staleness for THAT reviewer, and cannot be made into evidence). We control
 * our own reviewer, so we take the other branch: it always speaks, and silence
 * therefore means failure. This gate is only meaningful because of that.
 *
 * FAILURE CLASSES, each with its own remedy, because a remedy that contradicts
 * its finding is worse than no remedy:
 *
 *   NOT_POSTED       No marker from any expected author. The action reported
 *                    whatever it reported; nothing reached the PR.
 *                    REMEDY: re-run the review job. If it recurs, the run log
 *                    will show `Posted 0/N` (#1679) or a low `num_turns`
 *                    (#1644); attach it to the issue rather than re-running
 *                    forever.
 *   STALE_REVIEW     A marker exists but names a different commit. The reviewer
 *                    read an earlier head. REMEDY: re-run; do not read the older
 *                    verdict as covering this diff.
 *   MARKER_MALFORMED A marker is present and unparseable. Treated as absence,
 *                    never as a pass. REMEDY: fix the reviewer's marker writer.
 *   NO_PR / NO_REPO / NO_SHA / BAD_CONFIG / GH_*  Broken invocation or an
 *                    unreadable input. REMEDY is per message; all fail closed.
 *
 * STATED HOLES, so nobody reads a green here as more than it is:
 *
 *   1. It proves a comment was POSTED naming this SHA. It proves nothing about
 *      whether the review was any GOOD. Precision is a separate instrument.
 *   2. A reviewer that posts a marker and an empty body satisfies this gate. The
 *      marker is written by our own reviewer, so this is a trust boundary we
 *      own, not one an outside contributor can cross -- but it is a boundary.
 *   3. It cannot distinguish "the model had nothing to say" from "the model was
 *      throttled into saying nothing but still posted". If the review lane is
 *      funded by a consumer subscription whose pool can drain, the reviewer must
 *      itself fail rather than post an empty clean verdict; this gate cannot
 *      recover that distinction after the fact.
 *   4. Comment pagination is bounded (MAX_PAGES x PER_PAGE). A PR busier than
 *      that fails closed with COMMENTS_TRUNCATED rather than guessing.
 *   5. It waits for the marker (POLL_SECONDS up to the timeout) because a
 *      comment does not fire `pull_request`. On expiry NOT_POSTED is the true
 *      answer at that moment, not a timeout dressed up as one.

 * marker lands: posting a comment does not raise a `pull_request` event. A
 * single-read version is therefore RED ON EVERY PUSH and green only after a
 * human clicks re-run -- 1,200 manual re-runs a month here, which is how a gate
 * stops being read at all. Advisory mode hides this completely, so it would have
 * shipped broken on the day it was flipped to enforcing.

 * So it waits, the way scripts/check-pr-review-signal.mjs waits for lanes. The
 * budget is the honest question "has the reviewer had a fair chance yet", not a
