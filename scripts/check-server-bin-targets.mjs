/**
 * A server-bin release must carry one archive per platform the package
 * claims to support - and nothing verified that until v1.16.6 shipped
 * without ifc-lite-server-win32-x64.zip (issue #2619).
 *
 * Three functional lists encode the platform set and agreed only by hand:
 *
 *   1. SUPPORTED_TARGETS in packages/server-bin/src/platform.ts - the six
 *      real target triples the install-time resolver accepts.
 *   2. `os` / `cpu` in packages/server-bin/package.json - what npm gates
 *      installs on. This is a strictly COARSER cross-product than the
 *      triples: it admits win32-arm64 (npm checks os and cpu independently)
 *      and cannot express linux-x64-musl at all. So the invariant is not
 *      triple-for-triple: `os` must equal the set of platform prefixes in
 *      SUPPORTED_TARGETS, and `cpu` must equal the set of arches with any
 *      `-musl` suffix stripped.
 *   3. The `release-server-binaries` matrix in
 *      .github/workflows/server-binaries.yml - what actually gets built and
 *      uploaded. Its target set must equal SUPPORTED_TARGETS, each entry's
 *      `archive` must match the resolver's naming rule (win32 => zip, else
 *      tar.gz), and each entry's `rust-target` must be the triple the
 *      install target actually needs - a wrong triple ships an incompatible
 *      binary under a perfectly valid archive name (arm64 bits as x64).
 *      The upload step must also use the literal
 *      `ifc-lite-server-${{ matrix.target }}.${{ matrix.archive }}`
 *      expression, which is what makes the uploaded name provably the same
 *      string the resolver downloads rather than agreeing by luck.
 *
 * The `validate-server-binaries` matrix is a deliberate cost-saving SUBSET
 * (linux only), so it is checked as a subset, not for equality.
 *
 * With `--release <tag>` the script instead asserts the published release
 * carries every expected asset by name, so a failed matrix leg cannot
 * leave a silent hole. The expected set is read from the TAG'S OWN
 * platform.ts (`git show refs/tags/<tag>:...`), not from the checked-out
 * tree: a manual backfill dispatch checks out the workflow ref (main), and
 * as the platform set drifts, main's SUPPORTED_TARGETS would demand
 * archives an old release never claimed to ship (a false red on exactly
 * the repair path this check exists for) or miss ones it still needs (a
 * false green). The .sha256 sidecar expectation is keyed off the tag the
 * same way: expected exactly when the tag's own workflow publishes
 * sidecars, so pre-sidecar releases stay verifiable while a newer release
 * cannot silently drop one (checksum.ts fails closed for those versions).
 * The checked-out tree still gets the full source-parity check first, and
 * the checker code itself always runs from the workflow ref.
 *
 * Fail-closed: an unfindable list, a parse yielding no entries, an
 * unreadable/empty release asset list, or a release tag whose ref is not
 * available locally is an ERROR, never a vacuous pass. In particular an
 * absent tag ref tells the operator to fetch it instead of silently
 * falling back to the checked-out tree's target set - and that case is
 * distinguished structurally (not by git's error prose) from a tag that IS
 * fetched but simply predates a file, which is a fact about the revision:
 * see scripts/lib/server-bin-tag-read.mjs.
 *
 * Source-text matching is comment-aware (rationale in
 * scripts/lib/server-bin-targets-parse.mjs); the upload check (in
 * scripts/lib/server-bin-upload-check.mjs) binds the asset and sidecar
 * literals to the actual `gh release upload` arguments. Executable proof:
 * scripts/check-server-bin-targets.test.mjs, which drives this script via
 * `--root <dir>` against hostile mutations of the real inputs.
