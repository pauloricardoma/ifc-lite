/**
 * Module-size ratchet for TypeScript and Node scripts — the non-Rust half of
 * the rule that `rust/processing/tests/module_size_ratchet.rs` already
 * enforces for Rust.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the Rust gate's `collect_rs_files` filters on
 * `extension == "rs"`, and the allowlist it reads is Rust-only, so the
 * AGENTS.md "split modules over ~400 non-generated lines" rule had *no*
 * executable enforcement at all on the TypeScript side. That gap has already
 * demonstrated itself: `packages/export/src/step-serialization.ts` was taken
 * to 389 lines by #2507 and drifted back over 400 with nothing to stop it
 * (#2475). A redesign that splits a god file re-grows unless something holds
 * the new shape.
 *
 * The gate has two teeth, identical to the Rust one:
 *  1. A NEW non-generated, non-test TS/TSX/MJS/CJS file that crosses 400 lines
 *     and has no allowlist row fails. This is the load-bearing guarantee: no
 *     new god files.
 *  2. An allowlisted file that GROWS past its recorded budget fails. Existing
 *     debt is frozen; a listed file may stay flat or shrink, never grow.
 *
 * Shrinking a file to <= 400 lets you delete its row, and the gate says so.
 * Budgets ratchet DOWN by default: prefer shrinking or splitting to raising
 * one. A raise is not forbidden, it is deliberate -- `--update --allow-raise`,
 * justified per file in the PR -- and the allowlist header says the same. The
 * two must keep saying the same thing: a reviewer reaches whichever copy sits
 * in the file they are editing, and #3398 was filed because they disagreed.
 *
 * THERE IS NO DIGEST PIN (removed by #3745). Earlier revisions stored a
 * per-scope hash of the allowlist's rows in this file (`ALLOWLIST_DIGESTS`)
 * so that any edit to a row had to move a second, separately-committed line.
 * That pin is a pure function of the allowlist's own content — deriving it
 * from the file it guards and then storing the derived value back in a
 * DIFFERENT file bought nothing a reviewer could read (a 20-digit FNV-1a hash
 * says nothing about whether a raise is justified; the allowlist row diff
 * already says that, in plain English, on its own) — while costing real
 * contention: 316 of 362 rows sit at zero headroom, so most PRs touching an
 * allowlisted file rewrote their scope's single pinned line, and two PRs in
 * the SAME scope always collided there even when their row edits were on
 * disjoint, non-adjacent lines (#3745). It caused two red mains (#3689/#3723,
 * #3712/#3735) and three separate branch conflicts in one evening. The two
 * teeth above are unchanged and still the only things that fail the gate; the
 * allowlist row diff is still visible in every PR, exactly as it was before.
 * THE RUST TWIN STILL HAS ITS PIN (`ALLOWLIST_DIGESTS` in
 * rust/processing/tests/module_size_ratchet.rs), so the two gates deliberately
 * disagree for now: its table is 6 entries against the 38 this file used to pin, and its allowlist is
 * a fraction of the size, so it has not shown the contention #3745 measured on
 * this side. Retiring it is a separate, deferred change, not an oversight in
 * this one -- a reader landing in that header first should not conclude this
 * one is stale.
 *
 * WIRED INTO CI in the node-tests job of .github/workflows/test.yml, next to
 * the other source-shape gates. The initial allowlist grandfathers 312 files
 * and embodies a judgement about what counts as production TypeScript.
 *
 * The allowlist is a SNAPSHOT of the tree it was recorded from, so growth that
 * lands on main afterwards — from any PR, including ones this branch never
 * touched — makes the gate red on a long-lived branch. That is a DIFFERENT red
 * from the one your own change causes, and the two do not share a remedy:
 *
 *   Growth YOUR change caused — re-record it with
 *   `pnpm lint:module-size-baseline`, in the same commit that grows the file.
 *
 *   Growth INHERITED from main, after a merge — the scoped command cannot fix
 *   this one. That growth is by definition outside the files your change
 *   touched, so the run reports success and leaves the gate red. It takes
 *   `--update --all --allow-raise`: `--all` to reach outside your scope, and
 *   `--allow-raise` because re-recording a file that grew IS a raise and the
 *   command refuses one unless asked twice. Without it, `--update --all` writes
 *   nothing and exits 1 the moment any file grew -- on a shrink-only tree it
 *   succeeds, which is why "it always refuses" would be the wrong thing to
 *   remember. It re-records every stale row in the tree on the way
 *   past, which is why it is a maintainer sweep in its OWN commit and its own
 *   PR rather than something to bundle into yours.
 *
 *   Both spellings are pinned by tests, because this paragraph has now been
 *   wrong three separate ways — it named a command that silently did nothing,
 *   then one that pnpm could not even parse, then one that refuses to write.
 *   Prose describing a command is a claim about behaviour, and the only thing
 *   that keeps it true is a test that runs it.
 *
 * Neither is licence to raise a budget for growth the PR itself introduced,
 * which is why the regeneration command refuses a raise unless asked twice.
 *
 * What the step breaks on afterwards, by design: any PR adding a TS/TSX/MJS/
 * CJS file over 400 lines, or any PR growing a listed file past its recorded
 * budget. It does NOT break on a file shrinking or disappearing in a PR that
 * never touched the file or its row; those stay advisory notes.
 *
 * THE MERGE-BASE AUDIT (#4388) is one more thing check mode fails on, beside
 * the two teeth and the stale-row check: an allowlist ROW this change wrote
 * that the measurement does not justify. The teeth judge files against rows;
 * neither judged the row, so a resolution that resurrected a deleted row for
 * a 268-line file, kept the row of a file a split took to 348, and carried
 * 766 for a 765-line file printed three notes and OK (#4330). Check mode now
 * diffs the allowlist against `git merge-base origin/main HEAD`: a row added
 * or raised must equal the count `--update` would have written; a lowered
 * row must still name a file over 400 (slack on it is a note: lowering
 * loosens nothing); a kept row fails when this change's own diff took a file
 * over 400 at the base under it, or removed it. The Rust twin's allowlist is
 * audited by the same rules from here. Rows this change did not write and
 * files it did not touch stay advisory (the rationale below, preserved). No
 * base (no `origin/main`, no `main`, --root not a worktree top) fails under
 * CI, skips loudly elsewhere; `--base <ref>` names one by hand.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE: it counts lines, nothing else. A 400-line file
 * doing five jobs passes; a cohesive 900-line table fails. It does not look at
 * plain .js (four hand-written ones under scripts/ at last count — #3672 left
 * them out deliberately), at anything outside packages/, apps/ and scripts/
 * (tools/ holds ~26 more .mjs), at generated, declaration or test files, or at
 * whether a "split" merely moved lines into a sibling file. Freezing a size is
 * not the same as enforcing a design.
 *
 * .mjs/.cjs became part of the population in #3672: this script's own header
 * describes the "extension filter hides a whole tree" defect it was written to
 * close for TypeScript, and it then reported `OK (2084 files measured)` while
 * 208 non-test .mjs files — several over 1,000 lines, this tree's CI gates
 * among them — were invisible to it. Same shape as #3639/#3662
 * (check-source-text-assertions).
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-module-size.mjs
 * Regenerate: pnpm lint:module-size-baseline   (node scripts/check-module-size.mjs --update)
 * Repo-wide sweep, its own PR: node scripts/check-module-size.mjs --update --all --allow-raise
 *
 * An absolute-budget ratchet fights a moving main by construction: any
 * long-lived branch accumulates a red made of files it never touched, and a
 * contributor reading a list of unfamiliar filenames reasonably concludes the
 * gate is noise. `--update` is the supported way to re-record the rows your
 * change touched, so that hand-editing the allowlist stops being the only one —
 * a hand-edited ratchet is one distracted afternoon from someone raising a
 * budget instead of splitting a file, which is the exact thing this gate exists
 * to prevent.
 *
 * `--update` refuses, by itself, to do the one thing that would make it a
 * loophole: it will not raise a budget or add a new exemption. Those need
 * `--allow-raise` on the command line, so the loosening is a deliberate act
 * that shows up in the shell history and in the allowlist's own row diff.
 * `check-unused-locals.mjs --update` has no such safeguard.
 *
 * `--update` NO LONGER MEASURES A FILE IT ALSO WRITES, which is what #3727 and
 * #3693 were about. The digest block lived in THIS file and was one line per
 * scope, so a sweep that added or removed a scope moved this file's length
 * after its own row had been written: the run recorded the pre-rewrite count,
 * reported success and exited 0, and the next plain run measured the real file
 * and failed. `lib/module-size-self-pin.mjs` existed to settle that loop to a
 * fixed point. Removing the pin (#3745, above) removes the loop instead: the
 * only file `--update` writes is the allowlist, a `.txt` that `SOURCE_RE` never
 * matches, so the measurement the run starts from IS the tree it leaves behind
 * and the settle step had nothing left to settle. The self-pin module went with
 * it. If anything here ever becomes self-rewriting again, that fixed point has
 * to come back with it -- `git log scripts/lib/module-size-self-pin.mjs` is
 * where it is.
 *
 * `--update` IS SCOPED to the files your change touched (#3398), derived from
 * `git diff` against the merge base with main plus anything untracked. It used
 * to re-record every row in the tree, which sounds harmless — it only ever
 * TIGHTENED rows it was not asked about — and is not: `slack` and `shrunk` are
 * advisory precisely so a shrink landing on main cannot redden an open PR, so
 * headroom accumulates on main and the next `--update` annexes all of it.
 * Measured on an unmodified checkout of afa717bcf: 11 rows rewritten with a
 * clean `git status`. Two PRs that regenerate in the same window then carry
 * the identical hunks and conflict over changes neither of them made, which
 * is the collision #3398 was filed for. `--all` is the deliberate repo-wide
 * regenerate, and it belongs in its own PR.
 *
 * Flags (development and the test harness only; CI would pass none):
 *   --root <dir>       scan this tree instead of the repo
 *   --allowlist <path> read this allowlist instead of the committed one
 *   --update           re-record the rows your change touched
 *   --allow-raise      with --update, permit budget raises and new exemptions
 *   --all              with --update, re-record EVERY row in the tree, not
 *                      only the changed ones (and skip the git derivation)
 *   --base <ref>       merge base against this ref instead of origin/main
 *                      (then main); for odd clones and the test harness
