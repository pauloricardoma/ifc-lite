/**
 * Reports open PRs whose `pull_request` CI never ran because the PR is
 * conflicted (issue #3443). See scripts/lib/dirty-pr-scan.mjs for the measured
 * evidence and the classification rule; this file is the I/O half.
 *
 * WHY THIS RUNS ON `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` AND NOT `pull_request`: the
 * whole defect is that GitHub does not fire `pull_request` for a PR it cannot
 * compute a merge ref for. A job triggered BY `pull_request` -- including
 * `.github/workflows/pr-review-signal.yml`, built for the adjacent absence
 * defect in #3312 -- inherits exactly the blindness it would need to report on.
 * Only a job on an independent trigger, asking the API which open PRs are
 * conflicted, can see this. See .github/workflows/dirty-pr-scan.yml.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPORTS: the two causes of silent `pull_request` CI, separately,
 * because they take opposite remedies -- a base `test.yml` does not run on
 * (#3429's first case: retarget the PR; a merge cannot help) and an unresolved
 * merge conflict (#3443, #3429's second case: resolve it). See
 * `classifyPr` in scripts/lib/dirty-pr-scan.mjs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DETECT: a single-PR problem (this only runs against the
 * live list of open PRs, on a cron cadence, and has no way to answer "is PR #N
 * clean right now" between runs), a PR that has gone quietly stale (GitHub's
 * own `UNKNOWN` mergeable state is reported but not failed on, since it
 * self-resolves), and a lane ABSENT for a reason this gate cannot name -- a
 * real failure, a path filter, a lane still queued on an otherwise-clean PR --
 * which is deliberately out of scope, since naming a cause it has not
 * established is how a gate starts handing out remedies that do not work. It
 * also cannot detect conflicts closed and reopened between polls; the cron
 * interval IS the detection latency.

 * block, so a cron tick landing next to a push leaves CANCELLED runs behind; a
 * cancelled run never scanned anything, and counting one as "the last run"
 * would report a healthy cadence over a window where nothing was checked.
