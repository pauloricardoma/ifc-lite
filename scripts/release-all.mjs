/**
 * Runs both halves of a release — npm, then crates.io — and reports on both.
 *
 * This exists because the two were chained with `&&`:
 *
 *     pnpm release:npm && pnpm release:crates
 *
 * which makes the Rust half a hostage of the JavaScript half. On 2026-08-12
 * `changeset publish` exited non-zero on ONE package (`@ifc-lite/source-dalux`,
 * never published, so trusted publishing cannot create it — npm 404 on PUT).
 * Every other npm package published fine, and `release:crates` then never ran.
 * crates.io had been stranded at 4.3.0 since 2026-08-03 for that reason, while
 * npm advanced through 4.4.0 to 4.4.1 — nine days in which the Rust fixes those
 * npm changelogs advertised were not reachable from crates.io at all.
 *
 * Neither half is a precondition of the other: they publish to different
 * registries from the same already-built artifacts. So both always run, and
 * the exit code is non-zero if EITHER failed. A failure is never masked — the
 * summary names which half broke, and a half that succeeded is not re-run or
 * rolled back by the other's failure.
 *
 * `scripts/release-crates.mjs` skips versions already on crates.io, and
 * `changeset publish` skips versions already on npm, so re-running after a
 * partial failure is safe and picks up only what is missing.
