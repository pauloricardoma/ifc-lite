/**
 * The comparison under the perf ratchet (#6959): one family's measured values
 * against its committed ceilings. This is the tolerance-aware generalisation
 * of `scripts/lib/count-ratchet.mjs` and keeps its meaning of "went up" and
 * "went down": a value above its allowance is a regression, a value below its
 * ceiling is an improvement. Two things differ, both deliberately:
 *
 *  - a row is never implied. count-ratchet reads an absent key as zero, which
 *    is right for "warnings in this file". Here an absent MEASUREMENT is a
 *    harness fault (`missing`), and a measured id with no committed ceiling is
 *    `unratcheted`; both fail, because "nothing was compared" is not a pass.
 *  - the allowance is `ceiling` widened by the entry's tolerance band.
