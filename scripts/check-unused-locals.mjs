/**
 * A ratchet for unused locals and imports.
 *
 * The repo cannot simply turn on `noUnusedLocals`: there are hundreds of
 * existing violations, and a sweep that large is its own change. But the check
 * was worth having — 12 imports left pointing at code that had moved sailed
 * through a green CI in #2601, because the Lint lane ran no linters at all and
 * `noUnusedLocals` is off (#2603).
 *
 * So this counts violations per package and compares against a committed
 * baseline. A package may never EXCEED its baseline; packages at zero must stay
 * at zero. Fixing violations and lowering the baseline is always welcome, and
 * `--update` rewrites it.
 *
 * The point is that the number can only go down. A package sitting at 355 still
 * catches the 356th — and a package that IMPROVES must lower its baseline in the
 * same change, or the slack it just earned silently absorbs the next 50.
