/**
 * The validator is driven as a PROCESS -- real argv, real file reads, real exit
 * codes, real findings.json -- because that is what the workflow runs. The pure
 * helpers are also imported directly, but only where the process view cannot see
 * the boundary being pinned (range edges, fence shapes, the length cap).
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS FOR EVERY CHECK. A validator that has only been seen to refuse
 * has not been seen to accept, and one that has only been seen to accept has not
 * been seen to work at all. Every fatal class below has a sibling test proving the
 * same fixture passes once the one bad thing is fixed.
 *
 * THE FORGED-MARKER TEST DOES NOT HARDCODE THE PATTERN IT DEFEATS. It extracts
 * MARKER_RE from the shipped text of scripts/check-review-posted.mjs, so the claim
 * under test is "the sanitiser defeats THE GATE", not "the sanitiser defeats a
 * copy of the gate's regex that this file happens to carry". Two copies held
 * together only by prose drift apart silently; this one goes red. It also asserts
 * the UNSANITISED body matches -- a "does not match" assertion is trivially true
 * on a fixture that was never a forgery.
