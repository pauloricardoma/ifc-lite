/**
 * Run the model as a PURE FUNCTION: delimited text in, strict JSON out, nothing
 * else. This is the only file that knows which backend runs.
 *
 * WHY NO TOOLS, NO SHELL, NO MCP, NO REPOSITORY ACCESS. Prompt injection through
 * PR content is not theoretical here: a bash instruction planted in a PR TITLE
 * was executed against Anthropic's own review action (CVSS 9.4), and CodeRabbit
 * had an RCE via a `rubocop.yml` in a pull request that leaked an App key with
 * write access to roughly a million repositories. A reviewer that can execute
 * repository content is an RCE surface. This one cannot: the model has no
 * engine to fire. The worst a malicious diff can do is make it emit a lying
 * finding, which is the failure mode every reviewer already has and which
 * validate-findings.mjs bounds mechanically.
 *
 * WHY NOT `anthropics/claude-code-action`. Its value-add over a bare CLI call is
 * progress tracking and comment posting, and posting is exactly its broken
 * layer: #1679 (open) exits 0 after failing to post every comment, reported as
 * forty consecutive runs logging `Posted 0/N`. We keep its auth mechanism -- the
 * same `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, the same subscription -- and own the posting.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MUST NEVER DO, and it is the reason it exists as a separate
 * step: EMIT A CLEAN VERDICT IT DID NOT EARN. The review gate one layer up
 * cannot tell "the model had nothing to say" from "the model was throttled into
 * saying nothing but something still posted" (that gate's stated hole 3). So the
 * distinction has to be made HERE, while the exit code and stderr still exist:
 *
 *   - ANY non-zero exit, or `is_error: true`, or an unparseable envelope, is a
 *     job failure. Full stop. There is no "degrade to clean" path in this file.
 *     An unknown error shape therefore still fails loudly; classification below
 *     only improves the label a human reads.
 *   - A drained subscription pool surfaces as an error, not as a short answer.
 *     `QUOTA_DRAINED` is a distinct class because its remedy is distinct: do NOT
 *     re-run, the pool refills on a clock and a retry spends nothing but time.
 *
 * THE HOLE THAT REMAINS, STATED: a throttle that manifests as a syntactically
 * valid but degraded answer is invisible to this file. No API reports it. The
 * backstop is downstream and mechanical -- validate-findings.mjs requires
 * `files_reviewed` to name every file we sent and requires verbatim quotes from
 * the patches, so a model that did not actually read the diff cannot pass. A
 * model that read it and reviewed it badly is not caught by anything here; that
 * is the precision instrument's job, not this one's.
 *
 * FAILURE CLASSES:
 *
 *   QUOTA_DRAINED    Usage limit hit. REMEDY: do not re-run until the pool
 *                    resets. A retry burns time and changes nothing.
 *   AUTH_FAILED      Token missing, expired or rejected. REMEDY: refresh
 *                    CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN with `claude setup-token`.
 *   MODEL_ERROR      Any other non-zero exit or `is_error`. REMEDY: read the
 *                    captured stderr, which is printed verbatim.
 *   CLI_SILENT_EXIT  Non-zero with no diagnostic stderr. The live session-limit
 *                    shape may still leave an opaque JSON envelope on stdout.
 *   EMPTY_RESPONSE   The CLI succeeded and produced nothing. Treated as failure
 *                    rather than as an empty review.
 *   BAD_ENVELOPE     The CLI's own JSON wrapper did not parse.
 *
 * STATED HOLES:
 *
 *   1. The classifier matches on message TEXT, which is a third party's wording
 *      and can change. The catch-all is what makes that safe: an unrecognised
 *      error is MODEL_ERROR and still fails. Only the label degrades, never the
 *      verdict.
 *   2. The exact wording of an OAuth quota exhaustion in headless mode is
 *      UNVERIFIED. It is captured the first time it happens and the pattern list
 *      updated then. Guessing a pattern now and calling it measured would be the
 *      kind of claim this repository's gates exist to catch.
