/**
 * The `validate-findings.mjs` REASONS the workflow retries once:
 * all are transient model-output shapes a second, differently-steered attempt
 * can fix without loosening any underlying check. Everything else
 * (SCHEMA_INVALID, VERDICT_CONTRADICTS_FINDINGS, ...) reflects the prompt,
 * input, or harness and gets no retry. `claude-review.yml`'s bash greps
 * `validate-findings.mjs`'s `❌ ${reason}:` console lines rather than importing
 * this (a validator failure never reaches an export at runtime). That leaves
 * the list written down TWICE, so both copies are pinned, in different
 * places: `validate-findings.test.mjs` pins the CONTENTS of this Set
 * exactly, and `run-reviewer.test.mjs` pins the workflow's grep
 * alternation against it. The second did not exist until a reason was
 * added here and nothing failed: a reason in the Set but not in the grep
 * is a retry that can never fire.

/**
 * THE RETRY BLOCK (#3652, generalized by #3777 and #3775). Sibling-extracted
 * out of `run-reviewer.mjs`, which is pinned at zero headroom in
 * `scripts/module-size-allowlist.txt`.
 *
 * Present only on a second attempt, after `claude-review.yml`'s "Validate the
 * findings" step failed for one of the five reasons it retries. `reason`
 * picks which prose runs -- the failure shapes are unrelated and telling the
 * model the wrong one would be a lie: a truncated response never touched
 * `riskiest_change.quoted_line`, a bad quote is not a token-budget problem,
 * and an all-dropped response was neither truncated nor about a bad quote.
 *
 * PROOF_OF_WORK_FAILED (#3652, unchanged). `checkProofOfWork` rejected the
 * previous `riskiest_change.quoted_line`. This does not ask for a DIFFERENT
 * kind of answer -- `files_reviewed` and `riskiest_change` keep the exact
 * contract they always had -- it tells the model, concretely, which nomination
 * failed and why, so it can pick a real line it can reproduce verbatim instead
 * of retrying the one it just could not. `files_reviewed` already matched last
 * time (this reason only fires on a quote failure, never on the files-reviewed
 * proof, which is the harder anti-#1644 signal and stays fatal with no retry),
 * so the model has already demonstrated it read the diff; this just steers a
 * second, achievable choice of evidence.
 *
 * The check itself (`quoteAppearsIn` / `checkProofOfWork`) is UNCHANGED by
 * this: still verbatim, still an eight-character floor. Widening it was
 * measured wrong three times (#3652/#3690 history) because a short or
 * truncated quote is guessable, not just uncommon. This gives the model a
 * second, honest chance at the SAME check instead.
 *
 * RESPONSE_TRUNCATED (#3777). The terminal sentinel was missing: the response
 * ended before the model meant it to, most likely because the output token
 * budget ran out mid-answer. Nothing about `riskiest_change` failed -- there is
 * no quote to fix -- so this asks for the SAME review again, not a different
 * choice of evidence, and names the actual cause so the model can budget its
 * own answer more tightly (fewer, more decisive findings; the terminal field
 * written last, not appended after more prose than the budget allows).
 *
 * VALIDATION_EMPTY (#3775). `verdict: "findings"` and every individual
 * finding was dropped -- each drop is its own `DROPPED findings[i]: ...`
 * warning naming why (a file outside the review set, an off-by-one line
 * citation, a body that sanitised to nothing), and all of them are fenced
 * below verbatim. This is not a verdict about the code; it is the model
 * producing a bad response this time, the same shape as RESPONSE_TRUNCATED.
 * The retry asks it to look again at each named problem and either fix it or
 * genuinely report clean -- it is never told to keep a finding the validator
 * would still drop for the same reason.
 *
 * CLASS_PASS_INCOMPLETE (#3831). The verdict was `clean` and the per-class
 * pass was missing, incomplete, or twelve copies of one sentence. This is a
 * response-shape failure like the two above, not a verdict about the code: the
 * model may well be right that the diff is clean, and the retry says so
 * explicitly so it is never steered into inventing a finding to escape the
 * check. What it must not do again is claim `clean` without showing the walk.
 *
 * FINDINGS_INVALID (#3919). The response omitted `findings` or emitted a value
 * that was not an array. A clean verdict still requires `"findings": []`; this
 * is a retryable model-output shape, not permission for the validator to infer
 * an empty review. A second malformed response still fails unchanged.
 *
 * @param {string} retryNote the prior validator failure's text
 * @param {(body: string) => string} fenceUntrusted
 *   Injected rather than imported, so this stays a leaf: `retryNote` traces
 *   back to the model's own previous quote, which is drawn from PR-controlled
 *   diff bytes, so it must be fenced exactly like the diff -- never appended
 *   as trusted text.
 * @param {string} [reason] which validator failure this retries. Defaults to
 *   `PROOF_OF_WORK_FAILED` for backward compatibility with #3652 callers that
 *   never passed one.
 * @returns {string[]} lines to splice into the prompt; empty when there is no retry
