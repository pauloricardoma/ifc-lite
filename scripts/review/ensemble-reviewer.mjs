/**
 * A PARALLEL CHEAP ENSEMBLE, not a stronger failover chain.
 *
 * `openrouter-reviewer.mjs`'s chain tries one model, then the next, only on
 * failure -- it spends one model's worth of tokens per PR and reaches for a
 * second only when the first is down. At ~950 reviews/week that one-model-at-
 * a-time chain is cheap, but it is also one opinion: a single cheap model
 * missing a defect class is not caught by a chain that never asks a second
 * model the same question.
 *
 * This module asks several CHEAP models the SAME prompt, concurrently, and
 * pools their findings before the existing mechanical validator and judge ever
 * see them. Strong models (Sonnet, `openai/gpt-6-sol`) stay reserved for the
 * failover path in run-reviewer.mjs, which only fires when this ensemble is
 * disabled, unconfigured, or fails outright.
 *
 * Actual billed usage.cost is preferred; static token pricing is an explicitly
 * labelled fallback when the provider omits it. Calls and pool-validation
 * outcomes are retained in a sidecar even when the ensemble falls through.
 *
 * POOLING IS AT THE FINDINGS LEVEL, not by concatenating raw text. Each
 * model's JSON is parsed independently and its `findings` array is tagged with
 * `source: <model>` before merging, so a duplicate defect flagged by two models
 * survives as two findings for the judge to deduplicate (see judge.md and
 * run-judge.mjs's prompt change) rather than being silently dropped here. The
 * MERGED result is re-serialised as ONE combined raw-review JSON, because the
 * pipeline downstream of run-reviewer.mjs (validate-findings.mjs, the retry
 * step, the judge) all expect a single raw-text envelope; this is the "combined
 * raw text whose sections the validator accepts" shape called for when
 * per-model validation cannot travel independently through that pipeline.
 *
 * CLEAN IS UNANIMOUS. The pooled verdict is `clean` only when every model that
 * produced a parseable answer said `clean`; ANY successful model reporting
 * findings makes the pooled verdict `findings`, because a miss by the majority
 * is still a real defect if even one cheap model caught it.
