/**
 * WHICH INLINE COMMENTS SIT ON A REVIEW THREAD SOMEONE HAS RESOLVED (#3768).
 *
 * REST's `pulls/{n}/comments` exposes no resolution state at all, and its
 * `commit_id` is a pointer GitHub RELOCATES onto whatever the head currently is
 * (#3729). Put together, a PR that once received any finding could never again
 * carry a `verdict=clean` marker: every prior finding kept reporting the current
 * head, resolving its thread changed nothing a REST reader could see, and the
 * only way out was DELETING the comments -- which destroys the audit trail.
 * Resolution lives in GraphQL `reviewThreads.isResolved` and nowhere else, so
 * this module is the one GraphQL call in the lane.
 *
 * WHO IS TRUSTED BY THIS, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. Resolving a review thread
 * on GitHub needs write access to the repository -- and a pull request AUTHOR has
 * it on their own PR. So "this thread is resolved" means "someone who can merge
 * chose to withdraw this finding", not "someone independent agreed it was wrong".
 * A PR author can therefore clear the lane's own findings off their head.
 *
 * That is DELIBERATE, and it is not a new grant. Before #3768 the only way to
 * stop a finding contradicting a clean run was to DELETE the inline comment,
 * which needs the same write access and additionally destroys the audit trail.
 * This moves the same authority onto an action that leaves the finding, the
 * thread and the timestamp visible to a reviewer. The trust level is unchanged;
 * what changed is that exercising it stops erasing the evidence.
 *
 * What this must NOT be read as: a resolved thread is not a second opinion, and
 * nothing downstream should treat `verdict=clean` over resolved threads as
 * stronger than it is. The marker records the count; who resolved what is in the
 * thread history, where a human can see it.
 *
 * IT FAILS CLOSED, AND THE DIRECTION MATTERS. A thread this cannot account for
 * -- the page cap was hit, a shape changed, `gh` failed -- is simply ABSENT from
 * the returned set, so its comments count as UNRESOLVED and keep blocking a
 * clean verdict. There is no path where a failed read makes a PR look cleaner
 * than it is; a failed read makes it look exactly as blocked as before this
 * module existed. Every such shortfall is also reported in `warnings`, because
 * an unread page silently reading as "nothing there" is the defect one layer
 * below where this lane usually catches it.
 *
 * IT NEVER THROWS. The caller is deciding between `clean` and `findings` on a
 * run that already succeeded; a GraphQL hiccup must not turn that into a red
 * job, and it does not have to, because the fail-closed direction already gives
 * the safe answer.
 *
 * THE CLIENT IS INJECTABLE, unlike the rest of post-review.mjs, whose docblock
 * states outright that it has no test seam. That is not a reversal: the seam is
 * here, in a module that is a pure function of what GraphQL returns, and
 * post-review.mjs still calls it with the real `gh` and is still driven as a
 * process by a fake `gh` on PATH. The pagination and shape handling is what
 * wants unit tests; the ordering of network calls is what wants the process.
