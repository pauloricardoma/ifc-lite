/**
 * THE DEFECT CLASSES, AND THE PER-CLASS PASS A CLEAN VERDICT HAS TO SHOW (#3831).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `rubric.md` has listed these classes since the lane shipped,
 * and listing them changed nothing measurable: three live evaluations scored
 * 1-3/15 recall over 18 real pull requests, with 13-14 of them returning `clean`
 * and zero findings, and Opus scored the same 2/15 -- so the gap is not model
 * capacity. What the rubric never did was make `clean` CONDITIONAL on walking
 * the list. A model that spots one obvious duplicate-site defect and stops
 * produced output byte-indistinguishable from one that walked all twelve classes
 * and genuinely found nothing, and the harness had no way to tell them apart.
 *
 * So `clean` now costs a per-class verdict with a stated reason, and this module
 * is the ONE place the class list lives. `rubric.md` prints the ids to the model
 * and `finding-schema.mjs` checks the answer against the same array, so the
 * prompt and the validator cannot ask for and enforce different lists. The guard
 * that holds them together is in `../validate-findings.test.mjs` ("the rubric
 * names EVERY class the validator enforces"), which is where it has to live:
 * `.github/workflows/test.yml` globs `scripts/review/*.test.mjs` and NOT
 * `scripts/review/lib/`, so a test file next to this one would never run in CI.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not decide whether a finding is real, and it never
 * turns `clean` into `findings`: a reviewer that walks all twelve and reports
 * every one clear still gets a clean verdict posted. It refuses only the answer
 * that skipped the walk, which is the one the eval measured 13-14 times out of
 * 18.
 *
 * BOUND TO THE DIFF, NOT TO THE PROSE. The first cut of this check was lexical
 * -- twelve rows, twelve distinct sentences -- and a lexical bar is cleared for
 * free: `why: "no such code in diff (7)"` twelve times over, or
 * `why: "<class> does not apply"` per class, are twelve distinct sentences and
 * not one reason. So `not-applicable` is now allowed only for a class
 * ./class-applicability.mjs says this diff cannot carry, and a class it CAN
 * carry must be `clear` with a `path:line` from the diff in its reason, checked
 * against the added ranges by the same `lineIsAdded` every finding is anchored
 * with.

/**
 * Every class `rubric.md` names under "What to look for", plus

 * the same reason the rest do: the rubric tells the model to report one as a
 * finding, and a reviewer that never looked at the fenced text is exactly the
 * reviewer that reports it never saw one.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE RUBRIC'S ORDER, so a reader comparing the two files reads the
 * same sequence. The check below is order-insensitive; this is for humans.

/**
 * REFUSE A CLEAN VERDICT THAT DID NOT SHOW ITS PER-CLASS PASS.
 *
 * Called only on `verdict === "clean"`. A `findings` verdict is exempt on
 * purpose: it already carries evidence that the model engaged with the diff, and
 * requiring twelve more paragraphs beside it would spend the output budget that
 * `RESPONSE_TRUNCATED` already fires on.
 *
 * THE APPLICABILITY BINDING IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF, and the distinctness rule
 * below is not. Requiring twelve rows with twelve different sentences is cleared
 * for free -- `"no such code in diff (0)".."(11)"`, or `"<class> does not
 * apply"` per class, are twelve distinct sentences and not one reason -- so the
 * verdict is checked against the DIFF instead:
 *
 *   - a class ./class-applicability.mjs says this diff CAN carry may not be
 *     `not-applicable`;
 *   - a class the predicates cannot see is free: `not-applicable` needs only a
 *     reason, because the harness has nothing to contradict it with.
 *
 * ONLY THE WAVE-OFF IS FATAL. `clear` is accepted with or without a cited line,
 * and a citation that does not resolve is an annotation rather than a refusal --
 * both measured on the red lanes recorded in `checkClassPass` below.
 *
 * The predicates under-fire on purpose (see that file), so this is a floor under
 * `not-applicable`, never a claim that the classes it does not name are absent.
 * The remaining gap is printed by the eval as CLASS SKIPPED rather than assumed
 * away.
