/**
 * A CASE WHOSE DEFECT CLASS THE REVIEWER DECLARED INAPPLICABLE IS STILL A MISS,
 * AND SAYS SO (#3831).
 *
 * The recall number alone cannot separate the two ways a known defect goes
 * unreported: the reviewer walked its class and did not see it, or the reviewer
 * wrote `not-applicable` against that class and never looked. Those need
 * opposite fixes -- the first is a rubric or model problem, the second is the
 * pass being waved through -- and before this they printed the same `MISSED`
 * line. Three live evaluations were read as the former when 13-14 of 18 cases
 * had produced no per-class pass at all.
 *
 * It is reported, never scored against separately: a skip is a miss, counted
 * once as a miss, and the count below exists so a human can see WHICH kind of
 * miss the recall number is made of. Nothing here can turn a miss into a hit.
 *
 * THE MATCHER IS A PARAMETER. `matches` above is the offline stem rule; the
 * semantic matcher in ./semantic-match.mjs resolves its answers up front and
 * hands in a lookup with the same `(expected, findings, body)` contract plus a
 * position, so this function stays synchronous and every branch below is still
 * drivable without a model call. Default unchanged: every existing caller and
 * test scores exactly as before.
 *
 * @param {(expected: object, findings: object[], body: string|null, ctx: { caseIndex: number, expectedIndex: number }) => { hit: boolean, by: string|null }} [opts.matcher]
