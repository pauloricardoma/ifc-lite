/**
 * THE SEMANTIC EVAL MATCHER: "does this finding describe the expected defect?"
 * answered as a calibrated probability, one question per same-file finding,
 * one request per expected defect.
 *
 * WHY THE STEM MATCHER WAS NOT ENOUGH. `matches` in ./eval-score.mjs credits a
 * finding on the right path that shares two word stems with the description.
 * Replayed over the 18 eval cases and 78 candidate pairs (bench, 2026-09-21):
 * the stem rule credited 29 pairs of which 6 described the defect; this
 * matcher at 0.5 credited 7 of which 6 did, and missed none of the 6. The 23
 * false credits were "might break existing behavior", "the check is correct",
 * and wrong-sibling second-site guesses -- exactly the hits that made a
 * rubric look better than it was. The two functions coexist: the stem matcher
 * is the offline fallback and is still what the unit tests exercise without a
 * network; this one is authoritative whenever the key is present.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT SENT. Nothing but the expected description and the findings'
 * own text: no diff, no PR body. The body exclusion that eval-score.mjs
 * argues for at length is moot here because the question is "same defect",
 * not "shares vocabulary" -- the failure mode it guards against (crediting a
 * reviewer for paraphrasing the body) is a false credit this matcher
 * measured 0 of.
