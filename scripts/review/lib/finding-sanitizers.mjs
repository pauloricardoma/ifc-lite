/**
 * THE SECURITY BOUNDARY. Everything the model controls that can reach a posted
 * comment body goes through here.
 *
 * Order is deliberate and each step depends on the one before it:
 *
 *   1. Whole HTML comments are REMOVED. They can carry a forged marker, and they
 *      are invisible in the rendered comment, so anything hiding in one is hiding
 *      on purpose.
 *   2. Any remaining `<!--` -- an unclosed comment -- is broken, because it would
 *      otherwise swallow the real marker the poster appends after this body.
 *   3. The literal token `ifc-lite-review` is broken EVERYWHERE, not only inside
 *      comments.
 *
 *      WHAT WAS ACTUALLY MEASURED, because the obvious claim here is wrong.
 *      Mutation-testing this file showed that against the gate's CURRENT
 *      MARKER_RE, steps 1 and 2 are already sufficient on their own: that pattern
 *      requires a literal `<!--`, and after those two steps no `<!--` survives in
 *      the output at all. So the three steps are mutually redundant there, and it
 *      would be false to call this one "the" defence.
 *
 *      It earns its place on the two cases the others do not cover. First, the
 *      token appears in ORDINARY TEXT that is not in a comment -- this lane's own
 *      source carries it (MARKER_RE in check-review-posted.mjs, and this file), so
 *      a model reviewing that diff quotes it and a reviewer writing about it types
 *      it. Second, it is the only step that still holds if the gate's pattern is
 *      ever loosened to match the token outside an HTML comment, which is a change
 *      a future editor could make in check-review-posted.mjs without ever reading
 *      this file.
 *   4. `@` before a word character gets a zero-width space, so a body cannot
 *      summon a person or a team into a thread. (An email address in a body picks
 *      up the same treatment. That is a cosmetic cost on a rare input, taken
 *      knowingly rather than adding a cleverer pattern with a hole in it.)
 *   5. The length cap runs LAST, so the final string is genuinely within the cap:
 *      steps 1-4 change the length in both directions, and capping before them
 *      would let defanging push the result back over. Truncation can only DELETE
 *      trailing text, so it cannot construct a marker out of what remains.

 * TRUNCATION cannot collapse two paths the way the 60-char slice made
 * `property-table.tsx` and `property-header.tsx` collapse into one.
 *
 * That is the whole guarantee, and it is narrower than "distinct paths always
 * render distinctly". DEFANGING is lossy and runs BEFORE the digest, so paths
 * differing only in what defanging removes still collide -- measured, all legal
 * git paths: `dir/a<!--x-->b.ts` vs `dir/ab.ts`; two spaces vs one; a tab vs a
 * space; a leading space vs none; and `ifc-lite-review.ts` vs its U+2011
 * non-breaking-hyphen lookalike -- IN ANY CASE now, not only in lowercase. The
 * replacement used to be a fixed lowercase string, which spared the uppercase
 * pair by rewriting its case; that was a worse bug than the collision it
 * avoided, so `defangToken` preserves the match and the pair collides like every
 * other. Sub-cap paths get no digest at all, so nothing disambiguates them. A
 * reader can therefore still see `omitted=2` above two identical-looking
 * entries.
 *
 * Accepted rather than fixed: defanging is load-bearing (it is what stops a
 * path forging a marker) and it must stay lossy to do that job. The cost is
 * cosmetic -- a duplicate-looking line in an advisory list.
 *
 * Digesting the RAW path instead would in fact disambiguate these, and safely:
 * a sha256 hex digest is `[0-9a-f]` only, so it cannot reproduce `<!--`, the
 * marker token or an @-mention. An earlier version of this comment claimed
 * otherwise and was simply wrong. The real cost is that it would hang a digest
 * suffix on EVERY row to disambiguate a case nobody has hit, which is a poor
 * trade for an advisory list.
