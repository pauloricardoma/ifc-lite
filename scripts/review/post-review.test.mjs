/**
 * The poster is driven as a PROCESS -- real argv, real config reads, real exit
 * codes, real `spawnSync('gh', ...)` -- because that is what CI runs.
 *
 * THE SEAM IS A FAKE `gh` ON PATH, NOT A FLAG IN THE SCRIPT. post-review.mjs
 * carries no `--gh-state`, no injected transport and no `if (TEST)` branch, so
 * the bytes under test are the shipped bytes, ORDERING INCLUDED -- and ordering
 * is the entire thing this file exists to pin. A seam inside the script would
 * have been a second implementation of the one behaviour that matters.
 *
 * The fake records an ORDERED CALL LOG, which is how the order is asserted
 * rather than described: a test that only checks the final comments cannot tell
 * "marker after read-back" from "marker before read-back", and that difference
 * IS the bug (claude-code-action#1679).
 *
 * The last defence against drift is that this file runs the REAL gate,
 * ../check-review-posted.mjs, over exactly what the poster posted. The poster's
 * read-back predicate and the gate's FINDINGS_NOT_POSTED predicate are
 * deliberate duplicates; prose cannot keep two copies in step, so they are
 * checked by execution instead.
 *
 * Both directions for every verdict. A poster that has only been seen to post
 * has not been seen to refuse.
