/**
 * A MODEL'S OUTPUT IS AN UNTRUSTED STRING, AND EVERY BYTE OF IT ARRIVES ON THE
 * PULL REQUEST UNDER AN IDENTITY THE REVIEW GATE ALREADY TRUSTS.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/check-review-posted.mjs` proves a review REACHED the
 * pull request. It says so itself, in its own stated holes: it "proves nothing
 * about whether the review was any GOOD", and "a reviewer that posts a marker and
 * an empty body satisfies this gate". This file is the other half. It stands
 * between the model and the poster, and it refuses to hand the poster anything it
 * has not checked against the diff we actually sent.
 *
 * THE THREE FAILURES IT IS BUILT AGAINST, all with evidence:
 *
 *   1. THE QUIET QUIT. anthropics/claude-code-action#1644 (bug, p1, 2026-08-13):
 *      the agent "exits success after 5-10 turns without completing the review
 *      (silent no-op)", roughly half of runs, with `is_error: false`. A model that
 *      stopped after two files can still emit a confident `verdict: "clean"`. The
 *      only thing it CANNOT do is quote lines it never read, which is why
 *      PROOF_OF_WORK_FAILED exists and why it is fatal rather than advisory.
 *
 *   2. THE CONFIDENT INVENTION. A finding naming a file we never sent, or a line
 *      the diff never touched, posts an inline comment on someone else's code. It
 *      is not a review, it is noise with our name on it, and once it is posted the
 *      review gate counts it as a finding. Per-finding validation drops these.
 *
 *   3. THE LAUNDERED MARKER, and this is the one that is a SECURITY hole rather
 *      than a quality one. Our poster posts these bodies through the default
 *      GITHUB_TOKEN, so they appear as `github-actions` -- a login listed in
 *      `expectedAuthors` in scripts/review-posted.config.json. The gate's
 *      MARKER_RE scans comment bodies on the `reviewComments` surface among
 *      others. So a finding body containing a well-formed
 *
 *          <!-- ifc-lite-review sha=<40-hex> verdict=clean count=0 -->
 *
 *      would be posted BY US, FROM A TRUSTED AUTHOR, ON THE RIGHT SURFACE, and
 *      would satisfy the gate. That is a forged review laundered through our own
 *      identity, and the input that carries it is a diff -- which any contributor
 *      can write, and which the model will faithfully quote back. `sanitize` is
 *      therefore load-bearing, not hygiene. It breaks the literal token in every
 *      model-controlled string that reaches a comment body, INCLUDING `quote`,
 *      because the most realistic delivery is a source line a contributor added
 *      on purpose for the model to quote verbatim.
 *
 * That third one is the repository's own recorded lesson twice over: absence must
 * not read as success, and a trusted channel is the one worth attacking. The cost
 * of getting it wrong is already measured here -- 174 of 830 merged PRs in August
 * 2026 (21%, 46,717 lines) carried no review while showing green, and #3175 then
 * corrected TWELVE changesets by hand that would have shipped breaking changes as
 * `patch`, with the release one command from publishing.
 *
 * PURE AND OFFLINE, on purpose. Three paths in, one file out, no network and no
 * `gh`. A step that decides whether a review is postable must not be able to fail
 * because a registry or an API was slow, and it must be drivable end to end by a
 * harness with no token and no pull request.
 *
 * FAILURE CLASSES, each with its OWN remedy, because a remedy that contradicts its
 * finding is worse than no remedy:
 *
 *   BAD_ARGS        Unrecognised flag, or a flag with no value.
 *                   REMEDY: fix the workflow step's invocation.
 *   NO_RAW/NO_INPUT/NO_OUT  A required path was not passed. Not defaulted: a
 *                   guessed path would validate a file nobody chose.
 *                   REMEDY: pass all three.
 *   RAW_UNREADABLE / INPUT_UNREADABLE  The file is missing or unreadable. An
 *                   ABSENT raw file is the #1644 shape at its most extreme -- the
 *                   model wrote nothing at all -- so it must never be read as an
 *                   empty clean review. REMEDY: read the review step's log; it ran
 *                   and produced no output.
 *   RAW_EMPTY       The raw file exists and is blank. Same shape, said separately
 *                   because the remedy differs: the step ran, so look at
 *                   `num_turns` in its log rather than at whether it ran.
 *   INPUT_INVALID   The review-input JSON we ourselves built is malformed, has no
 *                   files, or names one file twice. Fails closed: with no files to
 *                   check against, every check below passes vacuously, which is
 *                   the "scan of nothing reported as a clean scan" defect (#3194).
 *                   REMEDY: fix the step that BUILDS review-input.json.
 *   RAW_UNPARSEABLE The model's text is not JSON (one leading/trailing ```json
 *                   fence is stripped; nothing else is repaired -- see the holes).
 *                   REMEDY: tighten the prompt's output instruction. Do NOT add a
 *                   repair pass here; a repairer that guesses is a second model
 *                   with no proof of work of its own.
 *   RESPONSE_TRUNCATED  Valid JSON with no terminal sentinel. This is the check
 *                   that catches a response which stopped early yet still parses:
 *                   `{"verdict":"clean"}` is complete JSON and a complete lie.
 *                   REMEDY: raise the output token budget, or send fewer files.
 *   SCHEMA_INVALID  A required top-level field is missing or wrongly typed.
 *                   REMEDY: fix the prompt. (An individual BAD FINDING is dropped,
 *                   not fatal -- see below.)
 *   FINDINGS_INVALID `findings` is missing or is not an array. This one top-level
 *                   shape is retried once with a focused correction; it is never
 *                   defaulted, so a second malformed response still fails.
 *   VERDICT_CONTRADICTS_FINDINGS  `verdict: "clean"` with a non-empty findings
 *                   array. Self-contradictory, and both ways of resolving it are
 *                   wrong: trusting the verdict drops real findings, trusting the
 *                   findings posts them under a marker that says clean.
 *                   REMEDY: re-run. Never guess which half was meant.
 *   PROOF_OF_WORK_FAILED  `files_reviewed` is not exactly the set we sent, or the
 *                   riskiest-change quote is not in that file's patch. The
 *                   anti-#1644 check. REMEDY: re-run; if it recurs, the review
 *                   step's log will show a low `num_turns`.
 *   VALIDATION_EMPTY  `verdict: "findings"` and NOTHING survived validation. Not
 *                   silently downgraded to clean, which would be a lie, and not
 *                   passed through as zero findings, which would leave the marker
 *                   claiming findings that do not exist.
 *                   REMEDY: read the dropped-finding warnings printed above it.
 *   OUT_UNWRITABLE  findings.json could not be written. Fatal: a poster reading a
 *                   missing or stale file is the absence-reads-as-success shape.
 *
 * ON EVERY FATAL PATH THE OUTPUT FILE IS REMOVED. A previous run's findings.json
 * sitting next to a failed validation is a stale artefact that a poster cannot
 * tell from a fresh one, and it would post last commit's findings under this
 * commit's marker.
 *
 * STATED HOLES, so nobody reads a zero exit as more than it is:
 *
 *   1. It proves the model READ the diff and that each surviving finding is
 *      ANCHORED to it. It proves nothing about whether the findings are CORRECT.
 *      A model can quote a real line and say something false about it. Precision
 *      is a separate instrument and this is not it.
 *   2. CLOSED (#3658). `line` and `quote` used to be checked INDEPENDENTLY: the
 *      quote had to appear somewhere in the file's patch, and the line had to
 *      fall in one of that file's added ranges, but nothing compared the two --
 *      so a finding quoting one added line and anchored at a different added
 *      line passed and posted on the wrong line. `addedLinesMatching` below now
 *      requires the quote to be the TEXT of the added line AT `f.line`,
 *      trimmed the way `newFileLines` trims a context line. A mismatch is
 *      DROPPED, not corrected to the line the quote actually sits on: a comment
 *      moved to a line the model never named is a second guess this file has no
 *      basis for, and a dropped finding is loud (a DROPPED warning naming both
 *      the claimed line and, when found, the line the quote actually matches)
 *      where a silently-relocated one would not be.
 *   3. A response with prose BEFORE the fence, or two fenced blocks, is
 *      RAW_UNPARSEABLE rather than repaired. That is the intended direction: a
 *      repair pass is where a validator starts inventing the thing it validates.
 *   4. Sanitisation makes `quote` verbatim-modulo-defanging. Anything downstream
 *      that wants to re-verify verbatimness must do it against the raw model
 *      output, not against findings.json. Validation here deliberately runs BEFORE
 *      sanitisation for exactly that reason.
 *   5. The cap keeps the FIRST `MAX_FINDINGS` findings in the model's own order,
 *      which is not a severity order: arbitrary ones, not the worst ones. Stated
 *      without a numeral because it said "five" for a while after the cap became
 *      twelve, and this list exists to say what gets silently discarded.
 *   6. It cannot tell "the model had nothing to say" from "the model was throttled
 *      into saying nothing but still emitted valid JSON". PROOF_OF_WORK_FAILED
 *      catches the throttled case only when it also stopped quoting.
