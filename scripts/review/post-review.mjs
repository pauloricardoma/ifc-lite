/**
 * THE MARKER IS WRITTEN LAST, AND THAT ORDER IS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THIS FILE.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `anthropics/claude-code-action` #1679 is OPEN (bug, p2,
 * 2026-08-16): "post-buffered-inline-comments exits 0 after failing to post
 * every comment", reported as FORTY CONSECUTIVE RUNS logging `Posted 0/N` while
 * the job went green. The review ran. The findings existed. Zero comments
 * reached the pull request. Nothing in the exit code, and nothing in a
 * `--json-schema` result, can tell that run apart from a successful one: the
 * schema describes what the model PRODUCED, not what the pull request RECEIVED.
 *
 * This repository has already paid for the same defect from the other side: 174
 * of 830 merged PRs in August 2026 (21%, 46,717 lines) carried no review of any
 * kind while showing green, and #3175 then had to correct TWELVE changesets by
 * hand that would have shipped breaking changes as `patch`, with the release one
 * command from publishing. ABSENCE MUST NOT READ AS SUCCESS.
 *
 * `scripts/check-review-posted.mjs` is the gate that adjudicates the marker this
 * script writes. THIS IS THE ONLY WRITER OF THAT MARKER, and it is built so the
 * #1679 shape cannot survive it: the marker is written ONLY after the inline
 * comments have been READ BACK FROM THE PULL REQUEST. A comment we sent is not
 * evidence; a comment GitHub hands back on a subsequent GET is.
 *
 * THE ORDER, and it is not negotiable:
 *
 *   1. RE-READ THE HEAD. If the PR has moved past `--sha`, exit 0 as
 *      SKIPPED_STALE and post NOTHING. The newer event's run owns the new head.
 *      Posting for a dead head would leave a marker the gate then calls
 *      STALE_REVIEW -- a red that no re-run of THIS commit can clear.
 *   2. POST each finding to `pulls/{n}/comments` with `commit_id`, `side=RIGHT`,
 *      `line`, `path`, `body`, checking every response for a comment id. Any
 *      failure aborts with exit 1 and NO marker. Findings already present on
 *      this head (fingerprinted) are SKIPPED, so a crash-and-rerun does not
 *      double-post.
 *   3. READ BACK. `GET pulls/{n}/comments`, count comments from our identity
 *      whose `original_commit_id` is exactly this head -- NOT `commit_id`,
 *      which GitHub relocates onto a later head (#3729). This is the gate's own
 *      FINDINGS_NOT_POSTED predicate, and now literally the same FUNCTION
 *      (`wroteAtCommit`) rather than the same spelling, so the two cannot
 *      drift. Still checked by EXECUTION, not by prose: post-review.test.mjs
 *      feeds what this script actually posted into the real gate as a process
 *      and asserts REVIEW_POSTED.
 *   4. ONLY THEN write one issue comment carrying the marker, whose `count` is
 *      the number CONFIRMED in step 3 -- never the number the model claimed.
 *      That is the whole difference between a marker and a receipt.
 *   5. READ THE MARKER BACK once. A marker we could not read is a marker the
 *      gate may not be able to read either.
 *
 * A failure at ANY step leaves the pull request marker-less, so the gate reads
 * NOT_POSTED (its remedy: re-run the review job) and the re-run is safe.
 *
 * THE OTHER HALF OF THE CONTRACT: THE REVIEWER MUST POST ON EVERY RUN, INCLUDING
 * A CLEAN ONE. A reviewer that stays silent when it finds nothing makes
 * "reviewed and found nothing" byte-identical to "never ran", which is exactly
 * the trap CodeRabbit falls into here. So an empty run still posts a marker, and
 * silence therefore means failure.
 *
 * WHICH empty-run marker is `markerVerdict`'s decision (#3862): `verdict=clean`
 * only when a per-class pass stood behind the reviewer's own `clean`, and
 * `verdict=clean-by-judge` for a `findings` verdict the judge emptied -- covered
 * by the gate, never `llm-reviewed`.
 *
 * FAILURE CLASSES, each with its OWN remedy, because a remedy that contradicts
 * its finding is worse than no remedy:
 *
 *   SKIPPED_STALE       Not a failure. The head moved while we worked; exit 0,
 *                       nothing posted. REMEDY: none. The run triggered by the
 *                       new head owns it.
 *   AUTHOR_NOT_EXPECTED `--author` is not in the gate's `expectedAuthors`. We
 *                       would post a marker the gate ignores -- a green poster
 *                       over a red gate. Refused BEFORE anything is posted.
 *                       REMEDY: add the login to review-posted.config.json (on
 *                       the BASE branch, which is the copy the gate reads), or
 *                       fix `--author`.
 *   NO_FINDINGS_FILE /  The findings file is missing, unparseable, or not one of
 *   BAD_FINDINGS /      the two accepted shapes, or a row lacks a usable
 *   BAD_FINDING         path/line/body. NEVER read as "clean": an unreadable
 *                       findings file is the absence-reads-as-success defect one
 *                       layer below where this gate usually catches it.
 *                       REMEDY: fix the reviewer's findings writer.
 *   HEAD_UNREADABLE     The PR object came back without a 40-hex head sha.
 *                       REMEDY: check the token's `pull-requests` scope; do not
 *                       proceed on a guessed head.
 *   INLINE_POST_FAILED  A `pulls/{n}/comments` POST threw, or returned 2xx with
 *                       no comment id. THIS IS #1679 CAUGHT AT THE SOURCE.
 *                       REMEDY: re-run. A 422 here usually means `line` is not
 *                       in this commit's diff; fix the finding's anchor.
 *   READBACK_SHORT      Fewer findings are visible on the PR than the findings
 *                       file holds. THIS IS #1679 CAUGHT AT THE READ-BACK: every
 *                       POST reported success and the comments are not there.
 *                       REMEDY: re-run. If it recurs, attach the log to
 *                       claude-code-action#1679 rather than re-running forever.
 *   (CLEAN_CONTRADICTED  REMOVED. It threw when this run found nothing while our
 *                       own findings stood on the same head, and its remedy was
 *                       "re-run" -- which reproduced the state exactly, so the
 *                       lane failed forever until a human deleted a comment.
 *                       Measured on #3669: three consecutive runs, no path out.
 *                       The standing findings now simply STAND: the marker says
 *                       `findings` with the confirmed count and the summary
 *                       states the disagreement. Withdrawal is still possible
 *                       and still needs a human, but it is no longer the ONLY
 *                       way out of a red lane.)
 *   SUMMARY_POST_FAILED The marker comment POST/PATCH returned no id.
 *                       REMEDY: check that the posting workflow has write access
 *                       to the pull request, then re-run.
 *   MARKER_NOT_READ_BACK The marker is not readable on the PR one GET after it
 *                       was written. REMEDY: re-run. The gate reads NOT_POSTED
 *                       until it is, which is the correct direction to fail.
 *   COMMENTS_TRUNCATED  A comment surface still had pages after the bounded
 *                       walk, so a finding may be on a page never read. Refuses
 *                       rather than guessing. REMEDY: raise the pager's budget,
 *                       or narrow what the reviewer posts.
 *   BAD_ARGS / NO_PR / NO_REPO / NO_SHA  Broken invocation. REMEDY per message;
 *                       all fail closed, none post.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO TEST SEAM IN THIS FILE. There is no `--gh-state`, no injected
 * transport, no `if (process.env.TEST)`. The harness puts a fake `gh` on PATH,
 * so the code CI runs and the code the tests run are the same bytes, ordering
 * included. A seam here would be a second implementation of the one thing this
 * file exists to get right, and it would be the copy nobody exercises.
 *
 * STATED HOLES, so nobody reads a green here as more than it is:
 *
 *   1. It proves the findings REACHED the pull request. It proves nothing about
 *      whether they were any good, or whether the model read the whole diff.
 *      Precision and recall are separate instruments.
 *   2. `--author` is a CLAIM about who we post as. It is verified on a findings
 *      run (the read-back filters on it, so a wrong login yields zero and fails
 *      READBACK_SHORT) and again on the marker read-back. On a CLEAN run with a
 *      wrong login the marker posts before the read-back refuses it: exit 1 with
 *      a marker present is possible only on that one path, and the gate then
 *      reads NOT_POSTED, which is still the safe direction.
 *   3. The dedupe fingerprint uses `path`, `line` and the body, NUL-separated so
 *      no path or body can forge a boundary. GitHub returns
 *      `line: null` for a comment that has gone outdated, so such a comment does
 *      not match and the finding is posted again. A duplicate comment is noise;
 *      a missing one would be a lie, so the fingerprint fails towards noise on
 *      purpose.
 *   4. `--author` is checked against the config path it was GIVEN. The gate reads
 *      the config from the BASE branch. Point `--config` at that same base copy
 *      or the agreement between poster and gate is only as good as the two files
 *      happening to match.
 *   5. Between the read-back and the marker write, a comment could be deleted.
 *      The window is one HTTP call wide and nothing here closes it.
 *   6. THE FALSE-POSITIVE FOOTER IS OMITTED ON A CLEAN RUN. "React with a thumbs
 *      down on a finding" printed where there are no findings is the same class
 *      of lie as a green tick over an unreviewed diff -- the sibling gate's own
 *      harness pins exactly that rule for its advisory notice. A deliberate
 *      deviation from the brief, stated rather than silently applied.
