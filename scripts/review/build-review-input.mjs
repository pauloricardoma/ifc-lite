/**
 * Assemble exactly what the reviewer is allowed to see, and record what it was
 * NOT shown.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN STEP. The reviewer runs as a pure function: delimited text
 * in, strict JSON out, no tools, no shell, no repository access. That is the
 * whole injection defence (a bash instruction planted in a PR was executed
 * against Anthropic's own review action, CVSS 9.4; CodeRabbit had an RCE via a
 * `rubocop.yml` in a PR). A model with no engine cannot be made to fire one. The
 * cost of that choice is that the prompt is the entire world the reviewer has,
 * so building it is a step with its own rules rather than a line in a workflow.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO INCLUDE:
 *
 *   - THE PR TITLE. Attacker-controlled free text, and the exact field the
 *     CVSS 9.4 exploit used. The diff has to be included because it is the
 *     subject; the title does not, so it is not.
 *
 *     THE BODY IS NOW INCLUDED, deliberately, and this paragraph used to say it
 *     was refused. It is passed with `--body-file`, capped, fenced with a nonce,
 *     and labelled in the prompt as a claim to check rather than an instruction
 *     -- because "the description says X, the diff does Y" is a defect class the
 *     rubric now names, and one that is invisible without it. The title is still
 *     refused: it carries no such claim and buys nothing.
 *
 *     A safety comment that was true when written and quietly became false is
 *     the thing that gets a later reader to skip the guard it describes.
 *   - GENERATED AND VENDORED FILES. Measured on this repo, excluding them moves
 *     the mean diff by about 5%, so this is not a cost lever -- it is an
 *     attention lever. A lockfile in the prompt is 40k tokens of noise competing
 *     with the code under review.
 *
 * `unreviewable` carries {path, reason} OBJECTS rather than annotated strings.
 * That is not cosmetic: validate-findings.mjs refuses an input where a path
 * appears in BOTH `files` and `unreviewable`, and against annotated strings that
 * check can never match, so it would be an inert guard that reads as a live one.
 *
 * WHAT IT RECORDS RATHER THAN DROPS. GitHub omits `patch` on very large files.
 * Those files are listed by name in `unreviewable` instead of being silently
 * absent, because a reviewer that was never shown a file must not be able to
 * report it clean, and a downstream reader must be able to see the difference.
 * That is the same absence-reads-as-success rule the review gate enforces one
 * layer up.
 *
 * `addedLineRanges` is the load-bearing output. It is parsed from the hunk
 * headers and is what makes a finding's anchor CHECKABLE: validate-findings.mjs
 * refuses any finding whose line falls outside an added range, which is how a
 * hallucinated line number gets caught before it reaches the PR.
 *
 * FAILURE CLASSES:
 *
 *   NO_FILES          The PR has no reviewable files. Exits non-zero: a review
 *                     of nothing is not a clean review, and the caller must
 *                     decide, not this script.
 *                     REMEDY: nothing to do; the lane should skip this PR.
 *   REVIEW_TOO_LARGE  Total patch text over MAX_PATCH_BYTES.
 *                     REMEDY: split the PR. Below the cap the lane DEGRADES
 *                     instead (see the omission note above `fitFilesToPrompt`):
 *                     it reviews the largest files that fit the prompt and
 *                     records the rest as unreviewable, so a near-cap PR gets a
 *                     partial review with a marker instead of a MODEL_ERROR red
 *                     that no re-run can clear (#3679).
 *   NOTHING_FITS      Nothing at all fits the model prompt: one file's patch is
 *                     bigger than the whole prompt, or the paths alone fill it.
 *                     A SKIP, not a failure, and that is the distinction from
 *                     REVIEW_TOO_LARGE: no re-run can clear it, so failing the
 *                     job here would leave a red that only splitting the PR
 *                     removes while the gate tells you to re-run. The lane
 *                     posts `nothing-to-review` instead, which leaves the head
 *                     covered for dedup and NOT full, so CodeRabbit still reads
 *                     the PR. Same handling as NO_FILES, same reason.
 *   GH_*              Propagated from lib/gh.mjs. All fail closed.
 *
 * STATED HOLES:
 *
 *   1. The reviewer sees a DIFF, not the repository. It cannot know that a
 *      symbol removed here is used elsewhere. The rubric forbids claims that
 *      depend on unseen files for exactly this reason, and the deterministic
 *      gates own the cross-file questions.
 *   2. The exclude list is a fixed list, not a `.gitattributes` read. A newly
 *      generated artifact is included until someone adds it here.
 *   3. Renames and deletions carry no `patch` for the old path, so a defect
 *      whose evidence is what USED to be there is invisible to this reviewer.

 * Walk a patch and classify every line, numbering it AS IT WILL BE IN THE NEW FILE.

 * This is the single counter. `addedLineRanges` is built on it, and so is the

 * because a second hand-rolled counter is how an off-by-one gets certified: it
 * agrees with this one on the easy patch it was written against and diverges on
 * a hunk that does not start at line 1, on a second hunk, and on a file with no
 * trailing newline.
 *
 * Match a quote against `text` for `added` lines only, and TRIM BOTH SIDES.
 * That GATE is strictly stricter than `quotableLines` in validate-findings:
 * every NON-EMPTY quote it accepts, `quotableLines` accepts too, and not the
 * reverse. The exception is the one rule `quotableLines` has that the gate does
 * not -- it drops what trims to empty -- so a blank added line gives a quote the
 * gate accepts and the validator refuses.
 *
 * The two FUNCTIONS still differ, which matters the moment you read `text` for
 * any other kind. `quotableLines` works on the RAW diff line: it discards
 * anything beginning `@@`, `+++ `, `--- ` or `\`, strips one leading `+`, `-`
 * or space from what is left, trims, and drops what is then empty.
 * `newFileLines` classifies the line first and strips only a space from a
 * context line. Measured on this commit:
 *
 *   raw          newFileLines   quotableLines
 *   "---x"       "---x"         "--x"       strip rules differ
 *   "--- x"      "--- x"        dropped     read as a file header
 *   "+++i;"      "+++i;"        "++i;"      strip rules differ
 *   "+++ i;"     "+++ i;"       dropped     read as a file header

 *
 * A deleted `-- drop old table` becomes the raw line `--- drop old table`, and
 * `quotableLines` refuses it outright -- worth knowing before reusing it to
 * match anything that is not an added line.

/**
 * Which candidate files fit the model prompt, and which must be dropped.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (#3679). MAX_PATCH_BYTES (600 KB) is larger than the prompt
 * the model actually accepts: source code meters at ~1.95 bytes per token, so a
 * near-cap diff alone is ~300k input tokens. PR #3668's own review passed at a
 * 421,355-byte prompt and failed MODEL_ERROR at 580,241 bytes -- and
 * run-reviewer has NO path from MODEL_ERROR to a marker, so the job went red
 * with nothing posted and nothing any re-run could clear. Refusing instead
 * (lowering the cap) is the same trade already made and reverted once here.
 * So the lane DEGRADES: it reviews the largest files that fit and RECORDS the
 * rest, and the recorded rows travel all the way to the posted marker.
 *
 * LARGEST FIRST, because the largest files carry the most changed lines: for a
 * fixed byte budget that ordering maximises how much of the diff is actually
 * read. Greedy, so a file too big for the remaining room does not block a
 * smaller one behind it. Ties break on path so two runs of one head agree.
 *
 * THE CHARGE IS MEASURED, PER ROLE, AND EACH CANDIDATE PAYS THE ROLE IT ENDS
 * UP IN. A candidate is either KEPT (a `--- FILE:` header plus a roster row --
 * its path spent TWICE) or OMITTED (one unreviewable row -- its path once, plus
 * the reason). Which costs more depends on the path's length against the
 * reason's, so neither role dominates. A hand-written constant stood here and
 * drifted: it charged every row at the unreviewable rate, which undercharges a
 * kept file once its path outgrows the reason, and 600 candidates with 188-byte
 * paths were declared to fit 8,476 bytes over MAX_PROMPT_BYTES -- measured
 * through buildInput -> buildPack -> buildPrompt with the shipped rubric.
 *
 * ITS REPLACEMENT CHARGED max(kept, omitted) TO EVERY CANDIDATE UP FRONT, which
 * is safe by bytes and wrong by outcome: a role a file does not end up in is
 * still billed for. On a wide PR that is the dominant term. Measured on this
 * branch: 2,000 files whose patches total 26 KB -- nothing close to any limit --
 * drove the budget negative and threw REVIEW_TOO_LARGE saying "no single file's
 * patch fits the model prompt", which was false about all 2,000 of them.
 *
 * SO THE FIT IS A FIXED POINT, reached in one pass rather than iterated. Start
 * from "every candidate omitted" and admit files largest-first; admitting one
 * SWAPS its omitted row for its kept rows, so it costs its patch bytes plus
 * `keptRowCharge - unreviewableRowCharge` -- a swing that is positive for a long
 * path and NEGATIVE for a short one. The swings are additive, so the running
 * total is exact for whatever set comes out; there is no second pass to do.
 *
 * Rows unreviewable for OTHER reasons never move, so they pay exactly their own
 * rendering. The pack needs no reservation: packBudgetFor already yields to the
 * diff and reaches zero exactly on the PRs this function bites on.
 *
 * THE BUDGET IS SHORT BY THE UNREVIEWABLE SECTION'S PREAMBLE (128 bytes) AND
 * `promptEnvelopeBytes`'s `countDigits` terms (a handful). Latent, and named
 * rather than left to be discovered: both are absorbed by the margin inside
 * PROMPT_BASE_OVERHEAD_BYTES, which is 24,000 against a measured envelope well
 * under it. Deriving the budget from `promptEnvelopeBytes` directly would close
 * the gap, but that function charges a SETTLED input and this one is choosing
 * what the input will be -- it would have to be re-evaluated per candidate, so
 * it is a real change rather than a substitution.
