/**
 * Score a rubric against defects that were REALLY missed.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The lane's rubric buys precision with recall on purpose, and
 * measured on live traffic it returned `clean` on six pull requests carrying
 * ELEVEN real findings -- including a Major defect that reopened a hole, and one
 * where the lane's own author had mis-described his design. Changing the rubric
 * to recover that recall is obviously tempting and completely unmeasurable by
 * argument: a prose edit either finds more real defects or invents more noise,
 * and reading the prose cannot tell you which.
 *
 * So this replays diffs whose answer is already known -- CodeRabbit found these,
 * the lane did not -- and reports two numbers a rubric change has to move in the
 * right direction together:
 *
 *   RECALL    of the known findings, how many did this rubric surface?
 *   EXTRA     findings it produced that are NOT in the ground truth.
 *
 * EXTRA IS NOT "FALSE POSITIVES", and calling it that would be the mistake this
 * file has to avoid. CodeRabbit's findings are a floor, not a census: a finding
 * the lane makes that CodeRabbit missed may be perfectly real. So EXTRA is
 * reported as a number to LOOK AT, never as a score to minimise, and the harness
 * prints each one so a human decides. A harness that auto-penalised extras would
 * train the rubric toward silence, which is the failure it exists to fix.
 *
 * IT COSTS SUBSCRIPTION QUOTA. Each case is one model call, so this is
 * `workflow_dispatch` and local, never per-PR. Run it before and after a rubric
 * change, on the same cases, and compare.
 *
 * STATED HOLE: two cases and three known findings is a small sample, and a
 * rubric that improves on these may not improve in general. It is enough to
 * catch a change that makes recall WORSE, which is the direction that matters
 * when the current recall is zero.

 * Which side a non-zero validator exit blames.

 * The REVIEWER's fault: it answered with malformed JSON, said nothing, ran out
 * of tokens, contradicted itself, skipped the proof of work, or quoted lines
 * that are not in the diff so every finding was dropped. The lane POSTS nothing
 * in each of those cases, so the honest score is zero findings for that PR.
 * Aborting instead throws away every other case and reports a broken
 * instrument -- the exact confusion between absence and failure that this
 * pipeline exists to keep apart, and the first version of this split made it
 * for four of the seven, including the two most likely on a real corpus.
 *
 * The INSTRUMENT's fault: the harness fed the validator something wrong, or
 * could not write its output. RAW_UNREADABLE and RAW_EMPTY sit here even though
 * their remedies talk about the model, and for the same reason:
 * `run-reviewer.mjs` throws EMPTY_RESPONSE and exits non-zero before it writes,
 * so the case is already refused as "did not run" upstream. If the validator
 * ever does see a missing or blank raw file, the plumbing broke rather than the
 * model, and aborting is the conservative direction anyway. Putting RAW_EMPTY
 * on the reviewer side contradicted that reasoning while sitting four lines
 * from it. Nothing about the rubric can be read off such a
 * run, so it stops.
 *
 * A reason in NEITHER set stops the run too. Both sets are written out here --
 * the classification is this harness's policy, not the validator's -- and they
 * are held to `REASONS`, which validate-findings.mjs exports, by a test that
 * requires every reason to be classified exactly once. So a reason added there
 * cannot be silently scored as "the reviewer found nothing".
