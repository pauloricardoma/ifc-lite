Expose shared native Room planning and atomic command operations to SDK hosts. Await asynchronous SDK channel results before structured cloning, and share the viewer's native layout cache and Undo history. Room Update rejects malformed wire ID lists, including sparse arrays, before model resolution or native preparation. Responses that cannot be structured-cloned now return the canonical error envelope instead of leaving channel requests to time out.
