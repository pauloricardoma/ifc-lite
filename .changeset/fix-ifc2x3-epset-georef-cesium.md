Fix IFC2X3 `ePset_MapConversion` / `ePset_ProjectedCRS` georeferencing so the authored EPSG code is read (not a fallback `EPSG:4326`), and route those models into the Cesium / federation pipeline.

IFC2X3 has no native `IfcMapConversion`/`IfcProjectedCRS`, so tools like `ifc-georeferencer` store georeferencing in property sets per the buildingSMART guide. Three bugs dropped these models to the legacy `IfcSite` lat/long (`EPSG:4326`), so two files differing only by CRS (`EPSG:7415` RD+NAP vs `EPSG:28992` RD) both displayed the same wrong CRS:

- The pset-name match was case-sensitive (`ePSet_`/`EPset_`) and missed the real-world `ePset_` casing — now matched case-insensitively in both the TS (`extractGeoreferencing`) and Rust (`GeoRefExtractor`) extractors.
- The ePSet path never read `ePset_ProjectedCRS.Name` (nor `MapConversion.TargetCRS`), so the EPSG code was discarded — now surfaced, with typed `IFCLABEL(...)`/`IFCLENGTHMEASURE(...)` values unwrapped.
- The viewer's on-demand extractor never loaded the property sets at all — now pulls in the georef ePSets + their values (only when no `IfcMapConversion` exists, deferred-atom safe).

The viewer's Cesium/federation gate accepts the `ePSetMapConversion` source, and ePSet offsets are scaled by the project length unit (millimetres for these files) so the model reprojects to the correct location instead of ~1000× out of range. The offline reproject fallback for the compound `EPSG:7415` (datum reported as `RD`) now carries the Kadaster `+towgs84` shift.
