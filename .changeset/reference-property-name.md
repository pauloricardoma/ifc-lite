An `IfcPropertyReferenceValue` now reads as the `Name` of the object it references (a material, person, document, classification reference, …). If the object has no `Name`, it reads as its `Identification`, and failing that as `#<id>`. The parser used to take the `UsageName` slot for the reference, so every reference property read as empty. That was a bug, and rules and the property panel now see the referenced name. It also applies to references nested inside a complex property. IDS property checks on a reference property now compare against that name as well. The server's data model (`apps/server`) had the same slot bug and now reads references the same way, and so does the Rust mutation-log STEP writer's property base.
