/// Replay the chunks in file order into one index, and count the refusals

/// ## Why a refusal needs attributing at all
///
/// A refusal is a record the scanner dropped, so it leaves no trace in
/// `records` and the stitch cannot re-derive it. A chunk `i > 0` starts at
/// an arbitrary byte and can begin inside a quoted value, where a string
/// literal shaped like `#4294967297=IFCWALL(` reads as a record and gets
/// refused. Those refusals belong to the speculative prefix this stitch
/// throws away, so summing the chunks would report refusals on a file that
/// declares none.
///
/// ## The rule, and why it is exact
///
/// Chunk `i`'s retained region begins at `target` — chunk `i-1`'s
/// validated handoff, a REAL entity start — and chunk 0's begins at the
/// header skip. Scanner events advance `position` monotonically, so every
/// event a chunk emitted before the record at `target` sits strictly below
/// `target`; and from that record on, the chunk's `position` sequence is
/// the serial scanner's (the handoff is a real start and `find_entity_end`
/// re-parses the record from its `#`). Hence:
///
///   * refusals `>= target` are exactly the post-resynchronisation ones,
///     and they are the ones a serial scan over those bytes also produces;
///   * refusals `< target` are exactly the speculative-prefix ones, and
///     they are dropped with the records they sat among.
///
/// A chunk stops at the first record at/after its `range_end`, which is
/// the next chunk's `target`, so the intervals `[target_i, target_{i+1})`
/// tile the file with no gap and no overlap: each real refusal is counted
/// once, by exactly one chunk. On the `Err` fallback the chunk is
/// discarded whole, refusals included, and the serial rescan over the same
/// bytes supplies them instead.
///
/// What this does NOT bound: a `#<digits>=` inside a quoted value that the
/// SERIAL scanner also mis-parses (only reachable on malformed input,
/// where a stray quote has already flipped `find_entity_end`'s parity)
/// still counts here, because it counts there. That is parity with the
/// serial path, which is the target — not immunity to mis-parsing, which
/// would mean giving the scanner quote context (#3395/#3430).
///
/// ## The malformed-record report is a REPORT, never a control signal
///
/// A malformed record comes in two shapes and only one of them stops the
/// scan (see `close_step_record` in ifc_lite_core's parser::lexical).
/// `malformed_start` is set for BOTH, so it cannot say which happened, and
/// this stitch used to read it as if it always meant the permanent one,
/// dropping every chunk after it. Once a missing `;` became recoverable that
/// turned one lost record into the whole tail of the file.
///
/// `handoff` is the signal that actually distinguishes them, and it always
/// did: a chunk whose scanner stopped runs out of records before
/// `range_end` and hands back `None`, which the `expected_start: None`
/// break below already drops every later chunk on. So byte-identity with
/// the serial scan is carried by the handoff alone, and `malformed_start`
/// is only ever accumulated into the returned bool, which callers report
/// once, stitched, never per shard.
///
/// "Attributed" carries the same speculative-prefix caveat as a refusal —
/// `chunk.malformed_starts` filtered by `>= target` is that, mirroring the `<
/// target` split `refusals.partition_point` already makes.
