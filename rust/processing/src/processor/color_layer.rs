/// a long ACYCLIC chain: every insert succeeds, the guard never fires, and the
/// stack still overflows. A Rust stack overflow is SIGABRT, not a catchable
/// panic, so nothing upstream turns it into a load error and in the wasm
/// geometry worker it takes the instance down. Reproduced on 6.9 MB of
/// well-formed IFC: 60 000 nested mapped items, every id distinct.
///
/// AGENTS.md asks for this shape over a depth cap, and the reason applies
/// exactly here: with no call stack to consume there is nothing left for a cap
/// to protect, and the visited set becomes sufficient on its own. A cap would
/// also have to answer "what is a legitimate nesting depth", and answering it
/// wrong loses a layer silently on a file no exporter would call malformed.
/// `appearance::evaluated_source::validate_style_tree` walks a comparable
/// graph the same way.
///
/// Work is bounded without a budget: each representation is expanded at most
/// once, and items are pushed only from a representation being expanded for
/// the first time, so the total is at most the number of item references in
/// the file.
///
/// Traversal order is the document order the recursive version had, and it is
/// load-bearing because the first match wins: a file may assign layers at more
/// than one depth. Items are pushed in reverse so the first pops first, and
/// pushing a mapped item's target representation on top descends into it
/// before the next sibling item is examined.
