/// already no-ops on positions/normals/origin. So only an ACTUALLY rotating
/// site placement invalidates the captured transforms — `site_local_rotation`
/// being `Some` is not enough on its own, since it is `Some` for every
/// `site_local`-tier model (translation-only included).
///
/// This no longer gates INSTANCING metadata (#4118 part B). That consumer got a
/// way to express the same staleness as a frame rather than lose the data:
/// [`native_to_baked`] hands the collator the basis the bake happened in, and
/// the collator conjugates both its reconstruction check and its emitted
/// relative transform by it. The local-bounds/local-to-world consumers (the
/// zero-copy mesh getters and the demesher) have no such basis argument, so

/// What it encodes:
///
/// * the router subtracts the model RTC offset while baking, so every tier
///   carries `T(-origin_shift)`;
/// * `site_local` ALSO runs [`convert_mesh_to_site_local`], which applies the
///   site placement's inverse rotation `Rᵀ` to positions, normals and the f64
///   origin — and in that tier the RTC offset IS the site translation (the
///   three-tier selection in `processor::mod` takes it straight off the site
///   matrix), so a baked point is exactly `Rᵀ · (P − t_site)`;
/// * `model_rtc` and `raw_ifc` remove no rotation, so they are
///   `T(-origin_shift)` alone. `raw_ifc` selects `origin_shift = (0,0,0)`,
///   which makes that the identity that tier is documented to be. The
///   translation is still applied unconditionally, so a caller handing in a
///   non-zero shift under some other tier string gets the frame its vertices
///   are actually in rather than a silent identity.
///
/// `Rᵀ` is applied under exactly [`rotation_is_identity`]'s condition, because
/// that is the condition [`apply_inverse_rotation_in_place`] itself no-ops
/// under: the two must agree, or this basis describes a bake that did not
/// happen.
