//! The one place the symbolic stream converts IFC world coordinates into the
//! frame the viewer draws in.
//!
//! The mesh pipeline stores `world = origin + position + rtc_offset` in IFC
//! Z-up metres (`crate::simplify_session`), so a re-based vertex is the IFC
//! coordinate minus the RTC offset on ALL THREE axes — and, in the site-local
//! tier, turned by the site placement's inverse rotation as well
//! (`processor::site_local`, #4706). Both halves come off the one
//! [`MeshFrame`] the caller's meshes were baked in. The viewer reads that
//! Y-up: `renderX = ifcX - rtc.x`, `renderZ = -(ifcY - rtc.y)`,
//! `renderY = ifcZ - rtc.z` (`apps/viewer/src/lib/wall-rects-from-meshes.ts`).
//! Symbolic primitives are overlaid on that scene, so they must be re-based
//! by exactly the same offset. `rust/wasm-bindings/src/api/grid_lines.rs`'s
//! `to_render_frame` is the same conversion written out for the 3D grid
//! overlay, and agrees axis for axis.
//!
//! This type exists because the offset used to travel as two loose `f32`
//! arguments (`rtc_x`, `rtc_z`) through six modules: the plan Y flip was
//! handed the offset's Z (elevation) component instead of its Y, putting the
//! whole overlay a northing away from the meshes, and the elevation was never
//! re-based at all. With the components private and reachable only through
//! [`RenderFrameRebase::plan`] / [`RenderFrameRebase::elevation`], a call
//! site can no longer pick the wrong one.
