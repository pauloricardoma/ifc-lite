//! Parallel entity-index construction.
//!
//! [`build_entity_index_parallel`] returns a **byte-identical**
//! [`EntityIndex`](ifc_lite_core::EntityIndex) to the serial
//! [`ifc_lite_core::build_entity_index`], but scans the STEP DATA section on all
//! cores. The STEP scan (entity offsets) is otherwise 100% single-threaded and
//! is a large fraction of load on big models.
//!
//! ## Why byte-identical is achievable despite splitting mid-record
//!
//! The serial builder walks `EntityScanner::next_entity()` from the header-skip
//! to EOF and does `index.insert(id, (start, end))` per entity, so the contract
//! we must reproduce is: **the same key set, the same spans, and last-wins on a
//! duplicate id in file order.**
//!
//! We split the file into N byte ranges and scan them concurrently. Only chunk 0
//! starts at a known-good boundary (`EntityScanner::new`, header-aware); every
//! other chunk starts at an arbitrary byte via `EntityScanner::new_at`, which may
//! land inside a quoted string or a `/* … */` comment. A speculative scan from
//! there can emit garbage "records" until it re-synchronises to the real STEP
//! record grid (STEP is self-synchronising: after the next real `;` terminator
//! the misaligned scanner produces exactly the records an aligned scanner would).
//!
//! The **handoff-stitch** makes this exact, not heuristic:
//!   * Each chunk `i` scans until the first entity whose `start >= range_end_i`,
//!     recording that offset as its `handoff` (the first real entity the *next*
//!     chunk owns), and keeps every earlier record.
//!   * A serial O(N) stitch replays the chunks in order. Chunk 0 is authoritative.
//!     For chunk `i>0` the previous chunk's validated handoff is a **real** entity
//!     start; we binary-search chunk `i`'s records for it. Records before it are
//!     speculative false-starts and are dropped; from it onward the scan is
//!     provably aligned (a record can only begin exactly at that offset if the
//!     `#`-hunt landed on the real `#`, and `find_entity_end` re-parses the record
//!     from its `#`, so the span is computed identically).
//!   * If the handoff is **not** present (the speculative scan overshot it, or a
//!     single record spans the whole chunk), we fall back to a serial rescan of
//!     that one range from the known-real handoff — identical output to the serial
//!     builder for those bytes. This never triggers on real files; it is the
//!     correctness net that keeps the merge byte-identical on adversarial input.
//!
//! Concatenating the validated slices in chunk order reproduces the serial
//! file-order entity stream with no gap and no overlap, so inserting them in that
//! order preserves last-wins exactly.
//!
//! ## Targets
//!
//! Native only. On wasm32 rayon runs inline (no worker threads are wired), so a
//! parallel driver buys nothing and only adds merge overhead — the wasm build
//! delegates straight to the serial scanner and is unchanged.

/// makes that exact, not heuristic). Returns every record with
/// `start < range_end` (strictly increasing in `start`), the `handoff` (the
/// `start` of the first record at/after `range_end`, i.e. the next shard's
/// first real entity, or `None` at EOF), the refusal offsets, and the
/// malformed-record stop offset (see below).
///
/// **It does not report either diagnostic, and it must not.** A shard with
/// `range_start > 0` starts at an arbitrary byte, so it can begin inside a
/// quoted value; a string literal containing `#4294967297=IFCWALL(` satisfies
/// the scanner's `#<digits>[ws]*=` shape check (which has no quote context),
/// so the speculative prefix can refuse arbitrarily many records that the file
/// never declared. Reporting from inside the shard therefore turns a file with
/// NOTHING oversized in it into a "skipped N records" warning — a false alarm
/// on valid input, which is worse than the inflated count the first version of
/// this was thought to produce (#3395, retracted reasoning on #3430).
///
/// Bounding by ownership alone (`start < range_end`) does not fix it either:
/// a false refusal parsed out of a quoted value INSIDE the owned range still
/// counts. Only the stitch knows which bytes of a shard were kept, so only the
/// stitch can attribute a refusal — see [`native::stitch`].
///
/// The malformed-record offsets are the `line_start` of every record
/// [`ifc_lite_core::EntityScanner::find_entity_end`] refused. Most are
/// RECOVERABLE: a record missing its `;` is dropped and the scan carries on
/// (#4179), so `records`/`handoff` above continue past it. Only a record with
/// nothing to resume from stops the scan, and that shows in `handoff` being
/// `None` before `range_end`. All of them, not just the first: a shard can
/// hold a speculative drop inside a quoted value AND a real one after it, and
/// [`native::stitch`] must be able to find the real one. Same
