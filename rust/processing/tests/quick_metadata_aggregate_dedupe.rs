//! Split out of #4590. An `IfcRelAggregates` naming a spatial child k times per
//! level, or under a second parent, must still put each node in the bootstrap
//! tree exactly once (it came out k^depth times), and a back-edge listed before
//! the real parent (the #4246 shape) must not cut the branch off the project.
//! Every edge left out of the tree is reported on the bootstrap with its parent
//! and child ids and its kind (#4662).
