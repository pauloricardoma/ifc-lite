//! #4118: a `site_local`-tier model whose `IfcSite` placement is a pure
//! translation (no rotation) must NOT discard instancing metadata — the
//! guard in `element.rs` used to key off `site_local_rotation.is_some()`,
//! which is true for every `site_local` model regardless of whether its site
//! placement actually rotates anything, so a translated-but-unrotated site
//! (the common case for a model imported with a georeferenced offset) lost
//! instancing for no reason.
//!
//! Two `IfcBuildingElementProxy` occurrences share one `IfcRepresentationMap`
//! via `IfcMappedItem`, placed under a translated (non-rotated) `IfcSite`.
//! With `enable_instancing` armed, the pipeline's #1623 don't-bake plan should
//! materialize ONE template mesh carrying `MeshData.instance` and leave the
//! second occurrence as a non-template ref that collates against it — proving
//! instancing metadata survived the site-local tier.
