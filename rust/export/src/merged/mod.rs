//! **Merged** multi-model STEP exporter. A native (Rust) port of
//! `packages/export/src/merged-exporter.ts`: combine several IFC files into one
//! by offsetting each later model's express ids and rewriting every
//! `#`-reference, while unifying the shared spatial/infrastructure tree so the
//! result is one coherent model rather than N stacked copies.
//!
//! Feature parity with the JS `MergedExporter` (issue #2951):
//! - **Project / infrastructure unification** — later models' `IfcProject` and
//!   the first `IfcUnitAssignment` / representation contexts are dropped and
//!   their references redirected to the first model's (compatible models only).
//! - **Spatial unification** — `IfcSite` / `IfcBuilding` / `IfcBuildingStorey`
//!   are matched onto the first model's by name / elevation ([`spatial`]).
//! - **GlobalId reconciliation** — a rooted entity that duplicates a prior
//!   GlobalId in the same unit space is unified (refs remapped to the first
//!   instance); otherwise it is re-stamped with a deterministic fresh GlobalId
//!   ([`guid`]), so a federated file never carries duplicate GlobalIds.
//! - **Visibility filtering** — a per-model `included` allowlist is honored via
//!   the forward-reference closure ([`plan::resolve_included`]).
//!
//! Genuine cross-unit rescaling (`unitReconciliation: 'normalize'`) is deferred:
//! a model whose length unit is incompatible with the first is **federated**
//! (kept as its own project, never mis-scaled) and [`MergedStats::unit_rescale_required`]
//! is set so the caller can gate that case to the JS path.
