//! The STEP exporter's public vocabulary: what a caller asks for
//! ([`StepOptions`] and the three mutation kinds) and what it gets told
//! afterwards ([`StepStats`]).
//!
//! Split out of `step.rs` for the module-size ratchet
//! (`rust/processing/tests/module_size_ratchet.rs`), the same way the text
//! primitives went to `step_text.rs` and the copy-on-write pass to
//! `step_cow.rs`. `step.rs` was 399 lines against a 400-line limit, so the next
//! change to it had to move something out, and these five declaration-only
//! types were the coherent thing to move: no behaviour, no dependency on the
//! export loop, and one theme between them.
//!
//! No CALLER can see the split, and the header does not claim otherwise:
//! `step.rs` re-exports all five (so `crate::step::StepOptions` and every other
//! existing path still resolves) and `lib.rs` already exported them from the
//! crate root. The benefit is to the ratchet and to whoever next reads
//! `step.rs`, not to the interface.
