//! **COLLADA 1.4.1** (`.dae`) exporter — the model format Google Earth's KML
//! `<Model>` actually loads (it does NOT accept glTF/GLB; a `.glb` in `<Model>`
//! fails with "Unsupported element: Model"). Used to build the KMZ payload (#1427).
//!
//! Input is the viewer's already-produced **Y-up** `MeshData` (the from-meshes
//! path), identical to the GLB exporter. Two Google-Earth-specific choices make
//! the model render correctly:
//!
//! - **Orientation:** vertices are converted back to the IFC-native **Z-up** frame
//!   (`(x, y, z)_yup -> (x, -z, y)_zup`) and the document declares `<up_axis>Z_UP</up_axis>`,
//!   so the building stands upright. Horizontal grid-north alignment is carried by
//!   the KML `<Model><Orientation><heading>` (computed elsewhere), exactly as the
//!   GLB path did, so X/Y placement matches the (already-correct) GLB output.
//! - **Brightness:** Google Earth has no ambient/IBL and a single hard sun, so a
//!   plain diffuse material renders near-black. Each material sets `<emission>` to
//!   its colour (the well-known "make Google Earth models glow" trick) so the model
//!   shows its true colour. Faces are flagged `double_sided` via the `GOOGLEEARTH`
//!   profile extra (IFC winding isn't reliably outward).
