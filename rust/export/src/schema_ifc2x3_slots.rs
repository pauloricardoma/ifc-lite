//! Slots IFC2X3 requires a value in, on a downgrade to IFC2X3 (#4714).
//!
//! IFC4 made attributes optional that IFC2X3 declares mandatory, so a valid
//! IFC4 record legitimately carries `$` where the IFC2X3 target requires a
//! value. Two policies settle those slots, and this is the one object an
//! exporter threads through [`crate::schema_convert::convert_step_line`] to
//! apply both:
//!
//! - `IfcRoot.OwnerHistory` is REUSED from an `IfcOwnerHistory` the export
//!   already writes ([`OwnerHistoryFill`], #4686). Nothing is invented,
//!   because an owner history asserts who made the model, with which
//!   application, when.
//! - Every other required slot is read from the generated
//!   [`IFC2X3_REQUIRED_SLOTS`] table. An enum with a `NOTDEFINED` member takes
//!   `.NOTDEFINED.` and a BOOLEAN takes `.F.`, the values that claim nothing.
//!   A measure, label, identifier or entity reference has no such value, so
//!   the slot keeps `$` and is COUNTED: the caller learns the file is not
//!   valid IFC2X3 rather than receiving a fabricated dimension.
//!
//! Twin of `packages/export/src/schema-converter-ifc2x3-slots.ts`.
