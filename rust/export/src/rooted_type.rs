//! Schema-driven `IfcRoot` rootedness check, extracted as a standalone unit.
//!
//! GlobalId reconciliation across a merged/federated STEP export first needs
//! to know which entity types actually carry a GlobalId as their first
//! attribute -- only `IfcRoot` subtypes do. A hand-maintained denylist of
//! "non-rooted types whose first attribute happens to be a string" is the
//! natural first cut, but it can only ever be as complete as whoever last
//! audited the schema for such types, and staleness fails silently: a
//! forgotten entry has its Name/Identifier misread as a GlobalId and
//! re-stamped, corrupting the entity.
//!
//! For example `IfcColourRgb` (upper-case `IFCCOLOURRGB`) inherits `Name :
//! OPTIONAL IfcLabel` as its first attribute from `IfcColourSpecification`,
//! an `IfcPresentationItem` -- not an `IfcRoot` subtype
//! (`packages/codegen/schemas/IFC4X3.exp:4972-4988`). A 22-character colour
//! name is exactly GlobalId-shaped and would be silently treated as one by
//! any denylist that omits `IFCCOLOURRGB`.
//!
//! This module asks the generated type universe directly via
//! [`ifc_lite_core::IfcType::is_subtype_of`], so rootedness follows EXPRESS
//! inheritance instead of a hand-maintained classification table. The three
//! documented exporter-only stratum spellings are the sole bounded exception;
//! unknown vendor names fail closed.

// Wired into `merged.rs`'s GlobalId reconciliation (`export_merged_with_stats`),
// which previously carried its own near-identical copy of this same
// schema-driven check -- exactly the "two lists that must agree" drift shape
// this module's own doc warns about (see #3015). `extract_leading_guid` is
// this crate's only sanctioned way to read a STEP line's leading GlobalId.
