//! Split out of `gltf.rs` to keep that module under its size ratchet; the logic is
//! unchanged, so instanced-occurrence placement (and the exported bytes) is identical.
//!
//! An occurrence's node matrix must map the shared template's Y-up LOCAL geometry
//! to that occurrence's Y-up BAKED world position, minus the model-wide
//! `scene_center` that the root node carries:
//!
//!   N_k = T(-scene_center) · B · (M_k · M_ref⁻¹) · B⁻¹ · T(template_origin_yup)
//!
//! where `M = transform · local · canonical` is the per-occurrence world placement
//! from `InstanceMeta` (Z-up, **pre-RTC**) and `B = S · Rᵀ · T(-rtc)` is everything
//! that happened to the vertices after `M` was captured: the model RTC/site offset
//! the baker subtracted (`rtc`, Z-up), the site placement's inverse rotation `Rᵀ`
//! the `site_local` tier baked in on top of it, and the Z-up→Y-up basis
//! `S: (x,y,z) → (x, z, -y)` the assembler applied. Conjugating by `B` moves the
//! relative transform from the pre-RTC native frame `M` lives in into the baked
//! frame the template geometry is actually in — without the `T(-rtc)` factor a
//! rotated occurrence under a non-zero site/georef offset is mis-translated by
//! `(R_rel - I)·rtc` (kilometres at national-grid scale), and without `Rᵀ` a
//! translated sibling under a yawed site is mis-translated by `(I - Rᵀ)·d`
//! (metres at building scale, #4118). Everything
//! is f64, recomputed from the f64 `InstanceMeta` (NOT the collator's f32 `rel`), so
//! the absolute-magnitude terms cancel to a small, f32-precise translation before the
