//! `IfcRoot.OwnerHistory` on a downgrade to IFC2X3 (#4686).
//!
//! OwnerHistory is OPTIONAL in IFC4 and IFC4X3 but MANDATORY in IFC2X3, so a
//! record the source wrote with `$` there is invalid once the header says
//! IFC2X3. The downgrade reuses an `IfcOwnerHistory` the export already
//! writes; it never invents one, because an owner history asserts who made
//! the model with which application and when, and the source did not say.
//! When the export keeps none, the slot stays `$` and the record is counted,
//! so the caller can report that the file is not valid IFC2X3.
//!
//! Twin of `packages/export/src/schema-converter-owner-history.ts`.
