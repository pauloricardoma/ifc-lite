//! Reading a STEP record's top-level argument list out of its text, for a
//! caller that then reads or writes one slot BY INDEX.
//!
//! The failure this module exists to prevent is silent. A scanner that loses
//! track of quote state or paren depth still produces parts; they are just not
//! the record's arguments any more, because the commas it swallowed took every
//! following slot with them. A write by index then lands on whatever the
//! mis-scan accumulated and the caller reports a success that did not happen
//! (LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#2470, #4125). So the split returns `None` rather than
//! parts it does not believe in, and both call sites in
//! [`crate::step_text`] treat `None` as "this edit cannot be made".
//!
//! This module deliberately grows no permissive variant. Both its callers
//! ([`crate::step_text::apply_attr_mutations_counted`] and
//! [`crate::step_text::attribute_of`]) index into the parts, and text that
//! reaches them comes from the user's file, so a permissive sibling here would
//! be a footgun with no consumer.
//!
//! Schema conversion uses this same splitter too: trimming and by-name remaps
//! must not build a second, permissive position-addressable array (#4200).
//!
//! The TypeScript twin is `packages/export/src/step-argument-parser.ts`'s
//! `splitTopLevelStepArguments`. The two cannot share code, so the inputs both
//! must refuse are pinned to one shared fixture,
//! `tests/fixtures/step_refuse_vectors.json` (see `step_slot_tests.rs`'s
//! `refuses_every_shared_cross_language_vector`
//! and `packages/export/src/step-refuse.parity.test.ts`) — the same arrangement
//! `step_escape_vectors.json` gives the two escapers (#3300). Only the REFUSE
//! side is shared, because the splitters in this repo diverge on what they
//! ACCEPT: this module and the export twin both keep a `/* ... */` comment's
//! bytes inside the slot that carries them, while the CLI's
//! `splitTopLevelStepArgs` refuses any slot carrying one — each contract is its
//! own caller's choice, and pinning an accept would freeze a divergence as if it
//! were agreement.
//!
//! One accept-side divergence from the export twin is NOT a chosen contract, and
//! is recorded here so the next reader does not have to measure it again: an
//! empty element INSIDE a nested list. `'g',(1,,2),'b'` is accepted by this
//! module as three slots and refused (`null`) by `splitTopLevelStepArguments`,
//! because this module extends the empty-slot rule below into nested lists and
//! the twin does not. Both measured directly, 2026-09-09. Changing either moves
//! one language's grammar with nothing pinning the other, so it is out of scope
//! for #4125 and tracked in LTplus-AG/ifc-lite#4200 with the rest of the
//! splitter unification.
//!
//! A SECOND accept-side divergence is deliberate, and the reason is asymmetric
//! rather than accidental: nesting depth. The export twin validates nested
//! values by recursion, so it bounds nesting at 64 and returns `null` past it,
//! because past roughly 3763 (measured cold; V8 shrinks the frames once warm,
//! so the cold figure is the floor) it would throw `RangeError` instead of
//! refusing, and a throw is an outcome no caller of that function handles. This
//! module walks the same grammar iteratively with an explicit `depth`, so it has
//! nothing to bound and accepts any depth. The deepest nesting inside a slot in
//! the 122-file real corpus is 3, so neither side refuses anything real; the
//! difference only shows on input no file contains. Not pinned in
//! `step_refuse_vectors.json`, which records what BOTH must refuse.

/// Split a STEP attribute list into its top-level arguments, or `None` when

/// `[]`, so `join(",")` is `""` and
/// [`crate::step_text::apply_attr_mutations_counted`] rewrites `#1=IFCFOO(   );`
/// to `#1=IFCFOO();`. That is deliberate: the TypeScript twin returns `[]` for
/// any input whose `trim()` is empty (measured directly, 2026-09-09), and a
/// record with no arguments has no slot for a by-index caller to write, so the
/// only bytes the exception can drop are padding that carries no value. Every
/// OTHER accepted input rejoins byte for byte, which
/// `accepted_parts_rejoin_to_the_input` pins.
///
/// Rejected:
///   - a quote still open at the end (unterminated string);
///   - a paren depth that does not return to zero, or that ever goes below it
///     (both ends matter: a depth that dips negative and climbs back looks
///     balanced at the end while every comma in between was read as nested);
///   - a part that is not one well-formed STEP value (see
///     [`is_well_formed_step_slot`]), which is what catches the mis-scans the
///     three checks above cannot see.
///
/// An EMPTY top-level slot (`a,,b`, or a trailing comma) is NOT rejected. It is
/// invalid STEP that costs no alignment: an empty argument is ONE part, exactly
/// as the entity parser counts it, so every index still names the attribute it
/// is meant to. An empty INPUT is not an empty slot: `#1=IFCFOO();` is a record
/// with no arguments, so it splits to `[]` and any slot request then fails the
/// caller's own bounds check.
///
/// A `/* ... */` COMMENT is KEPT, not refused: its bytes stay inside whichever
/// slot they sit in, and the scan steps over the whole region as one unit so a
/// comma, paren or apostrophe inside it cannot be read as structure. Comments
/// are valid ISO 10303-21 and this repo has met them in real files (#3789,
/// #4162); refusing a slot that carries one made every by-index write on such a
/// record drop, and made [`crate::step_text::attribute_of`] return `None` so
/// `step_cow`'s copy-on-write refused the whole copy when the REFERRER line
/// carried a comment. The export twin does the same thing with the same bytes.
/// A slot that is ONLY a comment is still refused — a comment is not a value, so
/// counting it as one more empty slot shifts every index after it, which is what
/// the third and fourth shared refuse vectors pin.
