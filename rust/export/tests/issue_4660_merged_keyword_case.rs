//! STEP entity keywords are case-insensitive per ISO 10303-21, and

//! it. The merged/federated export path reads `ModelIndex::type_of` with
//! case-sensitive comparisons — a `match` on `"IFCSITE" | "IFCBUILDING" |
//! "IFCBUILDINGSTOREY"` in `unify_spatial`, `== "IFCRELAGGREGATES"` before
//! the one-parent rule in the emit loop, `starts_with("IFCREL")` in
//! `is_relationship_type` and in the empty-container pruner, and an exact
//! `CONTAINER_TYPES.contains` in `is_container_type`. If `type_of` were stored
//! as written rather than folded once at population, a merged model spelling
//! its containers `ifcsite` / `IfcBuilding` / `IfcBuildingStorey` would pass
//! through unmatched and duplicate the shared spatial tree, and its empty
//! containers would never be pruned.
//!
//! These tests pin the merged export end to end on a recased fixture: the
//! mixed-case run must produce output *identical* to the all-uppercase
//! control, not merely be self-consistent. The control is asserted too, so a
//! fixture that merges nothing cannot pass trivially.
