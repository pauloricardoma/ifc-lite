//! STEP/IFC Parser using nom
//!
//! Zero-copy tokenization and fast entity scanning.
//!
//! Two independent algorithms live here:
//! - [`tokenizer`]: nom-combinator tokenization ([`Token`], [`parse_entity`]).
//! - [`scanner`]: a byte-level SIMD fast scanner ([`EntityScanner`]) that does
//!   its own hand-rolled parsing and never touches [`Token`] or nom.
//!
//! [`lexical`] holds one small piece shared by both, and by other crates:
//! [`skip_step_comment`] is the STEP `/* ... */` comment-skip rule, in one
//! place so every scanner that has no reason to answer "what does an
//! unterminated comment mean" differently gives the same answer (#3303).
//! [`keyword`] is the other shared rule: the scanner returns the keyword as
//! written and STEP keyword case is not significant, so every comparison
//! against a literal goes through [`keyword_eq`] and its siblings.
//! [`header`] reads ISO 10303-21 header records for exporters and source views.
