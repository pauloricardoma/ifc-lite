//! The STEP `/* ... */` comment-skip rule -- and, on top of it, the trivia
//! rule that says a comment is legal wherever whitespace is -- shared by every
//! scanner that has no reason to answer an unterminated comment differently
//! from the others.
//!
//! [`skip_step_comment`] answers an unterminated `/*` by refusing it: it
//! returns `None`, the same as "not a comment here" from the caller's point
//! of view. That is correct for a scanner walking already-located,
//! well-formed record bytes looking for structure — an unterminated comment
//! there means the input is corrupt, and silently consuming the rest of it
//! is worse than stopping. [`super::scanner::EntityScanner`] and
//! `ifc-lite-geometry`'s `IfcTriangulatedFaceSet` CoordIndex walk both used
//! to hand-roll this and disagreed with each other on exactly this case
//! (issue #3303); both now call this one function.
//!
//! The shared STEP HEADER prescan (`header::Lex`) answers the
//! same question differently, on purpose, and that is not the divergence
//! #3303 is about: a header prescan that swallows every later record has
//! lost the schema, so it treats an unterminated `/*` as ordinary text
//! instead of refusing. See the doc comment on `Lex::skip_comment_at` for
//! why that call site needs its own answer. It still calls this function to
//! find where a *closed* comment ends — only the unterminated case is
//! handled differently, and only at that one call site.

/// If a STEP `/* ... */` comment starts at `bytes[i]`, the index just past
/// its closing `*/`.
///
/// Returns `None` when `bytes[i]` doesn't begin a comment, and ALSO when it
/// does but no closing `*/` exists anywhere in `bytes` after it — an
/// unterminated comment is refused rather than silently run to end of input.
/// A caller that needs to tell those two `None` cases apart already knows
/// which one it's in, from having checked `bytes[i..i + 2] == b"/*"` itself
/// before calling (as every call site in this repo does), so the single
/// `Option` return doesn't lose information.

/// This doc is the one argument for a rule four scans implement:
/// [`EntityScanner::find_entity_end`](super::scanner) and this function in
/// Rust, `StepTokenizer.scanEntitiesFast` (`packages/parser/src/tokenizer.ts`)
/// with `packages/parser/src/step-record-boundary.ts` in TypeScript, and
/// `WORKER_CODE` (`packages/parser/src/scan-worker-source.ts`), which
/// hand-duplicates it because a Blob worker cannot import at runtime. Rust is
/// the source of truth per AGENTS.md; the halves are changed together.
///
/// ## The two rules
///
/// A "skip to the next unquoted `;`" scan is bounded only by end-of-buffer, so
/// a record missing its own `;` takes the first `;` it can reach — the NEXT
/// record's, or the footer's — reporting success while swallowing whatever lay
/// between. Two rules read off the ISO 10303-21 grammar bound it to the
/// record's own body:
///
///   * `simple_record` is `keyword '(' [parameter_list] ')'`, so the last
///     significant byte before the terminator is always `')'`. A `;` preceded
///     by anything else, as in `#2=IFCWALL('b')\nENDSEC;`, is the footer's.
///   * `'='` appears in the exchange structure only in
///     `entity_instance_name '=' record`, never inside a parameter list, so
///     one before the terminator, as in `#2=IFCB(2)\n#3=IFCC(3);`, means the
///     scan walked into the NEXT declaration.
///
/// Both are judged only on bytes outside strings and comments: an `=` in
/// either is text, and a comment between the `)` and the `;` is trivia.
///
/// The two are a cheap approximation of one general property — *the `;` is the
/// first non-trivia byte after the `)` balancing the record's own `(`* — which
/// is what THIS function computes exactly. The approximation is deliberate:
/// the exact rule costs a full paren balance per record on the hottest
/// structural path, so it runs only where a byte test already refused. It is
/// strictly weaker, and admits shapes the exact rule rejects, `#2=IFCB(2) (3);`
/// among them.
///
/// ## Why the scan stops at the next `=`
///
/// The second rule above binds HERE too, and for the same reason: a `)` found
/// after a top-level `=` closes some LATER record's parameter list, never this
/// one's. Reporting it would hand back a resume point past a record the scan
/// has not read, which drops that record outright — `#1=A(2 #2=IFCWALL($));`
/// balanced at #2's `)` and resumed past it, losing #2.
///
/// It is also what bounds the walk. Without it a record with no `)` of its own
/// walks to end of input to answer [`RecordClose::Unbalanced`], the caller
/// resumes one byte past the `#`, and the NEXT declaration repeats the whole
/// walk: a file of `#1=A(2;` repeated is clean O(n^2), measured 16.2s at 80 000
/// records (0.6 MB) and rising 4x per doubling. With the bound each refusal
/// costs its own record's bytes, so the total is the file length however many
/// records are malformed. `close_step_record` is on every untrusted-bytes entry
/// point (`entity_count`, `build_entity_index`, `ColumnarEntityIndex::from_scan`,
/// the wasm prepass, the server's parse routes), so that shape was reachable
/// from a plain upload.
///
/// The TypeScript half (`findEntityLength`, `step-record-boundary.ts`, and the
/// hand-duplicate in `scan-worker-source.ts`) is tracked as #4573: it carries
/// neither bound, so the browser scan worker takes the same quadratic shape
/// and still balances past a following declaration.
///
/// ## Why a refusal RECOVERS instead of stopping
///
/// 10303-21 closes every record's parameter list, so the `)` this function
/// finds is a real grammar boundary even when the `;` after it is missing.
/// That lets the scan drop the ONE broken record and carry on. The rest of the
/// file is not the malformed record's to take: a shard whose scanner stops
/// hands back no handoff, and both stitches — `stitchShards`
/// (`packages/geometry/src/shard-stitch.ts`) and the native
/// `parallel_scan::stitch` — read that as "no more real entities" and discard
/// every LATER shard, including bytes those shards already scanned cleanly.
/// Measured on a 40-record file whose #20 lost its `;`, at four shards: 40
/// records in, 19 out. An unterminated string or comment has no such `)`,
/// nothing to resume from, so that case still stops as #3695 set it.
///
/// A string literal is jumped whole and a `/* … */` comment after it, in that
/// order, so a `(` or `)` inside either is text; the same rule and the same
/// order the scanner's own body walk uses. The matched TypeScript half is
/// `findEntityLength` in `packages/parser/src/step-lexing.ts`.
