//! Bounds on walks over file-supplied entity references, plus the
//! large-coordinate threshold every crate gates the RTC re-base on
//! ([`LARGE_COORD_THRESHOLD_METERS`]).
//!
//! A cap bounds one path's LENGTH only. A walk that can revisit also needs a
//! cycle guard, and one that fans out over a DAG also needs a work budget; the
//! three are not interchangeable and choosing wrongly fails silently in both
//! directions. The rule for picking, and the scope rule for the visited set,
//! are in AGENTS.md under "Bounding walks over file-supplied references" —
//! there rather than here, because whoever needs it is adding a NEW walk
//! somewhere else and will not open this file.

/// Maximum `IfcMappedItem` → `IfcRepresentationMap` → `MappedRepresentation.Items`
/// nesting any walk in this workspace will follow.
///
/// Shared because three crates walk the SAME chain and their bounds must agree:
/// `ifc_lite_processing::element`, `ifc_lite_geometry::router::processing` and
/// `ifc-lite-wasm`'s styling colour resolver.
///
/// Disagreement fails SILENTLY, which is why it is worth making structural. A
/// mid-review revision of #2864 held 16 against the router's 32: an element
/// whose chain was 17 to 32 links long would have rendered its geometry and
/// quietly lost its authored colour. That was caught before merge and never
/// shipped — the point is that nothing except a reviewer's attention was
/// stopping it.
///
/// `ifc_lite_processing::symbolic::item_walk::MAX_ITEM_DEPTH` also walks this
/// chain and asserts equality with this constant, but deliberately keeps its
/// own name: it charges `depth + 1` for `IfcGeometricSet` elements and
/// `IfcCompositeCurve` segments as well, so an equal number does not mean equal
/// reach. It is never more permissive than this one.
///
/// A walk over this chain also needs a cycle guard; the cap alone is not
/// sufficient (see the module docs above for which kind).
pub const MAX_MAPPED_ITEM_DEPTH: u32 = 32;

/// Maximum `IfcLocalPlacement.PlacementRelTo` chain any walk in this workspace
/// will follow. A chain longer than this composes only its first
/// `MAX_PLACEMENT_DEPTH + 1` placements and the rest is dropped — silently, on
/// every site that uses it.
///
/// Shared because two walks follow the SAME attribute of the SAME entity and
/// their bounds must agree: `ifc_lite_geometry::router::transforms` (the mesh
/// path) and `ifc_lite_geometry::profile_extractor` (the 2D drawing path).
/// They disagreed — 32 against 100 — and because both exceed-branches return
/// the IDENTITY rather than an error, an element on a 33-to-101-link chain was
/// drawn in two different places by the two paths with nothing reported. #2873
///
/// ## Why 100 and not 32
///
/// The 32 carried the rationale "keep low for WASM — each frame uses ~2KB+ of
/// stack". The wasm bundles are linked with `-zstack-size=8388608`
/// (`.cargo/config.toml` and both extra bundles in `scripts/build-wasm.sh`), so
/// the budget is 8 MiB and the cap's own worst case is ~0.1% of it; native
/// hosts give the geometry pool 256 MiB (`rust/ffi`, `rust/python`). Measured
/// rather than assumed: see the frame figures in #2873. `PlacementRelTo` is a
/// single reference, so this walk has fan-out 1 and costs O(depth) — the
/// breadth blow-up that makes a depth cap the wrong instrument elsewhere (see
/// AGENTS.md) does not apply here.
///
/// The two candidates are not symmetric. Equalising UP lets the mesh path
/// compose chains it currently flattens; equalising DOWN would make the 2D path
/// start flattening chains it composes correctly today, silently. Across the
/// 111 fixtures in `tests/models` that contain placements the deepest chain is
/// 7 links, so neither value binds on any file in the corpus and the choice is
/// decided entirely by which failure is worse on a file that does exceed it.
///
/// This bounds one path's LENGTH only. A walk over a chain that can revisit
/// also needs a cycle guard; see the module docs above.
pub const MAX_PLACEMENT_DEPTH: usize = 100;

/// The large-coordinate threshold (metres): a world coordinate whose magnitude
/// exceeds this needs RTC re-basing before it is cast to f32, or the model
/// renders with vertex jitter.
///
/// Shared because every crate that decides "is this model far from the
/// origin" must draw the line in the same place: a copy that drifts fails
/// silently (one side re-bases, the other does not, and the two frames differ
/// by the whole offset). It lives in `ifc_lite_core` because core's own
/// placement-bounds scan needs it and cannot import from above;
/// `ifc_lite_geometry` re-exports it under the same name.
///
/// Prefer [`coord_is_large`] to comparing against this directly, so the
/// comparison (strictly greater, any axis, absolute value) also has one home.
///
/// ## Why 1 km and not 10 km (#4934)
///
/// The line is precision-derived, not distance-derived: it is the point past
/// which the f32 store the mesh path casts into loses more than a BIM
/// tolerance. f32 has a 24-bit mantissa, so its ULP near `x` is
/// `2^(exponent(x) - 23)`; at 1 km that is ~0.061 mm, and at the old 10 km
/// line it is ~0.5-1 mm — comparable to the flush-face tolerances authoring
/// tools actually hit, so two faces meant to be coincident round to
/// *different* f32 lattice nodes and z-fight (#4934's report: 6.3 km survey
/// coordinates, ~0.26 mm ULP, visible speckle over every join). 1 km keeps
/// worst-case quantization at a fraction of a millimetre while matching the
/// existing `NEAR_ORIGIN` band in `rust/geometry/src/router/rtc_offset.rs`,
/// so a model just inside the line and the detector's own "already near the
/// origin" judgment agree.
