//! Hand-maintained schema helpers built on top of the auto-generated
//! `IfcType` enum.
//!
//! These helpers used to live appended to `generated/schema.rs` despite that
//! file's "DO NOT EDIT" header. Moving them here keeps them safe from a
//! re-run of `@ifc-lite/codegen` and lets us derive answers from the EXPRESS
//! inheritance graph instead of maintaining a leaf-level allow-list that has
//! to be amended every time a new IFC4X3 subtype shows up (see PR #585 for
//! `IfcSolarDevice`, which inherits from `IfcEnergyConversionDevice` and was
//! therefore already covered conceptually by the old whitelist's parent
//! entry, but missed in practice because the whitelist was only checked by
//! string match).
//!
//! Co-authored with Geronimo <gerald.stampfel+geronimo@gmail.com> (PR #585).
//!
//! `has_geometry_by_name`, `is_representationless_spatial_container_by_name`
//! and `is_simple_geometry_type` are all on the hot path during scene
//! construction, where the same ~50–100 distinct type names are queried
//! millions of times per file. An immutable, schema-derived table memoises
//! all generated names and bounded exporter aliases without taking a read-lock for each entity.
//! Unknown names use the same predicates without entering a growing cache.
