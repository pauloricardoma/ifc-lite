//! WASM API: `clashIntersectionSolid` — the overlap VOLUME of one clashing
//! pair, as a solid the viewer can draw opaque while ghosting both parents
//! (the BIMcollab Zoom / Solibri presentation).
//!
//! On demand, one pair at a time. A model here yields 81 clashes and computing
//! every intersection during the detection sweep would be a large regression;
//! this is meant to be called when a clash row is selected, exactly like the
//! existing `@ifc-lite/clash/contact` path.
//!
//! Both operands must already be in the COMMON WORLD FRAME. For a federated
//! pair that means the models' world transforms are baked into `positions`
//! before the call — `ClashElement.transform` is NOT applied here and cannot be
//! detected as missing. `@ifc-lite/clash`'s wasm kernel already bakes it in
//! `WasmKernel.prepare`; a caller on the TS backend must do the same.
//!
//! The result is deliberately not always a solid. See
//! `ifc_lite_geometry::clash_solid` for why a shallow overlap is withheld
//! rather than reported wrong; when `isSolid` is false the viewer should keep
//! the contact marker it already draws.
