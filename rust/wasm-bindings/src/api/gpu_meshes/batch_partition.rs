//! The routing rules `batch.rs` applies to a produced batch: which meshes may
//! ride the instanced shard, how per-batch repetition is tallied, and the
//! prepass style-colour wire decode.
//!
//! Split out of `batch.rs` because these are the parts of it that are decidable
//! without a file, a decoder or a JS clock — everything else there needs the
//! whole producer. Keeping them here also means the shard-template eligibility
//! check and the partition's candidate gate are ONE function rather than two
//! copies of the same three conditions in the same file: they must agree (a
//! mesh the partition sends to the shard but the template pass judged
//! ineligible has nothing to instance against), and two copies is how they stop
//! agreeing.
