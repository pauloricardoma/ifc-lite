    /// Sweep every registered processor's own boolean-failure log into this
    /// router's map. Called by [`Self::take_csg_failures`], so a consumer that
    /// already drains the router — the native pipeline via
    /// `produce_element_meshes`, the wasm batch path via
    /// `drain_and_log_csg_diagnostics` — picks these up with no second opt-in.
    ///
    /// Before #3821 `BooleanClippingProcessor::take_failures` was called from
    /// tests ONLY. Everything the boolean processor recorded (an unsupported
    /// operand, an `EmptyOperand` cutter, an unknown operator) accumulated in a
    /// `RefCell` no production caller ever read, so a model whose booleans all
    /// degraded still reported a clean load: absence was indistinguishable from
    /// success.
    ///
    /// Bucketed under [`UNATTRIBUTED_PRODUCT_ID`] — the same "no attribution
    /// available" bucket `take_csg_failures` already uses for
    /// `PENDING_MAPPED_BOOL_FAILURES`. A processor is registered once per
    /// router and reused across every item it meshes, so at drain time its log
    /// is not attributable to one product from in here.
    ///
    /// What that bucket does and does NOT preserve, precisely: the native and
    /// wasm pipelines both drain PER ELEMENT (`produce_element_meshes` takes
    /// the router's failures after each job), so a record can never be
    /// mis-attributed to a DIFFERENT element — it is attributed to none. The
    /// element it came from is lost, so these records do not appear in the
    /// per-product `worst_hosts` detail and are excluded from
    /// `products_with_failures` (see [`super::count_attributed_products`]);
    /// they do count towards the failure totals and the reason breakdown.
    /// Real per-product attribution would mean threading the owning product id
    /// down to every `processor.process` call site; that is a follow-up, not a
    /// reason to keep dropping the records.
    ///
    /// `register` stores ONE `Rc` per custom processor under each supported IFC type
    /// (`IfcBooleanResult` and `IfcBooleanClippingResult` share an instance),
    /// so iterating custom registrations can visit the same processor twice; the second visit
    /// drains an already-emptied log and contributes nothing. No double count.
