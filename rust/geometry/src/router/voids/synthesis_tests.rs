// --- issue #4119: opening classification gates on TRIANGLE count, not the
// raw position-buffer length -----------------------------------------------
//
// `classify_openings_impl`'s high-complexity gate (this file, above) has TWO
// exits that both label an opening `NonRectangular`, but they hand back
// DIFFERENT mesh data:
//
//   - the `triangle_count > 100 && !separable_bodies` branch hands back
//     `opening_mesh`, sourced from `self.process_element` — which runs
//     through `apply_placement` and so arrives WELDED (#4103).
//   - the per-item else-branch (reached when that gate is false but the
//     item isn't a clean box) hands back `item_mesh`, sourced from
//     `get_opening_item_meshes_world` (`probe.rs`) — which bakes with
//     `transform_mesh_world_framed` directly and is NEVER welded (#4122).
//
// So a mesh whose WELDED vertex count already dips at/under 100 while its
// (weld-invariant) triangle count stays over 100 is exactly the fixture that
// tells the two gates apart: reverting the fix (back to `vertex_count > 100`)
// silently swaps which of those two meshes — and hence which vertex count —
// the returned `OpeningType::NonRectangular` carries, even though the
// diagnostic `kind` label is `NonRectangular` either way.
