/// Per-undirected-edge MULTIPLICITY defects, the class both predicates above
/// are structurally blind to.
///
/// [`directed_closed`] and [`closed_or_hairline`] both count edges with a
/// SIGNED tally (`+1` forward, `-1` reverse) and pass when everything nets to
/// zero. Cancellation is the point there — it is what makes a hairline
/// T-junction chain forgivable — but it also erases multiplicity: an edge used
/// by FOUR triangles, two each way, nets to exactly zero and reads as closed.
/// That is a doubled coincident surface, not a solid boundary, and no amount of
/// tolerance tuning on a signed tally can see it.
///
/// So this counts UNSIGNED uses per undirected edge and reports the two
/// defects a signed tally cannot represent:
///
/// * `over_used` — an undirected edge with MORE than two triangle uses
///   (non-manifold: a fin, a doubled skin, or self-intersecting output).
/// * `same_direction` — an undirected edge with exactly two uses that run the
///   SAME way round (inconsistent winding: one of the two neighbours is
///   flipped).
///
/// An edge used ONCE is deliberately NOT a defect here. That is an open
/// boundary, which is what the two closure predicates above already measure,
/// and it is the reading that T-junction tessellation trips constantly. Keeping
/// it out is what lets a caller gate on this without inheriting that class's
/// false-positive rate.
///
/// # Why this one is EXACT and its neighbours are not
///
/// The two predicates above snap vertices to a 0.1 mm grid. That is right for
/// them: they ask whether a surface CLOSES, and two corners a hair apart
/// should close. It is wrong here, and not by a little. Snapping merges two
/// distinct vertices closer than a grid cell into one key, and the moment two
/// distinct edges collapse onto one key their uses ADD — so two perfectly
/// manifold surfaces sitting 0.03 mm apart report a four-use edge that exists
/// in neither of them. Measured on the snapped key this replaced: the two
/// closed bipyramids in `closure_checks_tests.rs`, offset 0.03 mm, report
/// `over_used = 12`, and the 0.05 mm slab there reports `over_used = 1` — both
/// entirely manufactured by the snap, and both clean under exact keys.
///
/// That failure mode is fatal for a REJECTION predicate in a way it is not for
/// a closure one. A snap that wrongly closes a hairline gap errs toward
/// accepting; a snap that wrongly fuses two surfaces errs toward throwing away
/// geometry that was never wrong. So the keys here are the vertex coordinates
/// EXACTLY, bit for bit (with `-0.0` folded to `0.0` so the two spellings of
/// zero are one point). Two positions are the same point only if they are the
/// same position.
///
/// The cost is a miss, not a false positive: a genuine non-manifold edge whose
/// endpoints differ in the last bit reads as two separate edges and is not
/// reported. That is the right trade for a predicate whose job is to discard a
/// kernel result — and it is cheap in practice, because the kernel interns
/// coincident corners, so a real shared edge in its output is bit-identical at
/// both ends.
