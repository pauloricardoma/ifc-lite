//! Unit tests for [`super`]'s mesh-topology predicates. Split into a
//! `*_tests.rs` file (module-size-ratchet exempt) and attached via `#[path]`,
//! the shape `csg_tests.rs` / `prism_cut_tests.rs` already use.
//!
//! Each test below pairs the new multiplicity reading with the OLD signed
//! predicates on the SAME mesh. That pairing is the point: a test that only
//! asserted `over_used == 1` would still pass if `directed_closed` had been
//! quietly strengthened to catch the same thing, and the reader could not tell
//! which predicate was load-bearing. Asserting that the signed tally says
//! "closed" on a mesh the multiplicity sweep rejects pins the gap this module
//! exists to close.
