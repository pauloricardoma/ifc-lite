//! Structural analysis element representations (#4206). Deliberately
//! not folded into [`super::rep_filter::is_body_representation`]: an
//! `IfcStructuralCurveMember`'s `'Edge'` and an `IfcStructuralSurfaceMember`'s
//! `'Face'` representation are reference topology, not body geometry, and
//! must not become eligible for void probing or material-layer slicing.
//! RTC detection handles structural Face topology explicitly because its
//! boundary coordinates can themselves carry the model's georeference. Mirrors
//! `super::annotation::accepts`, the same OR-escape-hatch pattern used for
//! `IfcAnnotation` fills.
