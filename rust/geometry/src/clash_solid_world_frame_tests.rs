//! World-frame corpus coverage for the intersection-solid trust gate.
//!
//! `intersection_solid` gates on `TRUST_BAND_MULTIPLE * band`, where `band`
//! used to come from `near_band_from_extent(operand_extent(a, b))` —
//! `operand_extent` being the max |coordinate| over ALL THREE axes of both
//! operands, the milder shared form of the #2598/#2600/#2529 class. The
//! thickness it gates is measured along the contact normal (Z here), whose
//! f32 noise does not grow with an X offset; deriving the requirement from
//! the X magnitude made the SAME genuine 5 mm overlap a `Solid` at the origin
//! and `BelowKernelResolution` 10 km out. The corpus places the identical
//! pair in both frames; a frame-correct gate answers identically.
//!
//! Fixed by projecting the operands' per-axis extents onto the SAME axis the
//! thickness is measured along (`NearBand::scaled_band2`, `operand_near_band`
//! in `clash_solid.rs`), exactly as `near_band.rs` already does for the
//! kernel's own near-coplanar reconciliation. `a_5mm_overlap_10km_out_in_x_
//! must_still_be_a_solid` below used to assert the correct behaviour under
//! `#[should_panic]`, documenting the defect without silently rotting; now
//! that the gate is frame-correct it asserts the same thing as a normal
//! passing test.
