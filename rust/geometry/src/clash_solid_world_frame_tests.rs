//! World-frame corpus coverage for the intersection-solid trust gate.
//!
//! `intersection_solid` gates on `TRUST_BAND_MULTIPLE *
//! near_band_from_extent(operand_extent(a, b))`, and `operand_extent` is the
//! max |coordinate| over ALL THREE axes of both operands — the milder shared
//! form of the #2598/#2600/#2529 class. The thickness it gates is measured
//! along the contact normal (Z here), whose f32 noise does not grow with an
//! X offset; deriving the requirement from the X magnitude makes the SAME
//! genuine 5 mm overlap a `Solid` at the origin and `BelowKernelResolution`
//! 10 km out. The corpus places the identical pair in both frames; a
//! frame-correct gate answers identically.
//!
//! The known-failing case asserts the CORRECT behaviour under
//! `#[should_panic]`: when the gate learns the normal-projected band, the
//! assertion stops panicking, the `should_panic` itself fails, and the
//! attribute must be removed — the corpus cannot rot silently. The expectation
//! string names the WITHHELD panic specifically (`world-frame corpus
//! [withheld]`), so a partial fix that starts trusting the far solid but
//! computes the wrong volume hits the textually distinct `[wrong-volume]`
//! assertion and fails, instead of matching the attribute and still reading as
//! the known failure.
