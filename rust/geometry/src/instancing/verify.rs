//! Per-group reconstruction verification for `collate_refs` (issue #3666).
//!
//! `rep_identity` is documented as a guarantee that every occurrence sharing
//! it bakes from the SAME canonical geometry, but the guarantee is only as
//! strong as the hash behind it. A run over a large multi-model merge found
//! 28 of 6395 occurrences (11 `rep_identity` groups) where that did not hold:
//! reconstructing an occurrence from its template and per-instance transform
//! landed up to 2.0m away from the occurrence's own baked vertices — a
//! `rep_identity` collision between unrelated geometry from different source
//! models, with nothing on the path erroring, warning, or logging. The
//! occurrence still rendered, just in the wrong place.
//!
//! `collate_refs` previously trusted `rep_identity` outright: it computed
//! `rel` for every member of a group from placement metadata alone, with no
//! way to notice a wrong pairing (the exact-tier guard only compared vertex
//! and index COUNTS, which a same-shaped colliding pair still passes). This
//! module reconstructs each occurrence's own baked world vertices from
//! `(template, rel)` and compares them against the occurrence's OWN baked
//! vertices — the same computation `verify_recomposition` already performs
//! as an out-of-band diagnostic/test helper — but run inline, per candidate
//! pairing, on the production path, so a failing group falls back to the
//! flat (unshared) path instead of shipping a mis-grouped occurrence.
//!
//! Scoped to the exact tier only (see `collate_refs`): the RIGID tier
//! substitutes a congruent-but-not-bit-identical template by design, so its
//! members can legitimately carry a different raw vertex count than the
//! template — this check would reject correct rigid groups, not just
//! colliding ones. Rigid-tier congruence is established (and, per its own
//! doc comment, verified) upstream of collation via `canonical_transform`.
//!
//! **Frame contract.** `verify_pairing` reconstructs by applying `rel` — which
//! is always computed from `InstanceMeta.transform`, native-frame (IFC Z-up) —
//! to the template's OWN baked vertices, so the comparison is only valid when
//! the baked vertices it is handed (`template.positions`/`mesh.positions`) are
//! ALSO in that native frame. `collate_refs_in_basis`'s `baked_basis`
//! parameter exists because the glTF exporter's in-memory assembler converts
//! every visible mesh's baked positions Z-up→Y-up BEFORE calling in (so the
//! template/flat geometry it emits is already Y-up), while `InstanceMeta`
//! itself stays Z-up throughout — the per-occurrence node matrix is
//! independently recomposed and Y-up-conjugated downstream (`occurrence_node_matrix`
//! in the export crate), never reading this module's `rel` back. The same
//! parameter now also carries the site-local inverse rotation `Rᵀ` that
//! `convert_mesh_to_site_local` bakes into positions after `InstanceMeta` was
//! captured (#4118), and — since #4118 — it conjugates the EMITTED `rel` as
//! well as the one checked here, for the consumers that read `rel` back
//! instead of recomputing. Left
//! unaccounted for, that frame mismatch reads as a `rep_identity` collision on
//! nearly every rotated group in a real model (a Z-up `rel` reconstructing
//! against Y-up vertices), which is what motivated this parameter rather than
//! loosening [`tolerance`] — the mismatch is orders of magnitude larger than
//! any plausible tolerance, in either direction, at every coordinate scale.
