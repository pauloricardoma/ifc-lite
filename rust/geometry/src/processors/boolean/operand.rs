/// may ENTER, every path counted.
///
/// The third bound from AGENTS.md "Bounding walks over file-supplied
/// references": `MAX_BOOLEAN_DEPTH` bounds nesting, `MAX_OPERAND_PATH_NODES`
/// bounds one path's length, and the path-scoped set breaks cycles, but none
/// of them sees a DAG that fans out. `m` spine nodes per level whose
/// SecondOperands all point at the same next-level boolean re-mesh that
/// boolean `m` times, `m^levels` in all, from a few dozen STEP entities and
/// with nothing repeating on any path. `kernel::budget` cannot help: it
/// counts exact-tier predicate escalations, and a fan-out of cheap box
/// booleans escalates zero times.
///
/// Why 1024: spine (FirstOperand) nodes are walked iteratively and never
/// charged, so an unshared tree of spine width `w` under
/// `MAX_BOOLEAN_DEPTH` (10) charges about `w^10` SecondOperand entries;
/// 1024 is that bound at width 2, and a wider unshared tree that deep is
/// not a shape files have (real items enter this walk a handful of times;
/// a CSG tree enters each primitive once, so this is roughly a thousand
/// primitives under one item). The adversarial DAG crosses it at fan-out 4
/// by the fifth level.
///
/// Every attempt is charged monotonically, including provisional PBHS batch
/// attempts that later defer. Refunding completed work lets nested deferrals
/// repeat the same subtree exponentially while retaining only linear visits.
/// A future memo may make that work cheap; until then the budget refuses it.
