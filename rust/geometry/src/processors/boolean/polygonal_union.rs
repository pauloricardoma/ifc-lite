//! Original cutter union for the bounded roof-chain subtraction (#3925).

    ///
    /// The segmented-roof cutters are prisms that ABUT along shared, exactly-
    /// coplanar faces (adjacent roof facets meeting at a hip/ridge/valley).
    /// Unioning them into a single cutter is what lets the chain be subtracted
    /// ONCE (no seam fins, no deep-chain depth drops — issue #960).
    ///
    /// **Measured contract, not an enforced one (issue #3980):** despite the
    /// "watertight" language this comment used to carry, neither the primary
    /// path (`union_many_preserving_coordinates` + `consolidate_coplanar`) nor
    /// the `union_meshes` fallback is checked for closure here — only for
    /// nonemptiness. `None` is returned for empty input, or when the primary
    /// result is empty and the fallback is empty or errors; the caller then
    /// defers to the sequential per-cutter path. An exact
    /// bit-identical directed-edge closure check against the real #960
    /// fixture (five walls, `960_house_segmented_roof_clip.ifc`) found this
    /// union closed on only 1 of 5 real chains — the rest had open boundary
    /// edges, and some had degenerate (zero-length) edges — yet all were
    /// accepted, because nothing here rejects them. What actually stands
    /// between a non-closed union and a wrong subtraction is downstream, in
    /// the caller (`try_union_polygonal_chain` in `super::mod`): its
    /// intersected-bounds check and the `#3919` accept-gate on the actual
    /// subtract. On the #960 fixture's walls #2152 and #5904 those
    /// downstream checks were sufficient — every wall's Z bounds agreed with
    /// IfcOpenShell within the test's 25 mm tolerance — but that is evidence
    /// for those walls, not a closure guarantee this function provides.
