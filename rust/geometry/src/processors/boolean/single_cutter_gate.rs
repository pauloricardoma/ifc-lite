//! #3923: the accept-gate-rejection decision for `apply_boolean_step`'s
//! single-cutter `IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace` branch. Split out of
//! `mod.rs` (module-size ratchet) since it carries its own non-trivial
//! rationale, mirroring how `polygonal_prism.rs` already isolates
//! `subtract_checked`'s #3919 sibling logic.

    /// one of several nodes from a longer authored chain that couldn't be
    /// batched at any level and is now being applied one cutter at a time
    /// (House.ifc wall #2152, issue #960), AND when this is the single
    /// leftover spine node but a nested `try_union_polygonal_chain` batch
    /// already folded its own siblings into the mesh one level down — that
    /// lone node's cutter is not alone either, even though `spine.len() ==
    /// 1` for it (a longer chain whose top-level batch fails only because of
    /// this outermost cutter, while the suffix below it batches cleanly).
    ///
    /// `subtract_checked` (the #3919 helper `polygonal_prism.rs` already
    /// uses for the batched-chain path) folds in the accept-gate check: a
    /// gate rejection used to hand `mesh` back UN-CUT, the identical shape
    /// `subtract_mesh` used for "nothing to cut here", which
    /// `difference_result_looks_degenerate` cannot tell apart (an unchanged
    /// mesh is trivially non-degenerate relative to itself). Pre-#3923 this
    /// branch accepted that un-cut host as the final clip result instead of
    /// falling through to its own more-robust `clip_mesh_with_half_space`
    /// fallback.
    ///
    /// But that fallback is only a strict SUPERSET of the bounded cut — it
    /// is exactly correct when the polygon already covers the host's full
    /// projected cross-section (duplex.ifc "Party Wall"), and an OVER-cut
    /// otherwise, removing material a partial cutter's polygon never
    /// intended to touch. A roof/trim cutter that is only ONE of several
    /// sequential steps is rarely full-cross-section, so escalating to the
    /// unbounded clip there is unsafe: measured on House.ifc wall #2152
    /// under `csg_topology_gate`, falling through at its first (innermost)
    /// cutter reads max Z 3686 mm against its 7325 mm bar, while keeping
    /// that one step's un-cut host — an adjacent cutter in the same
    /// sequential chain typically covers the same material — reads 7325 mm,
    /// matching IfcOpenShell. So a gate rejection defers to
    /// [`SingleCutterSubtract::KeepUncut`] when `!solo_step`, and only the
    /// true single-cutter case (no sibling cutter to compensate) escalates
    /// to [`SingleCutterSubtract::FallThrough`]. The pre-existing
    /// empty/kernel-error/degenerate triggers are unaffected by `solo_step`
    /// and always fall through, exactly as before #3923.
