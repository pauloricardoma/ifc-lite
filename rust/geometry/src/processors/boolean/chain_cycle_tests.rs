///
/// Chain (innermost first): `G` (a plain 10x10x10 box) `-cutterF2->` `H`

/// attempts to batch all three cutters together first
/// (`try_union_polygonal_chain`, verified below via bounds/failure evidence,
/// not asserted directly on private state). `cutterE`'s polygonal boundary
/// is a self-intersecting (bowtie) `IfcPolyline` — a structurally invalid
/// polygon whose extruded prism makes the CSG subtract produce a torn,
/// non-closed result. That trips the accept gate for the 3-cutter batch
/// attempt at `E`, so it defers; `process_with_depth_inner` pushes `E` onto
/// `spine` and walks down to `F`, whose OWN 2-cutter batch (`cutterF1`,
/// `cutterF2` — both ordinary, non-degenerate half-space slabs) succeeds
/// cleanly. That leaves `spine == [E]` with `based_on_batch == true`: the
/// exact shape `solo_step == spine.len() == 1` mis-reads as "no sibling".

/// Applying `E`'s own step then re-hits the SAME bowtie-cutter accept-gate
/// rejection, this time via `apply_boolean_step`'s single-cutter
/// `IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace` branch
/// (`BooleanClippingProcessor::resolve_single_cutter_subtract`). Pre-fix,
/// `solo_step` is wrongly `true` there, so the rejection escalates to
/// `SingleCutterSubtract::FallThrough` — the unbounded plane clip at
/// `cutterE`'s plane (z = 2, agreement removes z > 2) — collapsing the
/// batched `F`/`H` result down to z in `[0, 2]` and x/y in `[-5, 3]`
/// (`F`'s own x > 3 slab already capped x at 3). Post-fix, `based_on_batch`
/// makes `solo_step` correctly `false`, so the same rejection instead takes
/// `SingleCutterSubtract::KeepUncut`: `E`'s cutter is dropped and the
/// batched `F`/`H` result (x, y in `[-5, 5]`, z in `[0, 10]`) is returned
/// un-cut.
///
/// Verified directly (not asserted, since it reads private state): on this
