//! The intersection SOLID of a clashing pair — the overlap volume itself, as a
//! mesh the viewer can draw opaque while ghosting both parents (the BIMcollab
//! Zoom / Solibri presentation). A contact point tells you two elements touch;
//! this tells you how deep, in what shape, and in which direction.
//!
//! # On demand, never eager
//!
//! One model here yields 81 clashes. This entry point computes ONE pair and is
//! meant to be called when a clash row is selected, exactly like the existing
//! on-demand `@ifc-lite/clash/contact` path. Nothing in the detection sweep
//! calls it.
//!
//! # Why this is gated, and what the gate is
//!
//! The exact CSG kernel snaps every input coordinate to
//! [`SNAP_GRID`](crate::kernel::mesh_bridge) = `2^-16 m ≈ 15.26 µm` and treats
//! faces within [`near_band_from_extent`] of each other as coplanar. Inside that
//! band a thin overlap is not a thin solid — it is a *coplanar contact*, and the
//! arrangement returns a wedge rather than the slab. Measured on the analytic
//! box oracle (`tests/clash_intersection_oracle.rs`), a slab overlap reports:
//!
//! | penetration depth | reported volume |
//! |---|---|
//! | ≤ 8 snap cells (≤ 122 µm) | exactly **2/3** of the truth (−33 %), at every world scale |
//! | 10–24 cells (153–366 µm) | high by 5e-5 (at the origin) to 0.33 (at 1000 m) |
//! | ≥ 4 × the near band | **exact**, to f64, at every tessellation and world scale |
//!
//! So a naive "call the kernel and show the answer" API would draw a solid that
//! is a third too small for precisely the shallow clashes a coordinator cares
//! most about — and would report a volume for a 15 µm graze as if it meant
//! something. This module therefore refuses to return a solid it cannot stand
//! behind, and says why. The viewer draws the existing contact marker instead.
//!
//! This is a real limit, not a conservatism knob: below the near band there is
//! no exact solid to compute, only a coplanar contact, and the arrangement's
//! own output cannot tell you otherwise. **No intersection solid exists for
//! those pairs at this kernel's resolution**, and inventing one would be a
//! sliver, not a finding.
//!
//! Note what the sub-micron distances this kernel reports are NOT: evidence of
//! fine coordination issues. `TriMesh` ingests geometry as `f32` and queries it
//! in `f64`, so those distances land on the `f32` ULP at the pair's coordinate
//! magnitude — `2^-22 m ≈ 0.238 µm` for coordinates in `[2, 4)` — repeated
//! bit-identically across unrelated pairs, which is the signature of a
//! quantization floor rather than a physical graze. Do not state a real-world
//! graze distance here without a reproducible per-pair measurement behind it.

    // WHICH DIRECTION that thickness is measured along is the other half of the
    // argument, and measuring it against the WORLD axes (as this did until the
    // #2573 review) is only right when the contact normal happens to be
    // parallel to one. Rotate the oracle's own 15–122 µm slab overlaps
    // obliquely and the wedge's min world-axis extent jumps to ~0.6 m: the gate
    // passed every one of them, and the volumes it returned ranged from 36 % to
    // 103 % of the truth, drifting with tessellation
    // (`rotated_near_band_overlap_is_withheld_exactly_as_the_axis_aligned_
    // one_is`, in the oracle). `gate_axes` supplies the contact normal
    // analytically instead, from the operands' own face planes, and keeps the
    // world axes in the set so the measure can only get stricter. See its doc
    // for what happens when an operand is not a box.
    //
    // Two earlier candidates were tried and rejected, both of which tried to
    // recover the direction from the KERNEL'S OUTPUT rather than from the
    // operands: (1) PCA of the wedge's vertex cloud is numerically unstable at
    // the aspect ratios this gate deals with and regressed the already-correct
    // axis-aligned case. (2) The normal of the wedge's largest-area triangle is
    // wrong precisely in the regime this gate exists for: below the near band
    // the kernel returns a genuine WEDGE (module docs above), not a flat slab,
    // so its largest face is not reliably the cap — measured thickness came out
    // over 30x too large on the very cases the oracle pins. Working from the
    // operands' face planes sidesteps the wedge entirely.
    //
    // One more thing the extent must be measured PER, on top of axis: the
    // arrangement can return more than one disjoint overlap component for a
    // single operand pair (e.g. a non-convex operand overlapping the other in
    // two separate places). Pooling `lo`/`hi` across every triangle the
    // kernel returned, regardless of which component it belongs to, was
    // itself a #2573 review finding: two below-band slivers at opposite
    // ends of an operand can each be a genuine coplanar-contact wedge, yet
    // their UNION bounding box spans the operand's full size along every
    // axis and sails past the gate. `component_groups` below partitions
    // `tris` by shared-vertex connectivity (the same bitwise key the welding
    // step already uses) so each disjoint piece is measured against its OWN
