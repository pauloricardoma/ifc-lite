//! The two union entry points, moved out of `csg/mod.rs` (which sits at its
//! module-size budget) so the pair-vs-batch split the #3440 audit needs is
//! visible in one place: `union_pair` does the work and records nothing,
//! `union_mesh` and `union_meshes` each audit — and, under `csg_topology_gate`
//! (step 2), gate — exactly the mesh they return, and only when a boolean
//! actually ran: an empty operand short-circuits both of them past the audit.
