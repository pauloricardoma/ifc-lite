//! Issue #3914: stitch a `consolidate_coplanar` plane-bucket split back
//! together using the kernel's own f64 plane, carried forward as
//! [`crate::mesh::PlaneTag`] by `kernel::mesh_bridge::tris_to_mesh` (the
//! kernel boolean's sole `Mesh` producer).
//!
//! Mechanism: `consolidate_coplanar`'s plane-bucketing step normally keys
//! each triangle by a plane RE-DERIVED from its f32-rounded vertices, which
//! can straddle the `POS_QUANT` rounding boundary for a rotated/tilted face
//! and split one physical plane into two adjacent buckets, each
//! re-triangulated independently — a tear the cross-bucket seam-conform pass
//! (`csg/consolidate/conform.rs`, tangential-only) cannot stitch back
//! together. [`tag_for`] validates each triangle's kernel tag (a
//! supporting-plane check); [`merge_rounding_split_buckets`] then folds
//! together exactly the adjacent-bucket-pair case those tags identify as one
//! kernel plane, leaving every other bucket (the overwhelming majority)
//! untouched.
//!
//! This is deliberately NARROWER than re-deriving every bucket's key from
//! the tag: an earlier, broader attempt (measured, not assumed) regressed
//! two real-model hosts in `triangulation_invariance`
//! (`issue_129_mixed_bool2d_residual_preserves_established_topology`,
//! `issue_4627_candidate_failures_preserve_prior_analytic_cuts`) — real
//! models carry legitimately distinct near-coplanar faces (the same kind the
//! #3913 near-coplanar sweep's `SNAP_GRID` controls exist to keep split),
//! and a blanket re-key cannot reliably tell that apart from a genuine
//! rounding split.

/// the set of surviving bucket keys that absorbed a neighbour (Phase A uses
/// this to know when `tris[0]`'s own recomputed normal is one specific
/// member's noise rather than the shared plane, and to use the tag's
/// normal instead).
///
/// Adjacency in `qpos` (offset differing by exactly one `POS_QUANT` cell) is
/// the geometric signature of a rounding-boundary straddle, and is only the
/// CANDIDATE-PAIR filter (cheap, and it is what limits this pass to
/// neighbours instead of the whole bucket set). The actual #3914-thread
/// discriminator is numeric, not the same coarse `POS_QUANT`/`NORMAL_QUANT`
/// grid the geometric key already uses (that grid is exactly what let the
/// two triangles land in different buckets in the first place, so
/// re-quantizing the tag the same way cannot reliably tell "one plane,
/// rounding-split" apart from "two distinct planes that happen to be
/// adjacent"): every triangle on both sides must carry a validated tag, and
/// those RAW (un-quantized) tags must agree with each other to a tolerance
/// tight against the #3914 thread's measured true-positive margin (kernel
/// planes agreeing to ~1e-10) and well below the #3913 near-coplanar
/// sweep's deliberately distinct `SNAP_GRID` (1/65536 ≈ 1.5e-5) separation,
/// which must NOT merge (that sweep regressed 0 -> 2/882 under
/// quantized-key agreement before this was tightened to raw values).
///
/// SCALE-RELATIVE WITH A HARD CAP (bot review, #3914): like `tag_for`'s
/// tolerance, a fixed absolute value is the wrong order of magnitude on
/// file-unit operands at large coordinates — but UNLIKE `tag_for`, this
/// tolerance is the actual "same plane or not" discriminator, so it cannot
/// simply grow with scale: `SNAP_GRID` is an ABSOLUTE grid in caller-unit
/// space (applied to raw coordinates regardless of magnitude,
/// `mesh_bridge::snap`), so the safety margin against it does not grow with
/// scale either. Capping at `SNAP_GRID / 128` keeps two full orders of
/// magnitude of margin at every scale: below the cap this scales with the
/// triangles' own coordinate magnitude (covers large file-unit models); at
/// or above it, the tolerance saturates and a bucket pair whose f32-cast
/// noise has grown that large simply stops qualifying for the merge —
/// falling back to today's behaviour (never worse), the same structural
/// limit `POS_QUANT` itself is already subject to at extreme coordinate
/// magnitude.
///
/// ADJACENCY-WINDOW SOUNDNESS BOUND: the candidate scan below only ever
/// compares `qpos`-adjacent buckets. That is sound only while a
/// genuinely-split plane's own f32-rederived offset noise, which GROWS with
/// the triangles' coordinate magnitude, stays under one cell; past it, the
/// plane's two rounding-split fragments can land more than one cell apart
/// and this pass would silently miss them (never wrongly merge —
/// `tag_consensus` still gates on the precise tag values — just fail to
/// find the candidate pair at all). `mesh_bridge::SNAP_GRID`'s own doc
/// records the same crossover under a different name: "past |c| = 128
/// CALLER UNITS the f32 spacing is itself a multiple of the grid" — i.e.
/// exactly where this scheme's one-cell adjacency assumption stops holding.
/// Reusing that documented threshold rather than inventing a new one: above
/// it, skip the merge pass entirely (measured: attempting it anyway at
/// 1000x the pinned fixture's scale, in a 3000-case rotated/overlapping
/// sweep, both left 2 pre-existing large-coordinate tears unfixed AND
/// introduced 2 new ones the un-merged output did not have — this guard
/// restores the pre-#3914 large-coordinate behaviour exactly, the same
/// "never worse" contract as an absent `plane_tags`). A full multi-cell
/// scale-aware search is out of scope for this contained fix; flagging
