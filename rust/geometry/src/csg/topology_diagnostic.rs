/// the payload (`router::diagnostics::first_failure_label`, `failuresByReason`,
/// the wasm console breakdown). So a downstream consumer telling this record
/// apart has "KernelError" and nothing else, which holds only while this
/// module stays the sole emitter. Step 2 of #3440, which makes the check gate,
