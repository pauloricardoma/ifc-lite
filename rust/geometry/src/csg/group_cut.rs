//! Group subtraction (disjoint-cutter batching) and the outcome type it shares
//! with the single-cutter `subtract_mesh`.
//!
//! [`GroupCut`] says whether the host was cut and, if not, why, so the router
//! matches on it instead of comparing the returned mesh against the host (the
//! triangle-count and 0.1 % volume decoder of #1788, deleted in #4692).
