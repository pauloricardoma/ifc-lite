//! Split out of `csg_capture.rs` because the revert-oracle classifies a FILE,
//! not a module, and an inline `#[cfg(test)] mod` leaves a branch reading
//! "changes production code and adds NO test file". That only gets past the
//! abort: reverting `csg_capture.rs` still removes the field and the whole
//! crate stops compiling, so this pair can never score OBSERVED. A compile
//! fix behind an off-by-default feature has no runtime observable, and the
//! real guard is the `--all-features` clippy leg in test.yml.

/// #4182 added `Mesh.welded_in_object_frame` and missed this construction
/// site, so `cargo build --all-features` failed on main with `E0063`. No CI
/// leg compiled the `csg_capture` feature, so it merged green.

/// DO NOT replace the literal below with `Mesh::new()`, `placed_box_mesh`, a
/// local `box_mesh` helper, or `..Default::default()`. Every one of them
/// builds a Mesh non-exhaustively, which silently removes the compile break
/// this test exists to create.
///
/// This pins the value rather than only the compile: a future `Mesh` field
/// makes the literal above fail to compile, and this asserts the one the
