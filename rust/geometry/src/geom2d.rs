//! Shared `[f64; 2]` plane primitives: signed ring area, point-in-polygon,
//! line/segment intersection and exact orientation.
//!
//! These lived as private copies inside `space_dcel` (area, point-in-polygon,
//! line intersection, perpendicular distance) and `terrain_cdt` (exact
//! orientation and the closed segment-intersection test). The scan outline
//! tracer (#6871) needs the same set, so they moved here verbatim instead of
//! being copied a third time; both original callers import them from here.
//!
//! The exact `orientation` is also the one `cdt` and `contour_grid_guard`
//! use.
//!
//! Distinct from `bool2d`'s `compute_signed_area` / `point_in_contour`, which
//! take nalgebra `Point2` contours on the IFC profile path.
