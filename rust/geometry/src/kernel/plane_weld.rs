//! Cross-operand near-coincidence promotion, split out of `mesh_bridge.rs`
//! (which sits at its module-size budget) when #3353 made it a boolean-wide
//! concern rather than a subtraction-only one.
//!
//! `mesh_bridge` snaps each operand's coordinates to [`SNAP_GRID`]
//! INDEPENDENTLY, so two faces a user authored flush can land a few µm apart.
//! Everything downstream then has to guess whether they are one surface or
//! two, and the kernel's stages do not guess alike: `broadphase` says "not
//! touching" on exact AABBs, `tritri::near_coplanar` and `classify`'s regime 1
//! both say "flush" on a [`NearBand`]. This module removes the guess at the
//! source by MOVING the vertex onto the plane, which is why it belongs before
//! the arrangement rather than inside the classifier.

/// # Why union needs both directions and subtract does not

/// Subtraction has a natural asymmetry: the host is the thing being cut and
/// must not move, so welding the CUTTER onto it is the whole answer. Union has
/// no such role split. `a ∪ b` and `b ∪ a` are the same solid, but a
/// one-directional weld is keyed to argument POSITION, and on #3353's pinned
/// fixture each direction fixed only its own caller order: welding B onto A
/// left `union_mesh(b, a)` with 8 unmatched directed edges, welding A onto B
/// left `union_mesh(a, b)` with 9. The reconciliation a pair needs is not
/// always in the direction the caller happened to write.
///
/// # Why one pass is not enough
///
/// A single pass in index order welds operand 0 onto the others FIRST, which
/// is the wrong direction for some pairs: pulling an axis-aligned operand's
/// corner onto a rotated operand's tilted plane reconciles that pair and
/// perturbs the mover's own faces at the same time. The following operands
/// then reconcile against the perturbed geometry. A SECOND pass lets the
/// earlier operands re-reconcile against what the later ones settled on, and
/// that is what closes the case one pass opens.
///
/// Only PARTLY, and the limit is invisible from here: [`exact_on_plane_weld`]
/// emits the moved vertex on the 2⁻³⁶ grid while its host gate refuses any
/// triangle off the 2⁻¹⁶ operand grid, so a just-welded triangle is silently
/// REFUSED as a host for the rest of the call. The reverse direction and every
/// later pass reconcile only against faces that did NOT move. That is why this
/// works at all (most faces do not move) and why it is less than the full
/// both-directions reconciliation the name suggests. Lifting it moves welded
/// coordinates, hence the determinism manifests: its own change.
///
/// So passes run until one welds nothing, capped by [`MAX_WELD_PASSES`] — a
/// TERMINATOR, not a safety margin: the weld does NOT reach a fixed point on
/// every input, so iterating to `moved == 0` HANGS. The 80,000-pair hunt and
/// the non-convergent pair it found are recorded on
/// `the_weld_pass_cap_is_load_bearing_because_the_weld_can_oscillate` in
/// `issue_3353_near_coplanar_rotated_overlap.rs`, which pins the cap. Capped
/// cases reach `boolean_with_conformity` only partly reconciled (an output
/// `union_pair` still validates and can fall back on) in exchange for
/// terminating at all.
///
/// # What this does and does not make commutative
///
/// NOT the coordinates: `a ∪ b` may reconcile onto `a`'s plane where `b ∪ a`
/// reconciles onto `b`'s, one snap step away. What it makes commutative is the
/// property that matters — both orders come back CLOSED, with the same volume
/// to within a snap step's worth of surface. That is what
/// `issue_3353_near_coplanar_rotated_overlap.rs` asserts, in both orders.
///
/// # Cost, and the pruning this does NOT do
///
/// A pass is `O(6 · tris_a · tris_b)` plane evaluations, no broadphase in front
/// of it. Union wall time, weld vs the same build with the call removed, on
/// DISJOINT boxes where it cannot move anything: 768 tris each 2.8 → 8.3 ms,
/// 4800 each 39.7 → 571. Quadratic, and blind to whether the operands touch.
/// Deliberate: a per-face AABB reject contradicts the gate being PLANE-level
/// (see [`promote_cutter_verts_onto_host_faces`]), and a whole-operand one is
/// not a no-op either, a plane being infinite. The lever that would work,
/// keying host faces by PLANE, moves which triangle supplies
/// [`exact_on_plane_weld`]'s edge basis — hence welded coordinates, hence the
/// determinism manifests: its own change. Exposure is NOT as narrow as the
/// census (zero unions on AC20-FZK-Haus, ISSUE_129, ISSUE_053, FM_ARC_DigitalHub)
/// suggests: besides an explicit `.UNION.` IfcBooleanResult, `build_cutter_union`

/// against a GROWING accumulator each step — triggered by a budget trip, so on

/// every other kernel stage; wiring it in is deferred, not judged unnecessary.
///

/// The gate is PLANE-level, deliberately NOT footprint-level: in the repro the

/// `near_on_surface_normal`), so welding the vertex onto the plane only
/// removes noise. The CUTTER-ONLY direction suffices and never perturbs the
