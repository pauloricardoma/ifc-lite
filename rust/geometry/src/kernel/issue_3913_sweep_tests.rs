//! Issue #3913: a COMMITTED, deterministic sweep harness for the `union_many`
//! N-ary residual left after the #3912 weld. #3913's own numbers (294 on
//! `main`, 88 after the weld) came from an uncommitted local script — every
//! prior figure in this defect family (#3874's 2090->0 / 2388->0 pairwise
//! sweeps, its prose-only "105 of 147" three-box counts, and #3913's own
//! 294/88) was produced the same throwaway way, so nothing here is
//! reproducible or regression-testable from an earlier PR. This file exists
//! to fix that: every number this file's tests print comes from THIS
//! committed code, run by `cargo test`, forever.
//!
//! ## Shape: reproducing #3913's "441 configurations"
//!
//! #3913 measured a "7x7 corner grid x 3 dz values x 3 operand orderings"
//! sweep over `union_many`. This harness reproduces that shape exactly:
//!
//! - **7x7 corner grid**: `three_boxes_at(bx, by, dz)` below extends
//!   `mesh_bridge_tests::issue_3353_nary_near_coplanar::three_boxes` (the
//!   pinned #3353 N-ary fixture: A axis-aligned at the origin, B rotated +30
//!   degrees about Z overlapping A's +X+Y corner, C rotated -20 degrees
//!   overlapping A's -X+Y corner) by letting B and C's corner offset `(bx,
//!   by)` vary instead of sitting fixed at `(0.4, 0.4)`. `CORNER_OFFSETS`
//!   below is 7 values spanning a shallow-to-deep overlap range, swept on
//!   both axes: 7x7 = 49 corner positions.
//! - **3 dz values**: `DZ_VALUES` samples the exactly-flush case (`dz = 0`,
//!   `three_boxes`'s own control) plus one `SNAP_GRID` step in EACH
//!   direction (`+SG`, `-SG`) — `three_boxes`'s doc names the one-step-off
//!   regime as the one that tears, and sampling both signs (rather than only
//!   `+SG`, which is all the pinned fixture checks) lets the sweep below
//!   answer #3913's "does a `dz` sign correlate with tearing" question
//!   directly, instead of only being able to speculate about the untested
//!   sign.
//! - **6 operand orderings**: `three_boxes_at` returns `[a, b, c]` in a fixed
//!   spatial arrangement; `ORDERINGS` permutes which mesh `union_many` sees
//!   first/second/third. The pinned #3353 fixture checks all 6 permutations
//!   and so does this sweep: `[A,B,C]` (identity), `[A,C,B]`, `[B,A,C]`,
//!   `[B,C,A]`, `[C,A,B]`, and `[C,B,A]` (full reversal). The full set
//!   answers whether the #3912 weld's observed `BCA => 0` is genuinely special
//!   or an artefact of sampling only 3 of 6.
//!   (`promote_operands_mutually` walks operands in index order per
//!   #3912's PR description, so which mesh is index 0 is a plausible axis of
//!   asymmetry, not an arbitrary choice).
//!
//! 7 x 7 x 3 x 6 = 882.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Every configuration is a pure function of its `(bx, by, dz, ordering)`
//! grid indices - no RNG anywhere in this file (unlike
//! `issue_3353_unrecovered_crosstab.rs`'s splitmix64 sweeps). `union_many`
//! and `consolidate_coplanar` are themselves pure functions of their input
//! triangles computed in exact/rational arithmetic (see the kernel's own
//! determinism documentation), so the same 441 configurations produce the
//! same per-configuration tear verdict on every run, on every platform - the
//! same guarantee `mesh_determinism.json` pins for the mesh pipeline at
//! large. No wall-clock, thread count, or memory layout enters the
//! computation.
//!
//! ## CI wiring
//!
//! `union_many_nary_sweep_regression_gate` (below) is NOT `#[ignore]`d: it
//! runs on every `cargo test -p ifc-lite-geometry` / `cargo test --workspace`
//! (measured locally at well under a second for all 441 configurations - see
//! that test's doc comment for the actual timing). A harness nothing runs is
//! exactly the "gate nobody turns" failure `scripts/check-test-wiring.mjs`
//! exists to catch; being fast enough to run by default avoids needing that
//! opt-in at all.
//!
//! ## Verification (this harness actually detects tearing)
//!
//! `open_edges` below is the same "weld by position, count directed edge
//! uses per undirected edge, flag anything other than exactly (1, 1)"
//! convention `issue_3353_nary_near_coplanar::open_edges` and
//! `issue_3353_unrecovered_crosstab.rs::open_edges` already use, so it is not
//! a new, unverified detector - see `csg_property_test.rs`'s
//! `watertight_checker_rejects_non_manifold_and_open_meshes` for the standing
//! proof that this exact check-shape (implemented independently there)
//! rejects both a duplicated-shell false-negative and a plain open mesh.
//! `sweep_self_check_open_edges_detects_known_bad_meshes` below re-proves the
//! same two cases against THIS file's copy directly, since each
//! `issue_3353_*`/`issue_3913_*` file keeps its own copy rather than sharing
//! one (see `issue_3353_unrecovered_crosstab.rs`'s module doc for why no
//! shared sweep-generator module exists in this repo).
