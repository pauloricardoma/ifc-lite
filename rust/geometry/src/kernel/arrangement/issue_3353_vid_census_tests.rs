//! Issue #3353 (`sweep_261`), Vid-space instrument — and, since #4439, the
//! Vid-space health check for the classification-level tear it used to pin.
//!
//! `issue_3353_sweep_261_classification_tear.rs` (a `tests/` integration
//! test, `#[ignore]`d until #4439 because it documented a known-open defect)
//! records that a prior instrumented run found, for this exact operand pair under
//! `Union`: `arr.unrecovered == 0` (the arrangement fully recovers every
//! input constraint — not a missing-constraint failure) alongside a
//! KEPT-triangle set that is non-manifold in pure Vid space, before any
//! float geometry is emitted — the undirected edges `(13,17)` used once and
//! `(14,17)`/`(13,14)` each used three times among the triangles
//! `boolean_vids` decided to KEEP.
//!
//! This module turns that one-off instrumented run into a standing,
//! re-runnable measurement.
//!
//! ## Why this cannot be a `tests/` integration test
//!
//! `boolean_vids`/`boolean_vids_components`/`BComponents` are declared
//! `pub(super) ` in `classify.rs` — visible only inside `kernel::arrangement`
//! (`classify.rs`'s parent module) and its descendants, never outside this
//! crate. Separately, the production entry points
//! (`kernel::mesh_bridge::union`/`boolean`) orient each operand with
//! `kernel::mesh_bridge::orient_outward`, which is `pub(crate)` — also
//! unreachable from an external integration-test crate. Both gaps close for
//! an in-crate `#[cfg(test)]` module, which is why this file is wired in
//! with the same `#[path = "..."] mod ...;` mechanism `classify_tests.rs`
//! already uses (see the bottom of `classify.rs`), rather than living under
//! `rust/geometry/tests/`.
//!
//! ## What this measures
//!
//! For the `sweep_261` operand pair, reproduced via the SAME construction
//! `kernel::mesh_bridge::union` runs internally
//! (`orient_outward(mesh_to_tris(mesh))` on each operand, then `arrange`,
//! then `boolean_vids`) rather than a hand-rolled substitute for either
//! step:
//!
//! 1. The kept-triangle Vid set `boolean_vids` returns, before
//!    `to_f64_pt`/consolidation ever run.
//! 2. An undirected-edge census over those kept triangles in Vid space:
//!    every edge's usage count, and specifically every edge whose count is
//!    not exactly 2 — the Vid-space analogue of the `open_edges` check the
//!    sibling `tests/issue_3353_*` files run on FLOAT geometry, run here one
//!    layer earlier, on the symbolic triangles `boolean_vids` decided to
//!    keep.
//! 3. Per over-used edge, which kept triangles share it and which operand
//!    (A or B) each came from — origin is recovered by exact (unrotated)
//!    membership against `arr.tris_a`/`arr.tris_b`, not by re-deriving
//!    classification (see `origin_of`'s doc comment for why this is valid
//!    for `Union`).
//!
//! ## Which regime decides each implicated triangle (measured)
//!
//! The edge census below says WHICH triangles disagree. This section records
//! WHY, from an instrumented run of `boolean_vids_components`'s own three-regime
//! chain over this exact arrangement. Every triangle on an over-used edge:
//!
//! ```text
//! edge (13,17)   A[17] [15,13,17] |n|=6.11e-1  R3 inside_b=true    keep=false
//!                A[22] [17,13,14] |n|=6.56e-5  R1 dot=1.19e-4      keep=true
//! edge (13,14)   A[15] [13,10,14] |n|=6.01e-6  R3 inside_b=false   keep=true
//!                B[17] [13,39,14] |n|=1.62e-4  R3 inside_a=true    keep=false
//!                B[18] [41,13,14] |n|=3.66e-5  R3 inside_a=false   keep=true
//! edge (14,17)   A[21] [14,11,17] |n|=1.03e0   R3 inside_b=false   keep=true
//!                B[66] [14,39,17] |n|=1.62e0   R3 inside_a=true    keep=false
//!                B[67] [42,14,17] |n|=1.15e0   R3 inside_a=false   keep=true
//! ```
//!
//! The last column is the DECIDING test, so the B rows name the ray cast that
//! actually decided them. `c_on_or_near_a` — the B loop's dedup drop, which runs
//! first — returned false for all four, so none of them reached it.
//!
//! `A[22]` is the whole defect, and it is the ONLY triangle here decided by
//! regime 1. Edge `(13,17)` is bounded by exactly two A sub-triangles, `A[17]`
//! and `A[22]`, and they lie in ONE A face plane — Vids 13, 14, 15 and 17 are
//! exactly coplanar (`orient3d == 0`, not merely within a tolerance), on the
//! plane the original `a[2]` and `a[3]` share as the diagonal split of one box
//! face. Two sub-triangles of one flat face, and they disagree: the well-formed
//! one is dropped as inside B by the ray cast, the needle is kept by the
//! coincident-face regime. Dropping `A[22]` alone repairs all three edges:
//! `(13,17)` goes to 0, since `A[22]` is its only user, and the other two to 2.
//! So it is the single wrong verdict, not a symptom of several.
//!
//! And the ray cast agrees it should be dropped. Probed directly, `A[22]` has
//! `R3 inside_b == true` and `R2 solid_side == (true, true)`: regime 1 is
//! OVERRIDING a fallback that already had the right answer.
//!
//! ## Why regime 1 fires on it, and why that is the root cause
//!
//! `classify.rs`'s `on_surface_tri`/`near_on_surface_tri` establish "this is a
//! coincident SHARED face of the other operand" from the sub-triangle's CENTROID
//! alone: on the other face's plane (or within `NearBand`) and inside its
//! outline. `boolean_vids_components` then resolves that by NORMAL AGREEMENT,
//! `dot3(tri_normal, n_other) > 0.0`.
//!
//! A sub-triangle need not have its parent's plane. Retriangulation can leave
//! one DEGENERATE onto the line where the two parent planes MEET, at which point
//! its whole extent sits within the NEAR band of the other operand's plane
//! however transversal the two faces are. (Measured: the exact
//! `on_surface_normal` returns `None` here; only `near_on_surface_normal`
//! accepts it, at 1.86e-5 off the B face.) `A[22]` is exactly that: a needle whose two ends are
//! 8.4e-5 apart, sitting on the A-B plane intersection line, centroid 1.86e-5
//! from a B face and inside its outline. So regime 1 fires on a face pair that
//! is not coincident, and resolves it by the sign of a cross product a
//! near-collinear triple does not pin down (`|own_n| = 6.56e-5` against
//! `|n_other| = 3.4`). What it happens to yield is `cos = 5.32e-1`, 58 degrees:
//! nowhere near parallel, so there is no shared face to be co-oriented with.
//!
//! ## What was tried against that, and why none of it landed
//!
//! Coincidence is a property of the two INPUT faces, so the natural fix is to
//! ask it of the sub-triangle's PARENT face: carry the originating triangle on
//! the `Arrangement` and require the whole parent to lie on, or be flush within
//! the band of, the candidate face's plane. That is exact, threshold-free, and
//! strictly stricter than the centroid test, so a genuine shared face keeps its
//! verdict. Measured, against a corpus census whose baseline matches the golden
//! exactly:
//!
//! A second shape drops out of the same reading. Only the NEAR test accepts
//! `A[22]`, and `coplanar_a[22] == false`, so gating the A-side near call on the
//! coplanar-parent flag also takes it out of regime 1 — and that is what
//! `near_on_surface_normal`'s own doc claimed the code already did.
//!
//! ```text
//!                                sweep_261   union sweep    census
//! parent-flush, A and B sides    passes      98 -> 72       39 hosts regressed
//! parent-flush, A side only      passes      98 -> 77       20 hosts regressed
//! near test gated on coplanar_a  passes      98 -> 77       20 hosts regressed
//! parent NORMAL for the dot      FAILS       not run        not run
//! flush test on the sub-tri      FAILS       not run        not run
//! parent-flush, A side, 3 verts  passes      98 -> 77       26 regressed, 9 improved
//! needle refused (area < 1e-6 parent) FAILS   98 -> 92       12 regressed, 3 improved
//! ```
//!
//! The last two rows were re-measured on 2026-09-04 with the parent index
//! carried on the `Arrangement` (patches kept off-tree). The all-vertex flush
//! gate fixes the target but also refuses the #1007 tilted-flush caps whose far
//! vertices leave the band: one host doubles its open edges (622 -> 1333) and
//! seven read "geometry lost". The needle gate is scale-free but a 1e-12 cut
//! in |n|^2 misses the very needle in `sweep_261` (its ratio is 3.7e-10), and
//! loosening it to catch that would be tuning a constant on one case. What a
//! fix still needs: a coincidence criterion that is a property of the parent
//! face yet tolerates a tilt of a few um across the face's extent, measured
//! against the corpus golden, with the 26-host row as the first thing to beat.
//!
//! (The two that fail `sweep_261` were not carried further; "not run" is not a
//! null result.)
//!
//! ## What landed (#4439)
//!
//! The eighth shape is none of the above: it is a property of the SUB-TRIANGLE's
//! own plane, not of its parent and not of vertex distances.
//! `arrangement::coincident::coincident_planes` requires the candidate face to
//! be within 45° of parallel to the sub-triangle (`cos² ≥ ½`, evaluated FMA-free
//! on the raw normals) before regime 1 may fire — on the A side and on the
//! B-side dedup drop alike. A genuine shared or flush face has `cos ≈ 1`; `A[22]`
//! above sits at 58° and the #4439 needle at exactly 90°, so both leave regime 1
//! for the ray cast that already had them right. The #1007 flush caps keep their
//! verdict (their snap tilt is < 1e-3 rad), and so do the two
//! `clash_intersection_oracle.rs` near-band invariants, because nothing is
//! gated on `coplanar_a`. Measured: `sweep_261` passes end-to-end (its `tests/`
//! file is no longer `#[ignore]`d) and the census below reads 0 over-used edges
//! of 123. The corpus golden verdict is recorded in the #4439 PR.
//!
//! Why the rows read as they do:
//!
//! 1. The B side must NOT require it. `c_on_or_near_a` is a DEDUP drop, not an
//!    orientation verdict, so making coincidence harder there leaves B copies of
//!    genuinely shared faces alive next to the A copy — the 39-host run's
//!    reasons are dominated by hosts GAINING triangles and open edges.
//! 2. The sliver has to LEAVE regime 1, not be re-oriented inside it: the
//!    parent's normal gives the same sign, so substituting it changes nothing.
//! 3. Gating the near test costs MORE than the census row shows: it also breaks
//!    two pinned near-band invariants in `tests/clash_intersection_oracle.rs`,
//!    `no_surviving_near_band_triangle_has_an_x_facing_normal` and
//!    `the_near_band_shortfall_is_a_missing_face_pair_not_a_shape_dependent_wedge`,
//!    which need that path ungated. So the doc claiming the gate exists is
//!    describing an intent the corpus has since contradicted, not a lost
//!    invariant to restore.
//! 4. Both shapes that fix `sweep_261` improve every aggregate — the A-side
//!    parent-flush one reads corpus unmatched edges 17863 -> 15992, strict-rule
//!    edges 19344 -> 17612, torn hosts 165 -> 161 — while still regressing 20
//!    pinned per-host rows, most of them reading "geometry lost". That is the
//!    per-host golden doing its job: those hosts were watertight BECAUSE regime 1
//!    kept a zero-area sliver on an arbitrary sign, and they have a pre-existing
//!    tear the sliver was patching. Two independent shapes landing on the same
//!    20 is itself evidence the cost is that population, not either criterion.
//!
//! So the remaining work is not another criterion for regime 1. It is the tear
//! those hosts already carry, which today is masked. `various/rvt01.ifc` #7295,
//! #7544, #16805 and `ISSUE_129_...` #34385, #295370, #296868 are the ones that
//! lose the most geometry and are the place to start.
//!
//! ## Deliberately NOT changed
//!
//! No production function's signature, behaviour, or visibility changes.
//! This file only CALLS existing `pub(super)`/`pub(crate)` functions from a
//! new vantage point and post-processes their unmodified return values.
//!
//! ## CI-visible health check (was: a pin of the defective state)
//!
//! `sweep_261_kept_triangles_are_manifold_in_vid_space` (below) runs in normal
//! `cargo test` (no `--ignored`) and asserts the FIXED shape: `unrecovered == 0`
//! together with EVERY kept-triangle edge having Vid-space multiplicity exactly
//! 2. Until #4439 it asserted the opposite — at least one over-used edge, the
//! defect signature above — so that a green tick meant "the defect still
//! reproduces exactly as documented", and a failure was the documented trigger
//! to re-diagnose both files together. That trigger fired: the #4439 gate made
//! the kept set manifold, so the assertion was flipped rather than loosened,
//! together with un-ignoring `sweep_261_overlapping_rotated_union_never_tears`
//! in the sibling `tests/` file (the end-to-end reading of the same case).
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT assert the exact Vid numbers
//! `(13,17)`/`(14,17)`/`(13,14)` — those are Vid-interner allocation labels,
//! not geometry, and pinning them would fail on any relabelling for a reason
//! unrelated to the defect. The assertion stays on the SHAPE.
//!
//! Every number in the regime table above comes from an instrumented run of
//! this exact reproduction at the pre-#4439 code, and the labels matched; the
//! table is kept as the record of WHY regime 1 was wrong, not as a description
//! of current output.
//!
//! The full kept set and edge census are still printed, but CI will NOT show
//! them: `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `cargo test --workspace` with no
//! `--nocapture`, and cargo suppresses stdout for a passing test. To read them:
//!
//!   cargo test -p ifc-lite-geometry --lib issue_3353_vid_census -- --nocapture
//!
//! ## Issue #3915: is this a vertex-IDENTITY defect? (measured, ruled out)
//!
//! #3915 asked whether the interner should be CANONICALIZING near-coincident
//! constraint-intersection vertices during per-face retriangulation, on the
//! theory that this run interns three separate Vids for what should be one
//! shared corner. Instrumented directly (`kernel::interner::Interner::intern`
//! called from THIS reproduction, positions read via `to_f64_pt`), that
//! theory does not hold:
//!
//! ```text
//! Vid 10 = [-1.7237091064453125, -0.3524627685546875, 1.6377716064453125]
//! Vid 11 = [ 1.1296997070312500, -0.3524627685546875, 1.6377716064453125]
//! Vid 13 = [-1.6740500545616240, -0.2988684570207063,  1.6377716064453125]
//! Vid 14 = [-1.6739785390123234, -0.2989121991848813,  1.6377716064453125]
//! Vid 17 = [-0.7426012079060830,  0.0489949180186103,  1.6377716064453125]
//! dist(10,11) = 2.853  dist(10,17) = 1.060  dist(11,17) = 1.915
//! ```
//!
//! Vids 10, 11 and 17 are ordinary A-face vertices, none within a metre of
//! either of the others — not a near-coincident trio. The ONLY near-coincident
//! pair in this arrangement is Vid 13 / Vid 14, 83.85 um apart (matches the
//! issue's own headline measurement exactly), and there are two of them, not
//! three. So there is no third redundant Vid for an intern-time canonical form
//! to fold away.
//!
//! What edge (13,14) actually is: a hairline retriangulation seam on A's
//! face, correctly used by TWO real triangles — `kept[11]=[13,10,14]`
//! (`A[15]`, kept by the ray cast) and `kept[56]=[41,13,14]` (`B[18]`, also
//! kept by the ray cast) — one sliver per operand, each a legitimate
//! consequence of where that operand's OWN retriangulation happened to place
//! its constraint split. Both slivers share the tiny edge because they meet
//! along it; neither vertex is spurious, and merging Vid 13 into Vid 14 (or
//! vice versa) would collapse both real slivers, not remove a duplicate.
//!
//! The edge's multiplicity is 3, not 2, because a THIRD triangle also claims
//! it: `kept[16]=[17,13,14]` (`A[22]`), the needle already named above as
//! "the whole defect" — decided by regime 1 overriding a ray cast (`R3
//! inside_b == true`) that had already rejected it correctly. That is a
//! triangle-ACCEPTANCE defect in `classify.rs`, not a vertex-IDENTITY one:
//! there is no pair of "independently-derived exact intersection points
//! denoting one logical corner" here to canonicalize. Vid 13 and Vid 14 are
//! two distinct, correctly-derived corners; the bug is that a third,
//! wrongly-accepted triangle happens to use the tiny edge between them.
//!
//! The interner itself is exonerated by its own contract (`kernel::interner`
//! module doc): "Two points that are EXACTLY coincident (`cmp_lex == Zero`)
//! get the SAME `Vid`, regardless of construction (LPI vs TPI vs Explicit) or
//! insertion order" — already construction-independent, already exercised by
//! `Interner::tests::coincident_points_weld_to_one_vid` (an LPI and a TPI at
//! the same point weld today). Vid 13 and Vid 14 do NOT collide under that
//! rule because they are not the same exact rational point; inventing a
//! second, coarser identity criterion to fold them together would need a
//! distance threshold, which is exactly the "coincidence criterion" the
//! "What was tried against that" section above already measured — at the
//! classification layer, framed as a parent-plane/parent-flush gate rather
//! than a vertex-merge — and found to regress 20 to 39 golden corpus hosts.
//! Moving the identical threshold decision into the interner does not avoid
//! that cost; it relocates it. No canonicalization is proposed here.

    // candidate face), so it falls to the ray cast. Leaving the old claim in
