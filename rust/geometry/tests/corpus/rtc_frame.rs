//! Match the loader's coordinate-frame choice before producing f32 meshes.
//! Survey coordinates must not become geometry-loss goldens (#3925).
//!
//! The frame is a pure function of the file, so it is derived ONCE per model and
//! reused for every host the sweep walks (#4127). Deriving it per host made each
//! `process()` call walk the whole file twice unconditionally: an entity index
//! over every record, then a second walk calling `has_geometry_by_name` on each
//! to collect the geometry jobs. Placement sampling rides on that second walk and
//! is capped at 50 usable jobs, so it is only a third full pass when nearly every
//! job abstains. If EVERY job abstains, the `scan_placement_bounds` fallback adds
//! two more whole-file walks on top, so the real worst case is five.
//! `triangulation_invariance`
//! makes two of those calls per void host and a third for a torn one, which is
//! what stopped the heavy lane fitting the 60 minutes
//! `.github/workflows/geometry-census-heavy.yml` budgets it (`timeout-minutes: 60`).
//! The before/after timings are in #4127 and in the commit that made this change.
//!
//! # What is still per host, and what is still O(file)
//!
//! ONLY the frame is shared. Every host still gets its own [`GeometryRouter`]
//! and its own [`EntityDecoder`], so the router's mapped-item, dedup,
//! geometry-hash and diagnostic state stays per host exactly as it was. A
//! shared router would carry one host's cached mapped items and its
//! consumed-void bookkeeping into the next host, which is a question about
//! census rows rather than about speed. The two things that ARE shared are pure
//! functions of the content: the entity index (id -> byte span) and the RTC
//! offset.
//!
//! That leaves ONE per-host walk in place, and this note does not claim
//! otherwise: [`ModelFrame::router`] calls `GeometryRouter::with_units`, whose
//! `scan_unit_scale` (`rust/geometry/src/router/mod.rs`) scans entities from the
//! start of the file until it hits `IFCPROJECT`. On most models that stops in
//! the first few KB and costs nothing measurable. On some it does not, because
//! the exporter emitted `IFCPROJECT` last; measured on this corpus:
//!
//! | fixture | first `IFCPROJECT` | file size |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `ara3d/duplex.ifc` | byte 2,380,634 | 2,380,763 |
//! | `ara3d/dental_clinic.ifc` | byte 9,496,389 | 13,003,205 |
//! | `various/01_BIMcollab_Example_ARC.ifc` | byte 6,252,152 (line 100819) | 18,230,149 |
//!
//! All three are in `manifest.json` under `MAX_FIXTURE_BYTES`, so the default
//! sweep walks them, and on those the per-host cost is still effectively
//! O(file).
//!
//! The unit scale is NOT hoisted here, deliberately. It could only be reused by
//! building the per-host router from `GeometryRouter::with_scale_and_rtc`, which
//! unlike `with_units` does NOT call `arm_content_dedup()`. Swapping it in would
//! silently turn item content-dedup off for the census and could move the rows,
//! which is the one thing this change must not do. Hoisting the scale is a
//! separate change that has to argue about dedup, not about speed.
