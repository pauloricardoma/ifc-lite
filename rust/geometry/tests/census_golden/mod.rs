//! Per-host golden for the watertightness census, and the diff that gives its
//! numbers a DIRECTION (#2432).
//!
//! The census used to gate absolute totals over whatever the sweep happened to
//! mesh. Two opposite events moved those totals the same way:
//!
//! 1. an existing mesh got worse — a regression, and
//! 2. an element that previously failed to mesh at all now meshes imperfectly —
//!    an improvement.
//!
//! and one event moved them the *reassuring* way while being the worst of the
//! three: an element that silently stopped meshing takes its own defects out of
//! every total, so coverage loss reads as an improvement.
//!
//! Absolute totals cannot separate those, because nothing in them pins element
//! identity across runs. This module does: one row per swept void host, keyed by
//! `(model, express id)`, checked in and diffed. The cases are then distinct,
//! and the failure message says which one happened.
//!
//! # The key is the manifest-relative PATH, not the basename
//!
//! Three basenames appear twice in the fixture manifest
//! (`basin-tessellation.ifc`, `tessellation-with-individual-colors.ifc`,
//! `column-straight-rectangle-tessellation.ifc`, each under two vendor
//! directories). Keying on the basename would collide their hosts and let one
//! model's row answer for another's.
//!
//! # Models that were not swept are not compared
//!
//! `MIN_MODELS` deliberately sits under the full corpus so a single failed
//! fixture fetch does not red the build. A whole-corpus golden would throw that
//! away: every host of an unfetched model would read as coverage loss. So the
//! diff is scoped to the models this run actually swept, and blessing preserves
//! the rows of the ones it did not. The census prints the models it did not
//! sweep, because that is the one remaining way coverage can leave quietly.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! The census sweeps VOID HOSTS, so this gives coverage-regression detection for
//! those ~1170 elements, not for every product in the corpus. An element with no
//! `IfcRelVoidsElement` that stops meshing is still invisible here. Widening the
//! sweep is a separate, much more expensive change: the ~20-minute run already
//! only processes about one element in a hundred.

/// AND IT DOES NOT COVER ONE FLIPPED VERTEX, which the paragraph above is

/// shift from moving one vertex by one grid step is the incident triangle area
/// times the step over three, so it grows with the FACE, not with the host's

        // `r.collapsed` disqualifies; the watertight arm added below routes on
        // the VOLUME and never consults it, so `open 0 -> 0` with fewer
        // triangles at unchanged volume fills `worse_counts` ("gained
        // snap-collapsed triangles") and `c.retessellated` at the same time.
        // The verdict is unaffected — a worsened count outranks — but the
        // shrink reason has to ride along, which is what this paragraph is
        // about. `better` rides along for the same reason and not as good
        // news: the shrink reason SAYS "less torn", and the open-edge numbers
        // are the only thing in the output that lets a reviewer check it.
        //
        // A reclassification then outranks the DERIVED `is_torn_solid` flip,
        // because a host relabelled `SurfaceModel -> CSG` joins the gated defect
        // population without a single one of its counts moving, and that is a
        // change of question, not a degradation.
        //
        // A gated flip is never the DECIDING signal, though, so no arm of this
        // chain is keyed on `worse_gated` alone — #3396 deleted the one that
        // was, and it sat right here, between the reclassification and the
        // re-tessellation. `is_torn_solid` reads exactly `open`, `rep`, `far`
        // and `pre`. Suppose it flips with `reclassifications` empty: then
        // `rep`, `far` and `pre` are equal on both sides (#3366 carries all
        // three), so the three non-count clauses read the same for `g` and `r`,
        // and only `open` can have moved — `g.open == 0` with `r.open > 0`,
        // which is `r.open > g.open`, which fires `worse_counts` and takes the
        // first branch. So every route in is claimed by one of the two branches
        // above, which is also why those two are the only ones carrying
        // `worse_gated` in their reasons: a flip cannot reach `retessellated`
        // or `improved`, so listing it there would be the same dead arm written
        // as a dead concat. Deleting the branch is therefore not a demotion of
        // the signal: it stays in the text either way, and both buckets that
        // can carry it are red and require a bless. Reordering it ABOVE the
        // reclassification would be the real change of meaning, filing a pure
        // relabel as a geometry regression — the misattribution #3366 landed to
        // stop, pinned by the reclassification tests below.
        //
        // A volume move (#3422) sits under the reclassification and above the
        // re-tessellation. Under, because both are "review, then re-bless"
        // verdicts and a relabel changes what the volume is a volume OF; above,
        // because a shrink at unchanged volume is the friendly reading and a
        // shrink with the volume moving is not. The two lists are NOT
        // exclusive, and the order is what decides between them: a SIGN FLIP at
        // equal magnitude fills both, since `volume_moved` is read on the
        // signed integer and the shrink's routing on the magnitude, so
        // `55000 -> -55000` with fewer triangles is "winding inverted" AND
        // "enclosed volume unchanged". Filing it as a volume move is the right

        // the named unit tests rather than by that invariant.

        // true a few lines later in the same commit.
        //
        // What it adds to the CHECKED population is NOT what the obvious reading
        // suggests: growth pairs already existed at `[0, 5]` via `0 -> 5`, and
        // no shrink is ever checked, because every shrink requires a bless. The
