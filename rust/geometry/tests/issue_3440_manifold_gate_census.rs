//! #3440 step 3 measurement: how many hosts across the fixture corpus does the
//! edge-multiplicity gate (`manifold_gate_reject`) actually REJECT?
//!
//! This is the flip-set measurement the issue demands before a gate changes
//! behaviour. It says the gate is cheap to ship - 110 of 2071 hosts reject and
//! all 110 are still cut by a downstream fallback - and that reading is what
//! made the gate look safe to turn on by default. It is not sufficient:
//! "still cut" is not "cut as well", and this repo's pinned quality fixtures
//! say the fallback is worse than the tear. See `csg_manifold_gate` in
//! `Cargo.toml` for the numbers. Keep that in mind before reading the count
//! below as a green light.
//!
//! Needs the `csg_manifold_gate` feature (this file compiles to an empty,
//! trivially-passing binary without it), and is `#[ignore]`d because it also
//! needs the fixture corpus, which `cargo test --workspace` does not have on a
//! clean checkout — an assertion over an
//! empty corpus would measure nothing while reading green. Fetch the corpus
//! (`node scripts/fixtures/fetch-fixtures.mjs`) and run:
//!
//!   cargo test -p ifc-lite-geometry --features csg_manifold_gate \
//!     --test issue_3440_manifold_gate_census -- --ignored --nocapture
