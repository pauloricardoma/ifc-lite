//! Issue #098: a DENSER instance of the same Poroton wall type as the sibling
//! `issue_098_reveal_wall` test — `IfcWallStandardCase` #1512699,
//! `3FceP9AqX1_92g5eDdrV5C` — whose 7 `IfcFacetedBrep` stepped-reveal window
//! openings batch onto ONE wall face. The dense near-collinear reveal cluster
//! defeats the incremental constraint recovery (earcut can only fan it into
//! sliver tips); the Sloan traversal fallback + volume-safe batched difference
//! bring it from ~2072 open edges (badly torn) to ~108 with the removed volume
//! unchanged. This fixture is the wall isolated WITH its voids by
//! `ifc-lite extract-entities`.

// A SECOND, denser instance of the same Poroton Ventilata wall type as
// `issue_098_reveal_wall` (wall W): #1512699 / `3FceP9AqX1_92g5eDdrV5C`, 7 faceted-
// BREP splayed-reveal windows batched onto ONE face. Its dense CDT leaves a few
// constraints the boundary-walk recovery can't force; the Sloan ordered-traversal
// fallback recovers most, and the volume-safe batched-difference accept keeps the
// exact (cleaner) batched cut instead of the sequential re-jitter. Together with
// the off-plane fix this brings the wall from ~2072 open edges (badly torn) to
// ~108 with the removed volume unchanged. Guard against regression past that.
// #3440/#3871: under an accept gate (`csg_manifold_gate`, `csg_topology_gate`)
// the boolean accept seam REJECTS a kernel result carrying a torn or
// non-manifold edge, and the router falls back. On this fixture that fallback
// is measurably WORSE than the tear it replaces, which is precisely why both
// features are off by default. Where it regresses, the assertion below is not
// relaxed - it is REPLACED by the measured value, so the gated build stays
// green while still failing the moment the number moves in either direction.
// The thing to fix is the FALLBACK path (the #635 AABB box-cut the void router
// reaches when the exact cut is discarded), not the bar; when it is fixed,
// these pins should go and the default bar apply to every build.
//
// The two gates read different defect classes and reject different hosts, so
// each combination is measured separately rather than assumed. `None` means
// the real bar still holds in that configuration and is left to do its job.
// #4640 made `csg_topology_gate` alone converge on the default result (92
// unpaired edges and 33.399 m3), so that configuration no longer carries a
// known fallback regression or a pin. The manifold-gated configurations still
// take the measured worse fallback and remain pinned below.
