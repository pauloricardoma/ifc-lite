//! #4067 behavioral reproduction: CSG diagnostic counts depend on cache
//! execution order.
//!
//! `ItemDedupCache` (the "structural boolean cache" #4067 names) stores only
//! `(Mesh, Option<u128>)` — see `rust/geometry/src/router/mod.rs`'s
//! `ItemDedupCache` alias and `router/processing.rs`'s
//! `process_representation_item` — never the `BoolFailure` diagnostics the
//! uncached (MISS) build recorded via `record_topology_tear`
//! (`csg/topology_diagnostic.rs`). A cache HIT for the same structural item
//! therefore returns byte-identical geometry while silently omitting the
//! diagnostic the first build recorded.
//!
//! `WALL_WITH_OPEN_UNION` below is a real, parsed `IfcWall` whose Body item is
//! `IFCBOOLEANRESULT(.UNION., openFacetedBrep, extrudedBox)`, where
//! `openFacetedBrep` is a unit cube missing its top face (5 of 6 faces) — a
//! deliberately malformed but syntactically valid `IfcFacetedBrep`, the same
//! shape `csg/csg_tests.rs`'s in-code `open_box_mesh` fixture uses, expressed
//! as real IFC text so it goes through the router's actual
//! `process_representation_item` / `ItemDedupCache` path rather than calling
//! `ClippingProcessor::union_meshes` directly. Its union with the overlapping
//! box leaves the 4 edges bordering the missing face unmatched, so
//! `validate_mesh` (finite + in-bounds only — no closure check) accepts the
//! result and `record_topology_tear` records a `KernelError` for it.
