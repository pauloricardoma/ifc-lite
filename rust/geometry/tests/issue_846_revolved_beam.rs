//! Regression test for issue #846 — IfcBeam #227 in the
//! beam-varying-extrusion-paths fixture uses an IfcRevolvedAreaSolid that
//! references a non-trivial Position offset (0, -100, 0) and a revolution
//! axis at (-1300, 100, 0) with direction (0,-1,0). The old processor
//! (a) ignored the IfcSweptAreaSolid Position transform and (b) misused the
//! 2D profile (x,y) coords as (radius, height) along the axis. The result
//! was a tiny ring near the axis location instead of the expected 45° arc
//! sweep of an IPE200 profile around the axis line.
