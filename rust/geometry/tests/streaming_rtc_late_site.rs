//! Regression for georeferenced jitter (ISSUE_129). The world offset lives in
//! spatial-structure placements emitted LATE in the file (IfcSite at line
//! 202 339 of a 202 691 line model). `buildPrePassStreaming` emits its RTC meta
//! as soon as `META_EMIT_JOBS` (50) geometry jobs are buffered — near the
//! TOP of the file — using the partial entity index built so far. At that point
//! the element -> storey -> building -> site placement chain can't resolve, so
//! detection returns (0,0,0), `needsShift=false`, and the ~8e6 m coordinates are
//! cast to f32 downstream (~0.5 m jitter). The browser confirmed this:
//! `[stream] meta unitScale=1 rtc=[0,0,0]` for this model.
//!
//! This pins the mechanism the streaming fix relies on: at the meta-emit cut
//! point the *partial* index MISSES the offset (reproducing the bug), while a
//! *full* index recovers it (the fallback `gpu_meshes.rs` now performs when no
//! offset is found and the IfcSite hasn't been scanned yet).
