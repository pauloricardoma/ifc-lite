//! Is the pipeline invariant to the triangulator's DIAGONAL CHOICE?
//!
//! Ear-clipping picks interior diagonals by a heuristic. For a given polygon
//! many diagonal sets are equally valid: same boundary edges, same total area,
//! same triangle count, no overlap, no degenerate triangles. Nothing downstream
//! is entitled to depend on which one it gets. Where something does, output
//! watertightness is accidental, and any triangulator change, version bump or
//! fast-path refactor can silently tear geometry.
//!
//! The measurement: process every void-hosting element twice, once through each
//! of two independent ear-clippers, and compare open boundary edges. The second
//! triangulator lives behind the `triangulation-alt` feature and is selected at
//! run time by `IFCLITE_TRIANGULATION_ALT`.
//!
//! Run:
//!   cargo test -p ifc-lite-geometry --features triangulation-alt \
//!     --test triangulation_invariance -- --nocapture
//!
//! Without the feature the test reports that it was skipped and passes, so the
//! default `cargo test` stays fast. The golden's own unit tests in
//! [`census_golden`] do NOT need the feature and run in the default suite.
//!
//! # What gates this, and why it is no longer a set of constants
//!
//! It used to be five pinned `BASELINE_*` ceilings over absolute corpus totals.
//! Those totals count defects across whatever the sweep actually meshed, so they
//! could not tell an existing mesh getting worse from an element that had never
//! meshed at all now meshing imperfectly — and they moved the *reassuring* way
//! when an element silently stopped meshing, because its defects left every sum
//! with it. Re-baselining was therefore indistinguishable from covering up.
//!
//! The gate is now a checked-in per-host golden (#2432): one row per swept void
//! host, keyed by `(manifest-relative path, express id)`. Regressions, coverage
//! losses, additions, reclassifications and re-tessellations are separate
//! outcomes with separate messages, and the corpus totals are DERIVED from the
//! golden rather than hand-edited, so there is no constant left to bump.
//! `MIN_MODELS` / `MIN_VOID_HOSTS` remain as the floor: every other check is an
//! upper bound, so without them an unpopulated tree satisfies all of them
//! vacuously.
//!
//! Every run also writes the rows it measured to [`RUN_REPORT_PATH`], which CI
//! uploads as an artifact, so re-blessing does not require reproducing the sweep
//! on the machine that disagreed. Re-blessing IN CI is refused outright (see
//! [`census_golden::bless_mode`]): the bless path returns before every check, so
//! a leaked `IFCLITE_CENSUS_BLESS` would leave the lane permanently and silently
//! green, which is worse than a lane that reports a problem.
//!
//! # The heavy lane (#3434)
//!
//! [`MAX_FIXTURE_BYTES`] filters `discover_models()` BEFORE any file is opened,
//! so an oversized fixture is not merely un-pinned in the golden above — the
//! sweep never reads it at all. Two `ara3d` fixtures are excluded that way:
//! `ISSUE_053_20181220Holter_Tower_10.ifc` (169 MB) and
//! `ISSUE_068_ARK_NUS_skolebygg.ifc` (54 MB). AGENTS.md's perf section already
//! names this exact class as the one where "every shipped regression has
//! lived", and the census instrument did not touch it either. Per-PR CI still
//! does not, deliberately: this lane is weekly, and AGENTS.md is worded to say
//! per-PR rather than to advertise a gate list it tells you not to trust.
//!
//! [`heavy_fixture_issue_053_is_watertight`] and
//! [`heavy_fixture_issue_068_carries_the_known_3435_tear`], near the bottom of
//! this file, reach the two fixtures directly (bypassing `discover_models`'s
//! size filter, not raising [`MAX_FIXTURE_BYTES`] itself) and run the SAME
//! per-host walk via [`sweep`], gated through the SAME [`census_golden`]
//! machinery as the main corpus, against one shared golden,
//! [`HEAVY_GOLDEN_PATH`].
//!
//! ## What runs it
//!
//! `.github/workflows/geometry-census-heavy.yml`: weekly, plus
//! `workflow_dispatch` before a kernel-sensitive merge. Both tests are
//! `#[ignore]`d so neither `cargo test --workspace` nor the per-PR census job
//! pays for 223 MiB of fixture; `-- --ignored heavy_fixture` matches both and is
//! what that workflow runs.
//!
//! Wiring it is the whole of #3434. #3436 added these two tests and nothing
//! ran them: no workflow step, no script, no `--ignored` anywhere under
//! `.github/` or `scripts/`, so [`HEAVY_GOLDEN_PATH`] was a ratchet nobody
//! turned. AGENTS.md states the rule for `scripts/` gates — "a guard nothing
//! runs is the same absence as a guard that finds nothing" — and an `#[ignore]`
//! no `--ignored` ever reaches is the same shape in Rust.
//!
//! ## Why the known tear is IN the golden
//!
//! ISSUE_068 is torn, and #3436 pinned the CORRECT end state (`torn == 0`)
//! instead of recording the tear, so the test failed on every run by design.
//! Nothing can be wired to that: a lane that is red whatever happens carries
//! one bit and it is always the same bit. `assert_eq!(torn, 0)` reads
//! identically at today's torn population and at ten times it on an entirely
//! different set of hosts, so it cannot separate the KNOWN tear from a NEW
//! one — which is the only question a standing lane is there to answer.
//!
//! The tear is therefore pinned PER HOST in [`HEAVY_GOLDEN_PATH`], exactly as
//! the main corpus already pins its own torn hosts. The golden is a per-host
//! CEILING, so a tear on a host that was clean files under `regressed`, a host
//! that stops meshing under `missing`, a host absent from the golden under
//! `added`, and every one of those is red.
//!
//! Recording it is not blessing it away, because the POPULATION is pinned
//! separately as [`ISSUE_068_KNOWN_TORN_HOSTS`] and checked against the
//! checked-in golden by
//! [`the_heavy_golden_pins_the_known_3435_tear_population`] — which reads the
//! file with `include_str!`, needs no fixture and no sweep, and therefore runs
//! in the default `cargo test --workspace` on every PR. Moving that population
//! in EITHER direction reds that test until someone edits a constant whose name
//! says #3435. A fix has to lower it deliberately; a regression cannot raise it
//! quietly.
//!
//! ## Why no counts are written in this section
//!
//! #3436's prose here said ISSUE_068 measured 29 torn hosts / 285 open edges,
//! a doc comment beside it said 27/274, and by the time anything ran either
//! one neither was true: swept at `6f445b6f2` the fixture reads 363 void hosts,
//! 28 torn, 282 open edges, and its worst host `#43810` carries 40 open edges
//! rather than the 42 recorded next to it. No geometry work targeted this
//! fixture in between and no reader could have known any of that, because
//! nothing re-derived it. The counts now live in the golden and in one named
//! constant, both of which a test reads; the figures in this paragraph are
//! dated on purpose, as history rather than as a claim about `main`.

/// GATE 1, invariance: does watertightness depend on the triangulator's

/// and the corpus ceilings.
///
/// The gates overlap rather than partition. The golden's COUNT columns
/// (open, strict, tris, collapsed) are production-triangulator readings,
/// but it also pins each host's `alt` column, so `classify` can push
/// "newly depends on the triangulator's diagonal choice" into the same
/// `worse_counts` that feeds `diff.regressed`. A REGRESSED failure is

/// `non-invariant` printed identically before and after (140 vs 140 -- the
/// triangulators still agreed exactly) and were called invariance failures
/// for hours because of it (#3353). The three asserts that can be reached
