//! Issue #3353: a CLASSIFICATION-level boolean tear on an overlapping,
//! rotated operand pair — distinct from the consolidation-level tear
//! `issue_3353_boolean_tear.rs` (PR #3388) pins.
//!
//! This case (`sweep_261`) was recovered from
//! `upstream/fix-3353-boolean-tearing`
//! (`rust/geometry/tests/issue_3353_rotated_overlap_tearing.rs`, PR #3373,
//! now closed) — its operands were never committed to `main`, so
//! classification-level work on #3353 could not previously be judged by any
//! test in this repo.
//!
//! ## Why this is classification-level, not consolidation-level
//!
//! `issue_3353_boolean_tear.rs` pins a tear that `consolidate_coplanar`
//! (`rust/geometry/src/csg/consolidate.rs`) INTRODUCES on top of a raw
//! kernel output that was already watertight. `sweep_261` is different: the
//! raw kernel output (`kernel::mesh_bridge::union`) is ALREADY
//! non-manifold, and `consolidate_coplanar` is a byte-identical no-op on
//! it — confirmed directly against the crate's private `consolidate_coplanar`
//! and `kernel::mesh_bridge::union`:
//!
//! ```text
//! raw_positions=747 raw_indices=249 cons_positions=747 cons_indices=249
//! positions_eq=true indices_eq=true
//! raw_open=3 cons_open=3
//! public_union_open_edges=3
//! ```
//!
//! i.e. `consolidate_coplanar(raw.clone())` returns a mesh whose `positions`
//! and `indices` vectors are EQUAL, element-for-element, to `raw`'s — it
//! never runs a re-triangulation pass on this input at all (or its output
//! happens to be identical), so it cannot be the source of the tear. The
//! defect is upstream, in the exact arrangement's classification step
//! (`rust/geometry/src/kernel/arrangement/classify.rs`): a prior
//! instrumented run recorded `arr.unrecovered == 0` (the arrangement
//! recovers every input triangle — this is NOT a missing-constraint
//! failure) alongside non-manifold SYMBOLIC edges in pure Vid-space, before
//! any float geometry is emitted:
//! `[((13,17),1), ((14,17),3), ((13,14),3)]` — i.e. the classification
//! verdict itself keeps an edge used once, and another used three times,
//! among the *kept* triangles, independent of position/consolidation.
//!
//! A recent attempt at #3353 was mis-scoped against `issue_3353_boolean_tear`
//! precisely because no classification-level fixture existed in the repo:
//! instrumentation on that test showed `a_hits=0, b_hits=0` — the
//! coincident-face classification regime this case exercises never fires
//! there.
//!
//! ## Not fixed by the #3353 near-coplanar weld, and what is left
//!
//! `issue_3353_near_coplanar_rotated_overlap.rs` fixed the half of #3353 where
//! two operand faces land a few `SNAP_GRID` steps apart because `mesh_bridge`
//! snaps per axis: `union_with_conformity` now welds the operands onto shared
//! planes before the arrangement, which closed a 9464-union sweep of the
//! rotated corner-overlap family.
//!
//! `sweep_261` is only PARTLY that. With the weld in place its Union still
//! reports 3 unmatched directed edges, unchanged. Disabling the weld entirely
//! leaves the committed 8000-pair union sweep at exactly 98 torn — measured on
//! the issue, not here — so the residual is outside the weld's reach.
//!
//! ## The mechanism, and where it is written up
//!
//! The residual is `rust/geometry/src/kernel/arrangement/classify.rs`'s regime 1
//! — the coincident-shared-face test — firing on a face pair that is not
//! coincident. It establishes coincidence from a sub-triangle's CENTROID alone,
//! and a sub-triangle need not have its parent's plane: retriangulation can leave
//! one degenerate onto the LINE where the two parent planes meet, at which point
//! every one of its points lies in the other operand's plane however transversal
//! the faces are. Here that is `arr.tris_a[22] = [17, 13, 14]`, kept by regime 1
//! while its own neighbour in the same A face plane, `arr.tris_a[17]`, is
//! correctly dropped as inside B. That leaves three Vid-space edges at the wrong
//! multiplicity, and dropping `tris_a[22]` alone repairs all three: `(13,17)`
//! goes to 0 (it was used once, by that triangle only) and the other two to 2.
//! Measured in Vid space, one layer above the float `open_edges` below.
//!
//! `kernel/arrangement/issue_3353_vid_census_tests.rs` is where this is written
//! up: the per-triangle regime table for every triangle on an over-used edge,
//! the measurements behind the paragraph above, and the seven fix shapes tried
//! against it — including why the two that fix this test each cost 20 golden
//! census hosts. Read it before attempting an eighth.
//!
//! One correction to record here, because it is this file's own earlier reading:
//! the "84 um IN-PLANE vertex split" to be healed by a coplanar-overlay /
//! retriangulation chord divergence is the same two vertices seen from the other
//! end, but it points at the wrong repair. The vertices are exact and
//! independently derived (measured on the issue), and nothing merges them. What
//! goes wrong is the verdict taken on the sliver they span.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Fixed by #4439 (`kernel::arrangement::coincident::coincident_planes`):
//! regime 1 of the classifier now requires the sub-triangle's OWN plane to be
//! within 45° of the face its centroid was found near, so the 84 µm needle on
//! the A/B plane-intersection line — 58° off the B face it was being taken
//! for a coincident copy of — falls through to the ray cast, which already
//! classified it as inside B. Un-ignored with that change; this test is the
//! end-to-end reading of the case and
//! `kernel/arrangement/issue_3353_vid_census_tests.rs` the Vid-space one.
//! It failed for the stated reason (3 unmatched directed edges) when run with
//! `--ignored` immediately before this change. The consolidation-level half of #3353
//! (`issue_3353_boolean_tear.rs`) is unaffected and still `#[ignore]`d.
//!
