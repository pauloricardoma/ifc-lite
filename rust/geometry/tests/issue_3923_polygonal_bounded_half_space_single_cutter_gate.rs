//! Issue #3923 — `apply_boolean_step`'s single-cutter
//! `IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace` branch (the sibling of #3919/#3922's
//! `try_union_polygonal_chain` chain path) must not accept an accept-gate
//! rejected subtract as a real clip.
//!
//! Self-contained (no external fixture): the host is a hand-authored
//! `IfcFacetedBrep` box missing its top face — the same "open box" shape
//! `open_box_mesh` in `rust/geometry/src/csg/csg_tests.rs` uses to trip
//! `csg_topology_gate` / `csg_manifold_gate` — cut by a single
//! `IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace` whose bounded prism spans from the box's
//! mid-height straight through the missing top face. `try_union_polygonal_chain`
//! only batches chains of 2+ PBHS cutters (see its doc comment: "Returns
//! `Ok(None)` ... when the chain has fewer than two PBHS cutters"), so this
//! single cutter reaches `apply_boolean_step`'s own branch, not the path
//! #3922 already hardened.
//!
//! Under a gate, the kernel's subtract of the closed prism from the open host
//! is rejected (open/non-manifold input), and `subtract_mesh` hands back the
//! host UN-CUT — the identical shape it returns for "nothing to cut here" —
//! which `difference_result_looks_degenerate` cannot tell apart (an unchanged
//! mesh is trivially a subset of itself). Pre-fix, that un-cut host was
//! accepted as the final clip result; post-fix it must fall through to the
//! branch's own `clip_mesh_with_half_space` fallback, which DOES remove the
//! upper half (a strict superset of the intended bounded cut, but a real cut,
//! not a silent no-op).
