/**
 * Test-only loader hook for `collabSlice.leave-during-join-race.test.ts`.
 *
 * Registered via `node:module`'s `register()` from inside that one test
 * file, so it only affects that file's (isolated, per-file) process — it
 * does not touch the shared `vite-module-hooks` pipeline other suites rely
 * on, and it does not change what `@ifc-lite/collab` exports for anything
 * else.
 *
 * Wraps `createCollabSession` so the test can pause the REAL session's
 * `whenSynced` at a chosen point (after the real IndexedDB/CRDT bring-up
 * has actually happened) and resume it on demand — the deterministic
 * substitute for "the network happened to take a while". Every other
 * export passes through untouched.

/**
 * Match on the RESOLVED URL, not the bare specifier.
 *
 * Matching `specifier === '@ifc-lite/collab'` looked equivalent and was not.
 * `module.registerHooks` (synchronous, in-thread) landed in Node 22.15.0, and
 * tsx feature-detects it: on a newer 22 it resolves through the sync path,
 * which normalises the bare specifier to a `file://` URL BEFORE this async
 * `register()` hook is consulted. The exact-match then misses, nothing is
 * wrapped, `__collabSessionGated` never fires, and the test waits forever.
 *
 * That is why this passed on a developer machine and hung on CI: the workflow
 * pins `node-version: 22`, which floats to the newest 22.x, so the two were
 * never running the same loader architecture. Reproduced by running this file
 * on 22.14.0 (passes, 0.35s) and 22.23.2 (hangs, `testTimeoutFailure`).
 *
 * The `parentURL` guard is load-bearing rather than defensive: the wrapper
 * module below imports the REAL url, so URL-matching without it would wrap the
 * wrapper, forever.
