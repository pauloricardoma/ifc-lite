/**
 * Test-only `Worker` stand-in that runs the real overlay-parse handler
 * in-process (#2183).
 *
 * Node has no `Worker`, so `parseOverlayLines` / `parseSymbolicFlat` /
 * `parseProfilesFlat` resolve empty there by design — a model must still load
 * (and still draw, without projection) when the worker cannot
 * start. That is right for production but it silently guts any test that
 * drives a hook end-to-end and expects real parsed content.
 *
 * A stub returning canned data would test nothing. This runs the ACTUAL
 * `handle()` from the worker module and passes the reply through
 * `structuredClone`, so the flatten, the transferable layout and the
 * main-side reassembly are all genuinely exercised — the same boundary a real
 * `postMessage` imposes.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a production fallback: adding one would reintroduce the
 * main-thread WASM heap this whole change exists to remove, on exactly the
 * flaky machines where the worker fails to start.
