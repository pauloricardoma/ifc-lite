/**
 * `extract-classname.ts`'s own doc comment says it throws, rather than
 * silently matching nothing, "if the class ever becomes a template
 * literal or a `cn(...)` call" — true before this test existed, but
 * over-broad: a template literal whose class tokens are all literal text
 * (no `${...}` expression at all) is just as statically readable as a
 * plain quoted string, and CI's own #4825 follow-up wants to measure a
 * translucent surface's className that happens to be written with
 * backticks for no functional reason. This file locks in the narrower,
 * intended boundary: a LITERAL-ONLY template literal is now extracted like
 * any other className string; a template literal that actually
 * INTERPOLATES (any `${...}`) still throws loudly — extending the boundary
 * to "not runtime-interpolated" rather than "not a template literal at
 * all", while preserving the property the doc comment cares about: this
 * never silently returns a partial or best-guess string for a value it
 * cannot fully resolve statically.
