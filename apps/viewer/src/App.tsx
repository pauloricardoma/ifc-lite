// entry's static import graph, so `/` preloaded three.js (~140 KB br) and the
// marketing chunks on every first paint. Loading these two roots lazily moves
// three.js + the marketing code into their own async chunks, off the `/`
// critical path. ViewerLayout stays static — it IS the `/` route, so keeping it
