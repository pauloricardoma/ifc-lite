/**
 * Jumping to a favourite, mounted under `<StrictMode>` because that is where
 * it broke.
 *
 * The browser is a three-step wizard, so a favourite has to rebuild the state
 * the user would have reached by hand and then wait a render for the id-only
 * listing it requested. The first version of that fired once, guarded by a ref
 * — and StrictMode's mount runs effect -> cleanup -> effect, while both
 * `useSourceCatalogSync` and `usePagedList` abort their in-flight request and
 * bump their request generation in their own unmount cleanups. So the listing
 * the first pass started was aborted by the teardown in between, the second
 * pass skipped (ref already set), and because the generation was now stale the
 * `finally` that clears `loadingFolders`/`loadingFiles` no longer applied: two
 * spinners, forever, with no request outstanding. Every test here therefore
 * renders inside `<StrictMode>` — under a plain mount they pass either way.
 *
 * The provider fixture mirrors Dalux (`flat-subtree` + recursive files), which
 * is the shipped capability pair this ran into. A second fixture mirrors
 * Dropbox/msgraph (`direct-children` + per-folder files), whose two-step
 * `openContainer` is the only way to reach the folders-before-files window one
 * of the tests pins down. A third splits the FOLDER listing over two pages,
 * which is what the folder branch's paging guard exists for.
