/**
 * What the sheet will be, and the two ways it can be wrong: the page readout,
 * the oversize block, and the perspective-camera notice for the 3D-view PDF
 * dialog (#2042).
 *
 * Split out of `PdfViewExportDialog` when the appearance controls landed, so
 * the dialog stays a composition of named sections rather than one long body.
 * Every string here is a NUMBER the user is expected to act on, which is why
 * none of them is a generic "check your settings": an unprintable page names
 * the limit it broke, and the perspective notice offers the camera switch
 * rather than silently changing the user's view.

              The PDF is an orthographic (parallel) projection along your current view
              direction, so near and far objects print at the same scale. That is the only
              way a printed drawing can carry a single scale. Switch to orthographic to
              see the same parallel projection on screen.
