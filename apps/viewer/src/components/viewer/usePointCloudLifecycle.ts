/**
 * Tear down streamed point cloud GPU resources when a model is removed.
 *
 * Streamed assets (LAS/LAZ) live in a separate ownership bucket on the
 * renderer (see `PointCloudRenderer`'s `'streamed'` owner tag), so they
 * survive `setPointClouds` calls. That isolation cuts both ways: nothing
 * else clears them, so when a model is removed we have to do it here or
 * the GPU buffers leak for the rest of the session.
 *
 * The hook tracks the previous set of `(modelId → handleId)` pairs and,
 * on every model change, frees handles for disappeared models while mirroring
 * model visibility onto resident streamed assets.
