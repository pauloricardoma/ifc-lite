/**
 * useCostModels — live per-model cost graphs for the Cost panel (#4858).
 *
 * Consumes the SAME `createCostAdapter` surface `bim.cost` scripting uses
 * (`apps/viewer/src/sdk/adapters/cost-adapter.ts`, from the merged #4867) —
 * no cost arithmetic is re-implemented here.
 *
 * `graph: null` and `graph.HasCostData === false` are DIFFERENT states,
 * both surfaced to the caller rather than collapsed:
 *   - `null` — this model has no loaded IFC source bytes to read cost from
 *     (a GLB/point-cloud/IFCX-only load, or extraction genuinely failed).
 *     `error` names why when available.
 *   - `HasCostData: false` — the source WAS read and genuinely has no
 *     `IfcCostItem`/`IfcCostSchedule` data (the "empty" state, #4858).
 *
 * Recomputes from the store's live `models` Map on every render where that
 * Map's identity changed — so removing or replacing a model (teardown)
 * naturally drops its entry with no stale reference to clean up here; the
 * effort was `buildLoadReports` (`lib/loadReport.ts`) already established
 * for the same "no store or cache retained per-model" precedent.
