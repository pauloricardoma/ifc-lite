/**
 * Header action buttons for the selected entity (Properties panel "info tab"):
 * Zoom to, Hide/Show, and Show in context (ghost).
 *
 * "Show in context" answers #3618: from an Entity List row, a user can select
 * a row and reach this panel, but "Zoom to" alone does not help when the
 * object sits behind other geometry, and full Isolate (the "I" shortcut, via
 * `isolateEntity`) hides everything else and loses spatial context. This
 * button instead reuses the existing X-Ray channel
 * (`ghostExceptEntities`/`setGhostExceptEntities`, already shared by Clash,
 * IDS and BCF) to fade every other entity translucent while framing the
 * camera on the selected one, so the object is visible through the rest of
 * the model instead of disappearing behind it or isolating it away from its
 * surroundings.

  // Ownership is recorded when THIS control installs the fade, not derived from
  // the set's contents at cleanup time. Content is not proof of ownership: IDS
  // row focus (useIDS.ts:685-689) and Layer Diff (LayerDiffView.tsx:92-96) both
  // install singleton ghosts and record their own ownership, so a
  // "size === 1 and has(selection)" test at unmount would tear down THEIR
  // presentation. Recording it per render had the mirror-image bug: with the
  // fade on A and the selection moved to B, cleanup compared B against A's set,
  // matched nothing, and left the model faded forever.
  //
  // The claim carries the isolation as it was BEFORE the fade, because entering
  // may widen it to admit the selection (below) and leaving has to give the user
  // back the isolation they had, not the widened one.

  // `explicit` separates the two ways the fade ends. A user clicking a toggle that
  // renders as ON is asking for the channel to clear, whoever installed it, so the

  // fade this control installed -- that is the case where clearing someone else's
