/**
 * `reassignWallOpenings` (wall-opening-reassign.ts) computes a `skipped`
 * count whenever a door/window's opening has a placement it can't
 * interpret — those openings are left attached to the wall segment that
 * `splitWallAtDistance` is about to tombstone, so they can end up
 * orphaned. The doc on `OpeningReassignSummary.skipped` says this exists
 * "so the caller can surface a warning toast", but the wall-split click
 * handler in `selectionHandlers.ts` only ever read `toLeft`/`toRight` —
 * `skipped` reached the toast call site and was discarded.
 *
 * These tests exercise `formatOpeningReassignSuffix` (the pure formatter,
 * now in `wallSplitNotice.ts` beside `notifyWallSplit` — the single emitter
 * both wall-split commit paths call) directly, and drive the real
 * `handleSelectionClick` split branch through the store to confirm the
 * `toast.info(...)` skipped-openings notice actually fires when
 * `openings.skipped > 0`, and does not fire when it's 0. The other commit
 * path — the Split tool's numeric-distance panel — is pinned against the
 * same strings by `tools/SplitNumericInput.wallSplitToast.test.tsx`.
