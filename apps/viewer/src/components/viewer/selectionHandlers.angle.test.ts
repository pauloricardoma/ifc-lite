/**
 * WIRING tests for angle mode (#2735) - click -> store -> readout.
 *
 * These exist because an adversarial review found the pure layer was
 * mutation-hardened while the layer that CONNECTS it was covered by nothing.
 * Two mutations survived the entire 5001-test viewer suite:
 *
 *   1. `handleAngleClick`'s body replaced with a bare `return` - the tool is
 *      completely dead, no pick ever registers, every test still passes.
 *   2. the panel feeding `picks[1]` as the apex instead of `picks[0]` - every
 *      displayed angle is wrong (the 3-4-5 fixture's 90 degrees renders 36.9).
 *
 * Both are invisible to tests of pure functions and of the store in isolation,
 * because neither layer is wrong: the wiring between them is. The readout test
 * below therefore asserts the NUMBER A USER WOULD SEE, computed the way the
 * panel computes it, rather than asserting that the store holds three picks.
