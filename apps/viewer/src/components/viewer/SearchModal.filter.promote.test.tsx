/**
 * "Add <query> as rule" in the Filter tab reads the search bar as a selector,
 * and keeps the historical `Name contains` for text that is not one (#4091).
 *
 * The half worth pinning is the partial reading: it applies what it can and
 * NAMES what it cannot, the same policy the Selector field above it uses.
 * Falling back to `Name contains` on the whole string, as this used to, added
 * a rule matching zero elements with nothing to read — the silent empty result
 * this change exists to remove, reached from the other entry point.
