 * The React Flow canvas over a `FlowDocument`. Every edit goes through
 * `lib/flow/editor-ops` and lands as a new document in the store; React
 * Flow is a view, not the source of truth.
 *
 * Because the canvas is fully controlled, *selection is part of the view
 * model too*: an edge whose `selected` flag is not fed back on the next
 * render is deselected by the very re-render its click caused, which is
 * why clicking an edge and pressing Delete used to do nothing at all. The
 * selected edge is held here (it is view state, not document state) and
 * written back into `toCanvas`.
