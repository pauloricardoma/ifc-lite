 * Pure decision logic for the energy-model export dialog and CLI (issues #1908, #1344), split out so it
 * is unit-testable without mounting a React component (this codebase has no
 * `.test.tsx` component tests — see AGENTS.md "Writing tests").
 *
 * `dataStore` is generic (structurally typed) rather than the concrete
 * `IfcDataStore` so tests can pass a minimal fixture with only the fields
 * these functions actually read, without an `as unknown as` cast (banned by
 * AGENTS.md). The production call site still passes a real `IfcDataStore`,

/**
 * Resolve whether an energy-model export (HBJSON or DFJSON) should regenerate STEP bytes through
 * `StepExporter` (applying the mutation view) instead of reading the model's
 * original `sourceFile` bytes verbatim. Returns the pair to pass to
 * `StepExporter` when it should, or `null` when the raw-bytes path applies.
 *
 * Regeneration only happens when the mutation view actually carries edits
 * (`mutationView.hasPendingChanges()`) — a registered-but-untouched view is
 * the common case (opening the Properties panel, `BulkPropertyEditor`,
 * `DataConnector`, or `ExportDialog` all construct and register one on open,
 * with zero edits) and must NOT route export through a StepExporter
 * regeneration — plus a parsed data store to regenerate from, source bytes
 * for `StepExporter` to re-serialize un-mutated entities from, and a STEP
 * schema (IFC5/IFCX has no STEP representation to regenerate — that stays on
 * the raw-bytes path, unchanged from before this fix).
 *
 * `hasPendingChanges()`, not `hasChanges()`: the latter reads the
 * append-only `mutationHistory`, which `restoreNewEntity` (undo of a
 * delete-then-restore, called from `mutationSlice.ts`) repopulates
 * `newEntities` WITHOUT pushing to. `hasPendingChanges()` reads the current
 * overlay footprint instead — the same set the exporter actually reads — so
 * a restored overlay-created space is not silently missed.
