/**
 * Contextual ribbon tabs — which tab opens itself, and when.
 *
 * The CAD precedent (Revit's "Modify | Walls", Office's contextual tabs) is
 * that the ribbon follows what you are working on and gives the tab back
 * when that work ends. Copied here with three hard rules, because a toolbar
 * that moves under the cursor is worse than one that never moves:
 *
 *  1. Only a RISING EDGE of a real context switches a tab. Continuous state
 *     ("something is selected") never re-fires, so clicking element after
 *     element never re-flips anything.
 *  2. Auto-switching only ever steals a NEUTRAL tab (Home, File). A user
 *     sitting on View, Analyze or Author is mid-task and is left alone.
 *  3. Everything is returnable: the tab we replaced is remembered and
 *     restored when the context drops. The moment the user picks a tab by
 *     hand that memory is dropped (the caller detects the divergence), so
 *     an explicit choice is never undone behind their back.
 *
 * This module is pure so the whole policy is unit-testable without a DOM;
 * `useRibbonContextualTab` owns the edges and the store writes.
