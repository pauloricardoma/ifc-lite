/**
 * Clicking a rule row in the active lens isolates that rule's matches.
 * Driven by rendering `LensPanel` and clicking the row a user would click,
 * then reading the store, never by grepping the handler's source.
 *
 * The defect these cover: `handleIsolateRule` pushed the raw
 * `lensRuleEntityIds` into the shared isolation channel. The renderer resolves
 * `isolatedEntities` against MESH ids (viewportUtils' `buildRenderOptions` ->
 * `isolatedIds`), so a rule matching an `IfcElementAssembly` (whose geometry
 * hangs off its `IfcRelAggregates` parts, never off the assembly id itself)
 * isolated an id that owns no mesh and the viewport went blank. Same family as
 * #2531 (Viewport's resolver), #2660 (the advanced filter's "Isolate in 3D")
 * and #1133 (assemblies are renderable through their parts).
 *
 * The lens-specific hazard is the OWNERSHIP RECORD: `lensRuleIsolation` stores
 * the exact ids the panel pushed, and `releaseRuleIsolation` only clears the
 * channel when `ruleIsolationOwnsChannel` finds the channel still holding
 * exactly those ids. Recording the raw matches while pushing the expanded ones
 * makes the lens permanently disown its own isolation: the un-isolate click
 * leaves the model stuck. That is why the round-trip lives in its own test
 * rather than as a trailing assertion.
 *
 * No models are seeded on purpose: with `models` empty and `ifcDataStore` null
 * `useLens` returns before re-evaluating, so the seeded `lensRuleEntityIds`
 * survives and the click exercises the handler with known inputs.
