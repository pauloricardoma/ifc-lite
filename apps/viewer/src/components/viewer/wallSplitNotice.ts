/**
 * The user-facing notices a committed split emits: a wall split and a
 * linear-element split. (A refused split is a command refusal: transient and
 * scoped to the running command, `lib/commands/modeling/runtime.ts`.)
 *
 * `MutationSlice.splitWallAtDistance` is reached from TWO places — the
 * `element.split` command's click and its cursor distance entry
 * (`tools/SplitCursorInput.tsx`) — and both must report the same split
 * the same way. They previously each inlined their own copy of the
 * "(N openings reassigned)" wording, and #3023 taught only the click handler to
 * also surface `openings.skipped`, so committing the identical split by typing
 * a distance instead of clicking silently dropped that warning.
 *
 * This module is the single definition of both notices. Call
 * {@link notifyWallSplit} rather than composing the toasts at a call site: a
 * shared formatter is still one a new call site can forget to call, which is
 * precisely how the two paths came apart. A shared EMITTER cannot be half-used.
 *
 * It deliberately imports nothing but the toast surface, so a call site does
 * not take on `selectionHandlers.ts`'s store, geometry and measurement imports
 * just to announce a split.

 *
 * Produced by `reassignWallOpenings` (`@/lib/wall-opening-reassign.ts`) and
 * forwarded verbatim by `splitWallAtDistance`
 * (`store/slices/mutationSlice.ts:1981`), which also substitutes an all-zero
 * summary when either half's placement chain does not resolve and the

 * unchanged, even when they now lie in the new piece (#6233: the source is
 * the larger piece, reshaped in place), so they can end up misplaced.
 *
 * `skipped` is incremented at twelve distinct sites in
 * `@/lib/wall-opening-reassign.ts` (lines 123-203), only one of which is an
 * unresolvable placement chain. The rest are an attribute the reader could not
 * read or a reference the opening does not carry — and one is not a fault at
 * all: an opening whose `PlacementRelTo` points somewhere other than the source
 * wall is skipped on purpose, because rewriting its parent placement would
 * teleport it. Zero is the ordinary outcome, which is why this stays quiet
 * then; it must not be quiet on ONE of the two commit paths when it is not.
