/**
 * Containment for GPU upload work (`createBuffer` and friends).
 *
 * Uploading a batch can throw for reasons entirely outside the app's control:
 * the GPU device was lost (Windows TDR, GPU-process crash, driver reset), or
 * the browser could not map host memory for a new buffer. Chromium reports the
 * latter as
 *
 *   RangeError: Failed to execute 'createBuffer' on 'GPUDevice': createBuffer
 *   failed, size (193836) is too large for the implementation when
 *   mappedAtCreation == true
 *
 * — misleading wording, since 193 KB is nowhere near any device limit.
 *
 * Where such a throw lands decides how bad it is, and both landing sites are
 * fatal to the viewport:
 *  - inside a React effect, an uncaught throw unmounts the tree — the <canvas>
 *    goes with it and the user is left with a blank viewer;
 *  - inside the rAF callback, it skips the tail-position
 *    `requestAnimationFrame(animate)` that re-arms the loop, so rendering stops
 *    permanently with no further frames.
 *
 * Neither is recoverable by the user without a reload, and neither is worth it:
 * a batch that fails to upload should cost that batch, not the session. This
 * helper swallows the failure, keeps a console breadcrumb, and reports ONCE per
 * session to error tracking — once, because these failures repeat every frame
 * and would otherwise flood both the console and the exception quota.
