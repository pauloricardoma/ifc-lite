 * The tree-shaken ECharts build the viewer draws with. STATIC named imports

 * and components the panel never uses; a dynamic `import('echarts/charts')`
 * asks for the whole namespace and ships all of it. `useEChart` reaches this
 * module through one `import()`, so none of it is in the first paint.
