/**
 * The Space Sketch plate lifetime, at the level where it actually goes wrong:
 * a build suspended across the overlay's unmount.
 *
 * `acquireSession` (session-registry.ts) has been mutation-checked as a pure
 * function since #1344, but the COMPONENT-LEVEL wiring around it had no
 * executable test at all — the overlay's only entry into that path suspends on
 * `ensureSpaceWasm()`, which rejects under the node harness, so the code that
 * decides what `disposedRef.current` is at the moment `acquireSession` is
 * called was verified by reading a three-line diff. Taking the wasm touch
 * points as injected dependencies is what makes it reachable: this file holds
 * `ensureWasm` pending, unmounts, then resolves.
 *
 * The leak these guard: `SpacePlateSession` owns raw Rust-heap handles freed
 * only through `dispose()`. A resumed build that allocates a fresh session into
 * a registry the unmount already cleared builds a wasm plate nothing is left to
 * free — closing the tool mid-derive leaked it (#2438 / #1344).
