/**
 * The Space Sketch canvas viewport: panel size, the world↔screen transform, and
 * every gesture that moves it (fit, wheel zoom, drag pan, resize grip).
 *
 * Split out of `SpaceSketchOverlay.tsx` because the transform has an invariant
 * the overlay was upholding by duplication rather than by structure. `fitRef` is
 * a ref — it is read synchronously ~10 times per pointer event as
 * `PICK_PX / fitRef.current.scale`, so it cannot be React state — but the
 * underlay memo reads `fitRef.current` while depending on `fitTick`, so EVERY
 * write must bump that tick or the pre-rendered building lines freeze at the
 * old transform while the rooms move. Three call sites wrote `fitRef` and two
 * open-coded the bump instead of going through `applyFit`. Here there is one
 * writer, and no way to add a second from outside.
 *
 * `sizeRef` mirrors `size` with a render-phase write. That is a deliberate
 * carry-over, not an oversight: `svgPoint`'s clamp and the fit computations read
 * it synchronously from event handlers, and moving the sync into a PASSIVE
 * effect would let the first pointer event after a resize use the stale size.
 * A `useLayoutEffect` would in fact be safe here (it commits before the browser
 * can dispatch the next input event) and would satisfy React's don't-write-refs
 * -during-render rule — but the difference between the two is not observable
 * from a test, because `act()` flushes passive effects too, so
 * `useSpaceViewport.test.tsx` cannot tell them apart. Changing untestable
 * timing inside a refactor is the trade this file exists to avoid; the write
 * stays as it was. What IS pinned there is the property that matters: `svgPoint`
 * is referentially stable, so a handler bound before a resize still clamps to
 * the new canvas.
