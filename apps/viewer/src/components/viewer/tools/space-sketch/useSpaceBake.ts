/**
 * The emit half of Space Sketch: turning every storey's draft plate into real
 * `IfcSpace`, once, on confirm.
 *
 * Split out of `SpaceSketchOverlay.tsx` because this is a self-contained
 * subject with its own state (`generatedRef`, the ids this tool authored per
 * storey) and its own failure stories, none of which involve the 2D editor:
 * re-confirming duplicating spaces instead of replacing them, one storey's
 * `addSpace` failure being reported as a "skip" and silently dropping rooms
 * from the export, and a partial failure closing the tool and discarding the
 * remaining drafts. The decisions live in `space-bake.ts`; this hook is the
 * store-facing plumbing around them.
 *
 * It also owns the ONE frame change in the tool. Everything upstream — the
 * plate, the 2D drawing, the 3D ghost, the areas — works in the room frame
 * `wall-rects-from-meshes.ts` defines, which is the model's own world frame
 * because the outlines are derived from rendered geometry. `addSpace` writes
 * into a storey-local slot, and `existingSpaceFootprintsByStorey` reads out of
 * one, so both directions cross the storey's placement chain here and nowhere
 * else. Skipping either crossing is not a small error: the chain carries the
 * site anchor, so a room lands a whole site offset away and turned by the site
 * rotation, and the dedup stops recognising the rooms already in the file.
