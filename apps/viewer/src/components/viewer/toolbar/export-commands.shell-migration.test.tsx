/**
 * #5848: pins which registered export dialogs actually render through the
 * shared `ExportDialogShell` chrome, by rendering each REGISTRY entry (not
 * the component file directly, so a future registry edit that points an id
 * at a different component is covered too), opening it, and looking for the
 * shell's `data-export-dialog-shell` marker.
 *
 * The list is every `kind: 'dialog'` registry entry, so a dialog added to the
 * registry without the shell fails here. Each one is opened through a trigger
 * the test supplies, the registry's own contract (`ExportDialogComponent`),
 * because `modified-ifc` renders no standing button while nothing has changed.
