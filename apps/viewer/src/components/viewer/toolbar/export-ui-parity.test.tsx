/**
 * Export parity between the two toolbar styles (ifc-lite#2511).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS A REGRESSION TEST FOR. Every test below traces to a specific
 * defect, and each names its own in the test title so a failure here is
 * readable without this header. Together:
 *
 * - **#2511** — the two toolbars kept separate hand-written export lists, and
 *   had already drifted on *when* a format is offered: the ribbon's Screenshot
 *   button carried no `disabled` gate, so it was clickable with no model
 *   loaded, while the classic strip's dialog rows carried no gate either and
 *   were merely unreachable behind a disabled Download trigger. Both are now
 *   one `requires` field in `export-commands.ts`.
 * - **#2511** — a federated CSV/JSON export reads only the active
 *   `ifcDataStore`, so it covers one model of several, and both styles
 *   reported it as a whole-model export.
 * - **#2510**, the sibling PR that did this for three non-export toolbar
 *   capabilities, found the hole this file had too: rendering the export
 *   clusters directly proves the clusters work, not that the shipped toolbars
 *   still host them. Deleting `<ClassicExportMenuItems />` from `MainToolbar`
 *   while leaving its import behind kept this file 10/10 green with the
 *   classic Export menu shipping empty.
 *
 * The three capability gaps that motivated the sibling guard — camera
 * rotate-90 ribbon-only, the desktop zoom cluster hidden from classic, inline
 * search classic-only — are listed in `../toolbar-parity.test.ts` (#2510).
 *
 * The viewer ships the classic `MainToolbar` strip *and* the tabbed
 * `RibbonToolbar`; a user on either must reach the same export formats. This
 * file is the gate: it renders both styles' Export clusters and asserts each
 * emits exactly the ids in `EXPORT_COMMANDS`, in the same order — so adding a
 * format to one surface and not the other fails here.
 *
 * It also nails down the three ways someone could get around the registry:
 * hand-rolling an export entry inside a toolbar (source guard), adding a
 * registry entry without teaching a style's icon set about it (icon-set
 * coverage, checked for the ribbon by source because `@/icons` only resolves
 * through the Vite plugin), and — the one that bites hardest — deleting a
 * surface's Export cluster while leaving its import behind, which every other
 * test here happily survives because they render the cluster components
 * directly rather than the toolbars that host them.
 *
 * Presence is not enough — a wired-looking button whose handler does nothing
 * has shipped here before — so the last tests actually click through both
 * surfaces and assert a download is produced, the right one is produced, and a
 * dialog opens.
