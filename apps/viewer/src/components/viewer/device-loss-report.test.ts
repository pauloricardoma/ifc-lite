/**
 * The `onDeviceLost` subscriber (#2229).
 *
 * Before this, no part of apps/viewer subscribed to `renderer.onDeviceLost`,
 * so a GPU loss was invisible: the viewer stopped drawing, the user got no
 * explanation, and error tracking got either nothing (Chromium — the renderer
 * contains the loss silently) or an untagged uncaught DOMException (Safari).
 * These tests pin what the subscriber must do, and that it stays cheap enough
 * to be safe on a path that fires from inside the renderer's listener loop.
