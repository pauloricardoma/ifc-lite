/**
 * The colour-overlay channel's whole path into the renderer: the one-shot
 * flush of `pendingColorUpdates`, split out of `useGeometryStreaming.ts`, plus
 * the catch-up that paints meshes which arrive after that flush (#3890).
 *
 * `pendingColorUpdates` is a SIGNAL, not state — the flush hands it to
 * `scene.setColorOverrides` and then nulls it out. The scene keeps the map
 * (`getColorOverrides()`), and that retained map is the only durable record of
 * what is currently painted. Until #6076 `setColorOverrides` built overlay
 * batches ONCE, looking each id up in `meshDataMap`, so an id with no mesh at
 * flush time contributed nothing and only the catch-up below revisited it.
 * The renderer now paints by id from a per-entity colour table, which reaches
 * late meshes by itself; re-handing the retained map costs one table upload.
 *
 * ## Why the catch-up waits for the DRAIN, not for the batch counter
 *
 * `geometryVersion` bumps when a batch is RECEIVED. Received is not painted:
 * `useGeometryStreaming` hands new meshes to `scene.queueMeshes`, and they
 * only enter `meshDataMap` when the animation loop drains that queue under a
 * per-frame time budget. On a large model the last batch is received long
 * before the queue empties, and the counter never bumps again — so a catch-up
 * keyed on the settled counter alone would fire exactly once, mid-drain, find
 * the meshes it is looking for still queued, and never get a second chance.
 * It therefore retries while `scene.hasQueuedMeshes()` is true.
 *
 * That same drain is why the "still waiting for a mesh" set is only narrowed
 * when the queue is EMPTY. `queueMeshes` takes `splitMeshForStreaming`
 * fragments, so one entity can be several `MeshData` sharing an expressId and
 * the drain can stop between them. An id that looks meshed mid-drain may have
 * most of itself still queued; dropping it from the waiting set there would
 * leave a large element painted in part with nothing to repaint the rest.
 *
 * ## The other two decisions
 *
 * The catch-up rebuilds only when an id it was waiting for has since arrived.
 * Without that, an active overlay would pay a full destroy-rebuild-upload
 * cycle after every later streaming burst, forever. Note the test is "did an
 * awaited id ARRIVE", not "is anything still awaited": #3880 puts the
 * geometry-less assembly id itself in the colour map next to its parts, and
 * that id never gains a mesh, so the latter would never short-circuit in
 * exactly the case this module exists for.
 *
 * And it re-hands the scene its OWN retained map, read at the moment it fires,
 * never a remembered one. That is what keeps a targeted `resetColors([part])`
 * from being repainted (the reset flushed a smaller map, so the reset id is
 * not in what the scene hands back) and keeps a correction made in the
 * meantime from being overwritten. Both hazards come from a re-expansion
 * prototype dropped in favour of #3880, both have a test in
 * `useColorOverlaySync.late-mesh.test.tsx`, and both fall out of that one
 * decision rather than needing a branch each.
 *
 * NOT COVERED, deliberately: the other colour sink, `updateMeshColors`, which
 * mutates mesh colours in `meshDataMap` in place and retains no map. There is
 * nothing to re-apply for it; giving it one is a new retained-state decision,
 * not a repaint. The renderer-side fix this paragraph once deferred landed
 * in #6076: overrides are a per-entity colour table, so a late mesh is painted
 * by id without any re-application.
