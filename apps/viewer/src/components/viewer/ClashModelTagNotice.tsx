/**
 * "The model tags this run was computed on have changed" (#4215).
 *
 * A clash run resolves tag-filtered sets from one snapshot and the engine then
 * runs for as long as the geometry takes; re-tagging a model meanwhile — or
 * after — leaves a result on screen that is right for the run and wrong for
 * the current tags. `lib/clash/model-tag-inputs.ts` records what the run used;
 * this says so next to the results, and only when a tag the run referenced
 * actually moved.
