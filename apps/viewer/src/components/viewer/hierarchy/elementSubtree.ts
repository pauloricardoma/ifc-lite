 * Emitting one spatial-tree element row (and its `IfcRelAggregates` subtree,
 * issue #1133), and emitting a whole direct-container list of them split into
 * shaped rows plus one grayed "Other" bucket (#4764) for the ones with no
 * shape. Extracted from `treeDataBuilder.ts` — which had two call sites for
 * this exact split (the single/federated spatial tree and the multi-model
 * Storeys section's per-model contribution) — so the row shape stays one
 * implementation rather than two, and so `treeDataBuilder.ts` stays under its
 * module-size budget. The rows, their "Other" shape test and the storey
 * badge all read an element's name and class through the session's mutation
 * view, so an element authored this session is labelled like any other (#6233).
