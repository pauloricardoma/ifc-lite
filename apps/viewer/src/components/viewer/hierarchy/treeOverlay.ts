 * The model tree over the model as edited (#5249).
 *
 * The "By Class", "By Type" and "Groups" builders read parsed entity
 * tables or type indexes alongside the mutation overlay. The overlay never
 * writes back into those source structures. `useHierarchyTree` folds created products into the
 * class tree (`authoredProducts`), but a deleted entity stayed listed:
 * `removeEntity` prunes its mesh, so it dropped into the grayed "Other" bucket
 * instead of disappearing. A retyped entity stayed under its parsed class.
 * Parsed rows use {@link effectiveTreeType}; the type and group builders also
 * enumerate authored entities and edited relationship endpoints (#5249).
