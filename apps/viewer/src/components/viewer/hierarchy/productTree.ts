 * An `IfcElementAssembly` — and any element used as a decomposition container —
 * has no representation of its own; the meshes sit on its `IfcRelAggregates`
 * parts. The raw `geometricIds` test therefore dropped assemblies from the class
 * tree and reported their types as having 0 instances, even though the thing is
 * plainly visible in 3D. The filter itself stays: an entity with neither
 * geometry nor a geometry-bearing part (a property set, a relationship object,
 * a container holding nothing renderable) is still excluded, so the tree keeps
 * out non-renderable clutter.
 *
 * Spatial structure classes are deliberately NOT admitted this way: IfcProject
 * aggregates the site, building and storeys, so a descendant test would drag
 * the entire spatial skeleton into a tree that is meant to list products. The
 * guard applies in BOTH `renders` and `parts`, and independent of whether the
 * geometry filter itself is active — during initial streaming `geometricIds`
 * is empty (no filter yet), and without a filter-independent guard `parts`
 * would hand IfcProject the descendant ids of the entire spatial skeleton as
 * "aggregated parts" to isolate. The name check is case-insensitive
 * (`IfcTypeEnumFromString` upper-cases before lookup) because every current
 * caller already canonicalises the type string on the way in, but nothing
 * about this predicate should silently depend on that.
 *
 * `hasAggregatedGeometry` short-circuits and shares one memo per model per
 * rebuild, and the `parts` walk is gated behind a single direct-children lookup,
 * so a whole-model scan costs one map probe for the entities (the vast majority)
 * that decompose nothing.
