/**
 * The Share dialog's scope field (#4444): with several models loaded, what
 * the room carries — the active model only, or every loaded model, each in
 * its own room slot — and the consent step that creates the room (#5599).
 *
 * The choice is live until the room exists (`editable`): a room's scope is
 * fixed by its seed, so the dialog creates the room only on "Create link".
 * Creating it uploads the model, so that step is asked for at every model
 * count and says so; with one model only the scope radios are left out.
 * Once the room exists the radios stay visible but disabled and the caption
 * reports how many models the room actually carries, which is what the seed
 * put there rather than the radio's current value.
