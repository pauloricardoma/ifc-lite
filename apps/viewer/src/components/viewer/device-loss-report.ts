/**
 * What the user and error tracking are told when the GPU device dies.
 *
 * The renderer already contains a device loss: `render()` degrades to a quiet
 * skip and `pick()` to "no hit", so nothing crashes. That containment is also
 * the problem — until #2229, NOTHING in the app subscribed to
 * `renderer.onDeviceLost()`, so a loss looked exactly like a viewer that had
 * simply stopped: no toast, no telemetry, and (on Safari, whose loss signal is
 * a synchronous throw rather than the `device.lost` promise) an uncaught
 * DOMException as the only trace.
 *
 * This module is that missing subscriber's body: one toast in the same wording
 * `gpu-upload-guard` uses for the neighbouring failure, and one tagged
 * exception so future losses arrive in error tracking as `device_lost` rather
 * than as raw stack frames nobody can attribute.
 */

/**
 * The reasons a device loss can carry, and the ONLY strings allowed into a
 * fingerprint.
 *
 * Two sources feed `info.reason`, and only one of them is ours. The WebGPU spec
 * bounds `GPUDeviceLostInfo.reason` to `'unknown'` and `'destroyed'` (and
 * `device.ts` never forwards a `'destroyed'` teardown), while `Renderer`
 * synthesises `'render-exception'` / `'render-encode-exception'` for the
 * synchronous-throw path Safari takes instead of resolving `device.lost`.
 *
 * The point of the allowlist is that a fingerprint must have a CEILING. The
 * browser-supplied half is a string we do not control: a future spec value, a
 * non-conforming engine, or a vendor that puts driver text where a reason
 * belongs would each mint a new issue group per wording, which is exactly the
 * unbounded grouping that made #3767 and #3774 two issues for one failure.
 * Anything not on this list folds into `other`, so the ceiling is five groups
 * whatever an engine hands us, and no vendor or driver text can ever reach a
 * fingerprint. The raw reason is not lost: it stays on the event as
 * `device_lost_reason`, queryable inside whichever group it landed in.
 *
 * A single `ifc-lite:device_lost` would have been simpler and is what one
 * reading of the review asks for, but it merges failures with different fixes:
 * a driver-side loss on Windows and a Safari frame throwing a DOMException are
 * not the same bug, and that is the same argument that keeps `render_degraded`
 * out of the loss group below.
