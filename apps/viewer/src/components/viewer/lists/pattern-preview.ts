/**
 * Live preview for the custom / pattern column entry (issue #1591 follow-up).
 *
 * The set-name field accepts a Bonsai-style `/regex/` pattern that pulls one
 * value across every matching property / quantity set. Before the column is
 * added, this resolves the pattern against the set names already discovered in
 * the loaded models so the builder can show "matches N sets: A, B", turning a
 * blind regex into an immediate confirmation. It reuses the SAME
 * `compileNameMatcher` the engine uses, so the preview and the executed column
 * can never disagree.
