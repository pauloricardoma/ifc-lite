/**
 * The production defect itself, reproduced at the mount site (#2401).
 *
 * Field report, from a desktop Chrome on Linux: `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Error
 * creating WebGL context.` thrown out of `HeroScene`'s mount effect on the
 * `/mcp` route, unwinding the whole route into `App.tsx`'s
 * `ChunkErrorBoundary`.
 *
 * happy-dom reproduces the device faithfully and for free: its
 * `canvas.getContext('webgl2')` returns `null`, which is exactly the condition
 * three.js turns into that throw. That is why `PlaygroundViewer.test.ts`
 * documents mounting the component as impossible — pre-fix, these renders
 * throw. So no fake is involved in the part that matters: the refusal is real,
 * three.js is real, React is real, and only the GPU is missing.
 *
 * Both surfaces are covered because they degrade differently on purpose: the
 * hero is decorative and gets a caption, the playground is functional and says
 * what still works.
