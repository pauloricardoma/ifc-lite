/**
 * The playground registry's id lookups against multi-submesh elements (#2443),
 * the transparency state its operations re-derive (#2444), and the entity
 * counts they report back to the agent (#2452, #2455).
 *
 * Why this is reachable from CI when the scene is not: only `createScene`
 * needs a GPU (`new THREE.WebGLRenderer` throws under happy-dom, which is why
 * `PlaygroundViewer.test.ts` refuses to mount the component). Everything under
 * test here — `buildEntityRecords`, `selectTargets`, and the colour/visibility
 * operations — are plain functions over an `EntityRegistry`, and the three.js
 * objects they build (`BufferGeometry`, `MeshStandardMaterial`, `Group`)
 * construct, mutate and dispose entirely on the CPU. So the defect is testable
 * even though the factory that wires it up is not.
 *
 * The fixture is the oracle, and it is the whole point: WALL_A tessellates
 * into TWO `MeshData` entries — the per-material / per-CSG-part split that
 * `packages/geometry/src/types.ts` documents as normal — and WALL_B into one.
 * A fixture with one submesh per element could not express the broken state
 * (last-wins and accumulate are indistinguishable at N=1), so it would prove
 * nothing.
