/**
 * The one hop between the geometry pre-pass and the parser worker.
 *
 * On every SAB-backed worker load at or above 2 MB the parser does not scan
 * the file at all -- the geometry pre-pass hands it a finished entity index and
 * the whole model is built from those columns. Anything the pre-pass dropped
 * is therefore invisible on the parser side by construction: a record refused
 * for an oversized express id (#3395) is not in `ids`, and a scan that stopped
 * at an unterminated string or comment (#3790) takes the entire tail of the
 * file with it. Both counts have to make this hop or the viewer renders a
 * short model and reports a clean load.
 *
 * A named function rather than an inline closure in `useIfcLoader.ts` so the
 * forwarding can be tested by calling it, instead of by reading the hook's
 * source text -- the pre-pass and the parser worker both live behind Workers,
 * and this hop is the part the viewer owns.

 * Build the `onEntityIndex` callback for `processAdaptive`, forwarding to
 * whatever `resolveSink` returns -- or doing nothing when the parser fell back
 * to the main thread and there is no worker to hand anything to.
 *
 * A resolver rather than the sink itself, because the sink does not exist yet
 * when this callback is built. `useIfcLoader` calls `processAdaptive`
 * synchronously and only assigns its `WorkerParser` in the
 * `setTimeout(startDataModelParsing, 0)` task that runs afterwards, so a helper
 * that captured the VALUE would close over null for the life of the load and
 * drop both counts on every load large enough to take this path.
 *
 * Deferred mode holds the shared columns until `release()` so parser allocation
 * can follow a geometry worker's completion. Callers also release on stream
 * completion or shutdown: empty or failed geometry must never park metadata.
 * A deadline also releases slow streams before the parser's own handoff timeout
 * could start a redundant scan. Release is idempotent; late indexes pass through.
