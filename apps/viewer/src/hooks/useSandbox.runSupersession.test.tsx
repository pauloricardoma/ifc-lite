/**
 * Cross-instance run-supersession guard for `useSandbox().execute()`.
 *
 * `useSandbox()` is instantiated independently in `ScriptPanel`, `ChatPanel`,
 * `CommandPalette` and `ExecutableCodeBlock` — each call gets its own
 * `activeSandboxRef`/closure, with nothing shared between instances. Every
 * instance still publishes to the SAME store fields
 * (`scriptLastResult`/`scriptLastError`/`scriptExecutionState`) via
 * `setScriptResult`/`setScriptError`, which apply unconditionally. Nothing
 * stopped an OLDER run (started from one instance) from publishing over a
 * NEWER run's already-displayed result (started from a different instance)
 * merely because the older one happened to settle later — e.g. a Script
 * Console run racing a `ChatPanel` auto-executed code block.
 * `useClash`/`useIDS`/`useCompare` guard the equivalent race with a per-hook
 * `runEpochRef`, but that shape cannot work here: each `useSandbox()` instance
 * has its OWN ref, so instance B's epoch never compares against instance A's
 * — they are unrelated counters. The fix (`scriptSlice.ts`'s
 * `scriptRunEpoch`) lives in the store instead, so every instance
 * reads/writes the same counter.
 *
 * **Two concerns, two epochs.** The store epoch gates only the SHARED-STORE
 * write. Collapsing "my store write is stale" and "my own script failed" into
 * one signal would itself be a bug: a slow, UNRELATED chat code block would
 * render a false error the instant a quick, separate script ran anywhere else
 * in the app (`ExecutableCodeBlock.handleRun` and `ChatPanel`'s auto-execute
 * both treat `execute()` returning `null` as "this script failed"). So
 * `execute()`'s RETURN VALUE is gated by a separate, per-instance
 * `runEpochRef` inside `useSandbox()` — only this SAME instance's own newer
 * call, or its own `reset()`, can make its own earlier call resolve `null`.
 *
 * **SETTLE ORDER IS THE PROPERTY, SO THE FIXTURE OWNS IT.** The clobber half
 * of this story only exists when the older run settles LAST — an older run
 * that settles first cannot overwrite anything, so a test where it does is
 * asserting nothing. Slowness cannot be approximated with a CPU busy loop
 * here: QuickJS is synchronous and single-threaded, so a script burning
 * millions of iterations settles its own run BEFORE a "fast" run started
 * after it has even created its sandbox — exactly backwards. The order is
 * therefore made a property of the fixture: instance A's script parks on a
 * HOST promise (`bim.clash.run`, the #2305 host-promise bridge) that this
 * file resolves by hand, and `Sandbox.runEval`'s `settleHostWork()` cannot
 * finish A's run until it does. Every test below asserts the realised settle
 * order explicitly, so a change that quietly reorders them fails loudly
 * rather than passing vacuously.

 * `execute()` needs to import `@ifc-lite/sandbox` and stand up a QuickJS
 * runtime — and the guess is wrong precisely where this file makes it
 * hardest. The #1922 tests at the bottom abort a real WASM module, and an
 * aborted module is RETIRED (`retireQuickJSModule`), so the next `execute()`
 * pays a full fresh `newQuickJSWASMModule()` instead of reusing the cached
 * one. Measured on a loaded machine, that one site reaches 46-72ms while
 * every other site here stays under ~20ms: the sleep straddled the cost it
 * was supposed to cover.
 *
 * When it lost, the damage did not stop at one test. The assertion threw with
 * the run still un-awaited, that orphaned run parked a moment later into the
 * NEXT test's freshly emptied `gates`, and that test then counted two — the
 * `0 !== 1, then 2 !== 1` pair reported as issue #3060, which read as a flake
 * because the trigger is load, not the diff under test.
 *
 * Waiting for the event instead of predicting it removes the guess rather
 * than enlarging it. Every call site keeps its exact `gates.length` assertion
 * afterwards, so a run that parks on the wrong number of gates — including
 * one that leaked in from an earlier test — still fails on the count.
 *
 * **The same guess in its other disguise.** Sites that start a second run and
 * `await` it were relying on the newer run settling to prove the older one had
 * already REACHED its gate. That is the identical assumption with the sleep
 * spelled differently, and it loses the same way: under load the older run can
 * still be standing up its sandbox, and the gate count reads 0. Those sites
 * call this helper too, and they call it AFTER their settle-order assertion —
 * that assertion is the load-bearing one, and the wait cannot mask a violation
 * of it, because a run parked on a gate cannot settle until this file opens
 * that gate.
