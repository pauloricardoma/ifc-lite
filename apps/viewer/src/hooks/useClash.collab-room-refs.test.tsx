/**
 * A clash row must be clickable in a COLLABORATIVE session.
 *
 * The collab recipient's model is put into `state.models` by
 * `collabSlice.ts` through `upsertModel` (`room:<id>`, `idOffset: 0` — the
 * hydrated meshes are already in the reconstructed store's id space). That
 * path never calls `registerModelOffset`, so the model exists for the store
 * but not for the `federationRegistry` singleton.
 *
 * `useClash`'s `refOf` resolved a clash ref through the SINGLETON
 * (`fromGlobalId`), which answers `null` for a model it does not know — so
 * `focusClash` bailed at `refs.length === 0` and every row in the panel was
 * inert. Selection from the 3D view, by contrast, resolves through
 * `resolveGlobalIdFromModels` (the store-state resolver `resolveEntityRef`
 * documents as the single source of truth) and works fine on the same model:
 * two resolvers, one id space, different answers.
 *
 * Mounts the REAL `useClash()` hook over a REAL parsed model with real meshes,
 * registered exactly the way the collab room registers it.

  /**
   * A model the identity NAMES and that is no longer loaded is known-gone, not
   * unknown — and must be refused rather than fall through to the registry.
   *
   * `refOf`'s last resort, when `ref.model` is not in `state.models`, is
   * `fromGlobalId` — a range search over the `federationRegistry` singleton.
   * The reasoning that made that safe was that the two paths which drop a model
   * unregister it in the same action, so the registry has forgotten it too and
   * the search answers `null`. That holds only for a model the registry ever
   * HELD. The collab room model is put into the store by `collabSlice`'s
   * `upsertModel({ id: 'room:<id>', idOffset: 0 })` and never goes through
   * `registerModelOffset`, so `removeModel` → `unregisterModel` is a no-op on
   * it and there is nothing to forget — while a normally loaded file's
   * registered range still covers the very same low numbers.
   *
   * Leaving a room (`collabSlice.ts`) is the ordinary way in: `removeModel`
   * runs `endClashScenePresentation(..., 'model-removed')` → `clearClashFocus`,
   * NOT `clearClash`, so the published result survives the room model and every
   * row stays clickable. Clicking one then range-searched into a different
   * file and isolated two of ITS elements, with no error — the same
   * "mis-targeted beats dead" defect as the peer-edit case above, reached
   * through absence instead of replacement.
