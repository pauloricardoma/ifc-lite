/**
 * Regression test for the retry-storm defect found in the error-path sweep
 * (see the sibling fix already applied in useAlignmentLines3D.ts
 * — "Cache empty on failure so we don't retry a doomed parse every tick").
 *
 * `ensureParseFor` memoizes a successful parse in `PARSE_CACHE` keyed by the
 * source's content hash, and a `PARSE_INFLIGHT` map de-dupes concurrent calls
 * for the same key. But on a genuine parse FAILURE, the original code cleared
 * `PARSE_INFLIGHT` and returned without ever touching `PARSE_CACHE` — so the
 * next `ensureParseFor` call for the same (still-broken) source treats it as
 * never-attempted and reruns the full-source WASM walk from scratch. Every
 * `stores` dependency change (any federated model visibility toggle, any
 * `models`/`ifcDataStore` update) re-triggers the same doomed, expensive parse.
 *
 * Fault: `store.source.toTransferable()` throws — a real, synchronously
 * reachable failure `getWholeSourceForWorker` can hit (e.g. a source whose
 * transferable has already been consumed/detached), not a mocked module.
