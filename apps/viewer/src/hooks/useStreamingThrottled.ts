/**
 * `value`, held for up to `STREAMING_PANEL_REFRESH_MS` while geometry is
 * streaming, and passed through unchanged otherwise (#6411).
 *
 * For the inputs of a memo that walks the whole model: during a stream those
 * inputs change on every geometry publish, so the memo reran twice a second
 * over a growing model. Feed the memo the held value instead. The component
 * still subscribes to `geometryStreamingActive`, so the final value lands on
 * the render where streaming ends.
 *
 * Hold only data that is progress while streaming (counts, trees). Pass values
 * that must track the store exactly, like selection or visibility, directly.
 * When `value` bundles geometry with other data, `canHold(held, next)` says
 * whether the change is geometry alone; any other change passes at once.
