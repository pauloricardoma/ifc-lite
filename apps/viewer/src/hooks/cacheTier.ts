/**
 * Which persisted-cache tier a model of a given byte length qualifies for.
 *   - `none`: too small to bother caching (parses fast), or too big for any
 *     tier, or the mesh-only tier is disabled (kill switch) and the file is >150MB.
 *   - `source`: the classic tier — persist tables + geometry AND the source
 *     buffer, so lazy property/quantity accessors + re-export read the source
 *     directly from IndexedDB.
 *   - `mesh-only`: the source-decoupled tier. Persist tables + geometry +
 *     instanced shards WITHOUT the source (too big for IndexedDB at 150-400MB);
 *     on re-open the freshly read file buffer hydrates the accessors. The hit is
 *     validated by the strengthened cache key (see `sourceFingerprint.ts`), not
 *     a full-file hash, so repeat opens have no main-thread stall.
 *
 * The ONLY difference between the two caching tiers is `persistSource` (and the
 * size band that selects them) — the save/load code is otherwise shared, so
 * {@link planCacheWrite} derives both in one place.

 *
 * The mesh-only tier hydrates cached geometry against the FRESH source buffer,
 * so a source that changed since the entry was written would form a silent
 * chimera (old geometry + new properties). The spread-sampled cache key can't
 * catch a byte-length-preserving in-place edit that lands between its sample
 * windows (a GUID/coordinate patch), so this gate is the real validation:
 *   - both mtimes known and DIFFERENT  → `miss` (a real on-disk edit; reparse);
 *   - mtime cannot confirm AND no full hash to revalidate → `miss` (never serve
 *     unvalidated);
 *   - otherwise → `serve` (mtime confirms it, or the caller can background-
 *     revalidate the full hash and reload on mismatch).
 *
 * `lastModified` of `0`/`undefined` counts as "unknown" (some `File`s lack it).
 * The classic source-persisting tier does NOT use this — it serves the cached
 * source alongside the cached geometry, so a hit is always self-consistent.
