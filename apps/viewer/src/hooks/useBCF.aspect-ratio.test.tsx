/**
 * A viewpoint captured in the viewer must be writable as BCF 3.0 (#3612).
 *
 * `@ifc-lite/bcf`'s writer refuses to invent a `Camera/AspectRatio`, which
 * v3_0/visinfo.xsd makes a required element. `writeBCF` throws on the first
 * camera that lacks one, and it throws for the WHOLE archive — so a project
 * exported with a single viewer-captured viewpoint produced no file at all,
 * only the panel's "Failed to export BCF file" error.
 *
 * The path is not hypothetical and needs no 3.0-specific UI: `readBCF` sets
 * `project.version` from the imported `bcf.version`, so importing another
 * tool's 3.0 archive and adding a topic lands here.
 *
 * This test asserts the app-side half — `getCameraState` reads the live
 * viewport ratio off the renderer — by driving the real `createViewpointFromState`
 * and then actually writing the archive. Asserting only that the field is set
 * would pass against a camera the writer still rejects.
