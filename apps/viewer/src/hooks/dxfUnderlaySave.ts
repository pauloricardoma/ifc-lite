/**
 * `dxfUnderlays`'s half of the #4153 persistence bridge — the IndexedDB
 * counterpart to `drawingMarkupSave.ts`'s `localStorage` save subscription.
 * Split into its own module for the same module-size-budget reason as that
 * file and `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts`; wired into both from
 * `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts` (`ensureDxfUnderlaySaveSubscription` alongside
 * `ensureSaveSubscription`, and {@link restoreDxfUnderlaysFor} from inside
 * that hook's `applyHash`).
 *
 * ## Why this does NOT reuse `drawingMarkupSave.ts`'s suppress/restoring-model
 * guards
 * Those guards (`suppressNextSaveFor`, `restoringModelId`) exist because the
 * five markup fields are cleared to defaults and re-restored on EVERY
 * `activeModelId` transition (`FIELD_CLASSIFICATION`'s `'committed'`), which
 * creates a window where an atomic clear looks identical to a genuine edit.
 * `dxfUnderlays` is classified `'preserved'` — `markupTransitionPatch` never
 * touches it on a switch — so there is no accompanying clear for a save
 * listener to mistake for a real change, and no restore-vs-genuine-edit
 * ambiguity to suppress. The only guard this module needs is the same
 * `stillCurrent()` check `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts` already threads through
 * every other async step in its restore effect, so a slow IndexedDB lookup
 * for a model the user has since switched away from can never land on the
 * wrong model's state.
 *
 * ## Save coalescing
 * IndexedDB writes are async; a rapid sequence of edits to the same model
 * (e.g. dragging a placement slider) must not queue unboundedly many
 * overlapping writes. `enqueueSave` keeps at most one write per hash
 * in-flight and one pending value behind it — any edits arriving while a
 * write is already running simply replace the pending value, so the pending
 * write loop below always ends up persisting whatever was most recently set,
 * without executing every intermediate value or adding a debounce timer.
