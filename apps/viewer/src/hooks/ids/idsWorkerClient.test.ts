/**
 * Contract tests for the IDS validation worker client.
 *
 * The worker is single-shot: one `Worker` per call, terminated the moment
 * the run settles (`settle()` in idsWorkerClient.ts). The load-bearing
 * assertions here are:
 *   - exactly one settle ever happens, no matter how many messages arrive
 *     after the terminal one;
 *   - a message carrying a different `id` than the one this call sent is
 *     ignored rather than resolving/rejecting/progressing the wrong call;
 *   - the worker is terminated and its handlers detached on every terminal
 *     path (complete, error, onerror, onmessageerror), not just the happy one.
