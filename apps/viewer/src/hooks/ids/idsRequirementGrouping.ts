/**
 * IDS Requirement Grouping — pure helpers to re-slice a specification's
 * per-entity results by requirement ("check") instead of by entity.
 *
 * An `IDSSpecificationResult` carries `entityResults: IDSEntityResult[]`,
 * each with a `requirementResults: IDSRequirementResult[]` produced by
 * iterating the SAME `spec.requirements` array for every entity
 * (`validateEntityRequirements` in `packages/ids/src/validation/validator.ts`).
 * The validator also reuses that same `IDSRequirement` object (not a
 * per-entity clone) for every entity it checks, so
 * `requirementResult.requirement.id` (assigned once at parse time as
 * `req-${index}`, see `packages/ids/src/parser/xml-parser.ts`) is a
 * stable key to group by ACROSS entities within one specification.
 * It is only unique within a specification, not across specifications —
 * grouping must stay scoped to one `IDSSpecificationResult` at a time,
 * which is how every caller here uses it.
 *
 * `not_applicable` is excluded from both the numerator and the
 * denominator of every rate computed here, mirroring how the validator
 * itself treats specification-level `applicableCount` / `passedCount` /
 * `failedCount` (`packages/ids/src/validation/validator.ts`): entities
 * are only ever tallied as passed or failed, never as a third bucket,
 * and the rate is `Math.floor(passed / total * 100)`.
 *
 * This module is standalone and not shared with
 * `apps/viewer/src/hooks/ids/idsExportService.ts` (the HTML/JSON export,
 * owned by a concurrent change) — it exists so the in-app panel can group
 * by requirement without touching that file.

 * Roll every entity's requirement checks in a specification into a single
 * check-level pass rate. This is a DIFFERENT measure from the specification's
 * own entity-level `passRate` (packages/ids/src/validation/validator.ts), not
 * a refinement of it, and the two move in a specific relative direction: an
 * entity counts as failed the moment ONE of its checks fails, while each of
 * its remaining checks still counts as a pass here. So the check-level rate
 * normally sits ABOVE the entity-level one — entity A passing 1 of 2 checks
 * and entity B passing both give 50% entity-level against 75% check-level.
 *
 * "Normally", not "always": the two rates have different denominators. An
 * entity whose requirements are ALL `not_applicable` counts as a passing
 * entity but contributes no applicable checks at all, so enough of those can
 * put the entity-level rate above the check-level one. Both directions are
 * pinned in idsRequirementGrouping.test.ts.
