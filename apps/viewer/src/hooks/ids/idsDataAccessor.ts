/**
 * IDS Data Accessor — thin wrapper around the canonical bridge.
 *
 * The actual `IfcDataStore → IFCDataAccessor` translation lives in
 * `@ifc-lite/ids/bridge` so the viewer, the buildingSMART corpus harness
 * (`packages/ids/src/__corpus__/corpus.test.ts`) and the MCP server share
 * one implementation. Keeping this file as
 * a re-export preserves the existing import path for callers that
 * pass through `_modelId` (currently unused but preserved for API
 * stability — the validator already takes a `modelInfo` separately).
 *
 * `mutationView`, when passed, layers any pending property edits (e.g. an
 * IDS correction applied through `MutablePropertyView.setProperty`, #3929)
 * on top of the store's own data — so a re-run of validation against THIS
 * accessor actually sees the correction instead of the pre-edit value.
 * Every other read (attributes, classifications, materials, partOf) is
 * untouched except entity membership: enumeration and `getEntityType` also
 * consult `mutationView` directly (it satisfies `EntityVisibilityView`
 * structurally, so no adapter is needed, unlike the property overlay). A
 * tombstoned entity is excluded, and an overlay-created or retyped one is
 * validated under its effective class (#5184).
 *
 * The view -> `PropertyOverride[]` projection itself lives in
 * `@/lib/ids/property-overlay-snapshot`, not here, because the IDS worker
 * needs the same projection and cannot import a `MutablePropertyView`
 * (#3946). This accessor and the worker's accessor are handed resolvers
 * built by the same function from the same snapshot, so they cannot drift.
