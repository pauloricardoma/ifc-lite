/**
 * Issue #3790: on the load path a large model takes in the browser, the parser
 * never scans the file -- the geometry pre-pass hands it the entity index and
 * the model is built from those columns. When that pre-pass stopped at a
 * record whose quoted string or block comment never closed, every record after
 * it is absent from the columns, and the flag saying so is the only evidence
 * that survives the hop. Drop it here and the user gets a partially loaded
 * model with the load reported as clean.
 *
 * The diagnostic itself is emitted downstream, by `scanIfcEntities` on the
 * `pre-scanned` path (pinned in
 * `packages/parser/src/entity-scanner.prescanned-malformed.test.ts`). What
 * this file pins is the hop the viewer owns: the flag reaching the parser
 * worker at all.

/**
 * The two ends of the hop, pinned as types. Compile-time; `pnpm typecheck`
 * is what runs them.
 *
 * `useIfcLoader` holds its parser as `(WorkerParser & EntityIndexSink) | null`,
 * so the first is the same check the hook's own declaration makes: if
 * `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex` stops accepting the two counts, this fails to
 * compile rather than the numbers going quietly missing.
 *
 * The second is the other end, and it compares PARAMETER TUPLES rather than
 * the two function types. Plain assignability is no good here in either
 * direction: TypeScript lets a function with fewer parameters stand in for one
 * with more, so geometry could widen `onEntityIndex` with a sixth argument
 * while this handoff kept forwarding five and silently dropped it -- this
 * issue's own failure mode, one release later. Verified by mutation: an
 * optional sixth parameter added to geometry's callback leaves a both-ways
 * assignability check green, and turns this one red.
