/**
 * The cross-module precedence protocol between `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts`
 * (#4159, localStorage-keyed-by-content-hash restore) and
 * `useDrawingMarkupRestoreOnLoad.ts` (#4170, IFC-embedded restore). Split out
 * of `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts` (module-size budget) rather than left
 * inline there, because this piece has its own, separate contract: it is the
 * only thing the OTHER hook depends on, and neither hook's own restore logic
 * touches it.
 *
 * `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts` resolves each active model's content hash
 * into {@link hashCache} (via {@link getCachedHash}/{@link setCachedHash})
 * and calls {@link notifyDecided} once that model's restore decision is
 * final. `useDrawingMarkupRestoreOnLoad.ts` asks {@link hasPersistedMarkupEntryFor}
 * before ever restoring a model's IFC-embedded markup — `'pending'` means
 * `useDrawing2DPersistence`'s hash for that model has not resolved yet, and
 * the caller should wait via {@link onLocalStorageDecidedFor} rather than
 * race it. See `useDrawingMarkupRestoreOnLoad.ts`'s own module doc for why a
 * plain "whichever source finishes first" race is wrong even when neither
 * outcome is individually incorrect.
