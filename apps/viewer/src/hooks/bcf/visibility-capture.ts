/**
 * The visibility half of a BCF viewpoint capture (`useBCF.ts`
 * `createViewpointFromState`): turn the viewer's hidden / isolated entity ids
 * into the `visibleGuids` / `hiddenGuids` a viewpoint records, and say what
 * could not be recorded (#4509, #4529).
 *
 * BCF addresses components by IfcGuid only. An entity with none falls in one
 * of two classes, and they are handled differently:
 *
 *  - VIEWER-ONLY (point cloud, synthetic id, unregistered model): it does not
 *    exist in the recipient's model. An isolate that mixes such entities with
 *    IFC ones records the nameable allowlist and reports the count — "hiding"
 *    an entity the recipient does not have is vacuous, while omitting the
 *    whole component would turn a focused topic into "show the whole model".
 *  - PENDING (a registered model whose metadata has not hydrated yet): the
 *    entity is real IFC and will resolve later; an allowlist written now would
 *    tell the recipient it was hidden. The capture is refused for the moment
 *    (component omitted, author told to retry) rather than recorded wrongly.
 *
 * An isolate with NO nameable member is the one shape whose only reading would
 * be "NOTHING is visible" (`DefaultVisibility="false"`, no exceptions), so it
 * is omitted rather than asserted; a genuinely empty isolate (active, matches
 * nothing — #4509) records exactly that: an empty allowlist. The hide-list can
 * only under-hide, which is the safe direction for a recipient, so its
 * shortfall is logged, not toasted.
