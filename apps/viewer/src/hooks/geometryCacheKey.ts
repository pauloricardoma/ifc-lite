/**
 * Build the persisted geometry cache key for a loaded model.
 *
 * The key folds together everything that changes the *bytes* of the cached
 * geometry so a stale entry can never be served for a different input:
 *   - `byteLength` + `fingerprint`: identify the source file content. The
 *     fingerprint is the spread-sampled hash from `computeSourceFingerprint`
 *     (head + tail + interior windows + exact length), so a KEY MATCH IS THE
 *     VALIDATION — a genuinely different file cannot key the same entry, which
 *     is why the source-decoupled tier needs no full-file hash on read/write.
 *   - `FORMAT_VERSION`: a format bump invalidates incompatible entries
 *   - `mergeLayers`: the multi-layer-wall merge flag is a load-time WASM
 *     tessellation input (issue #540). It was previously absent from the key,
 *     so toggling it and reloading served geometry built with the *previous*
 *     flag — the toggle silently no-op'd until the model was re-imported
 *     (issue #1107). Including it makes a toggle+reload a cache miss that
 *     re-tessellates with the new flag.
 *   - `skipSmallCuts`: the on-screen load skips tiny detail boolean cuts
 *     (#1286), so its cached geometry differs from a full-cut build. It must
 *     discriminate the key or a skipped display cache would be served where a
 *     full-fidelity build is expected (and vice versa).
 *   - `tessellationTier`: the load-time vertex-density tier (auto-low for heavy
 *     models, or a `?geomTier=` override). A model meshed at `low` has different
 *     bytes than at `medium`, so the tier must discriminate the key or a coarse
 *     preview cache would be served where full density is expected (and vice
 *     versa).
 *
 * The `mergeLayers`, `skipSmallCuts`, and `tessellationTier` discriminators are
 * omitted at their defaults (`false` / `medium`) so pre-existing cache entries
 * stay valid — only the opt-in / non-default paths get a distinct key.
 *
 * The desktop (Tauri) cache backend only accepts `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, so the key
 * stays filename-safe and independent of the original filename.
