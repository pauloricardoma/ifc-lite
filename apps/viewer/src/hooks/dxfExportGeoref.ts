/**
 * DXF export coordinate mapping (issue #1861): recovers true IFC world (and,
 * when georeferenced, map/CRS) coordinates from `Drawing2D`'s render-frame
 * drawing space, for a plan ('down') section.
 *
 * `Drawing2D` arrives PRE-MIRRORED on a flipped section: both cutters apply
 * the same U-axis flip before this code ever sees a point — the CPU path via
 * `projectTo2D(point, axis, flipped)` in `math.ts` (`x: flipped ? -u : u`),
 * the GPU path via `gpu-section-cutter.ts`'s `flipU` uniform, which
 * multiplies the projected U coordinate by -1 in the shader before it's
 * written out (`createPlaneData`: `data[6] = config.flipped ? -1.0 : 1.0`).
 * So for a flipped section, `drawing_x = -u` where `u` is the point's true
 * (unflipped) render-frame X; for an unflipped section, `drawing_x = u`.
 *
 * `flipped` exists purely as a *display* convention (which way the plan
 * reads on screen) — it is not a change in where the model actually sits.
 * A georeferenced CAD export must therefore report the SAME world/map
 * coordinate for the same physical point regardless of how the user had the
 * viewer's flip toggle set when they hit "Download DXF". The `(flipped ?
 * -p.x : p.x)` term below is exactly `u = flipped ? -drawing_x :
 * drawing_x)` — it UNDOES the cutter's pre-mirror, not adds a new one. The
 * net effect, by design, is that `buildDxfExportTransform`'s output is
 * flip-invariant: flipped and unflipped exports of the same section produce
 * byte-identical DXF coordinates. (This looks like a bug in isolation — a
 * flip that appears to do nothing — until you know the input was already
 * mirrored; see `dxfExportGeoref.test.ts`'s invariance test.)
 *
 * The render-frame shift (`dxfWorldShift`, shared with the DXF-underlay
 * import path in `dxfUnderlayMath.ts`) is unrelated to the flip and is
 * always undone the same way:
 *
 *   world_x = (flipped ? -drawing_x : drawing_x) + shift.x
 *   world_y = shift.y - drawing_y     // IFC Y (north), metres
 *
 * When the model carries an `IfcMapConversion` (+ `IfcProjectedCRS`), the
 * world point is further projected to map (CRS) coordinates using the same
 * eastings/northings/rotation/scale formula `reproject.ts` uses for the
 * model centre (`computeProjectedCenter`), just evaluated per point instead
 * of once at the bounds centre.
 *
 * Only a plan ('down', non-custom-plane) section has a 2D CAD-meaningful
 * georeference; front/side/custom sections pass through unchanged (per
 * issue #1861: "vertical sections ... export in drawing coordinates").
 *
 * `buildDxfMapToWorldTransform` (issue #1929) is the INVERSE of the
 * georeferenced branch above: it maps map/CRS coordinates (as authored in a
 * surveyor's georeferenced DXF) back to IFC world coordinates, for the DXF
 * UNDERLAY import path (`dxfUnderlayMath.ts`). Because `IfcMapConversion`'s
 * axis vector is normalized to unit length, its rotation matrix is
 * orthonormal — its inverse is its transpose — so the inverse is a
 * closed-form transpose-and-translate, not a division-heavy general
 * inverse. Both directions share the same scale/axis/map-unit resolution
 * (`resolveGeorefLinearParams`) so the two transforms can never disagree
 * about e.g. the Scale=0 or degenerate-axis guards.
 */

/**
 * GUARD PHILOSOPHY, stated explicitly per PR #1965 review: this file
 * (issue #1929) and `hooks/ingest/pointCloudAlignment.ts` (issue #1804)
 * both implement the inverse of `rust/core/src/georef.rs`'s
 * `local_to_map`/`map_to_local` -- now THREE independent TS/Rust copies of
 * the same inverse (Rust, `pointCloudAlignment.ts`, and this file) -- but
 * they diverge on what a malformed `IfcMapConversion` does to the caller:
 *
 *   - `pointCloudAlignment.ts`'s `invertMapConversion` /
 *     `computePointCloudAlignment` return `null` on a degenerate axis or a
 *     ~zero Scale, and the caller hides/disables the alignment toggle
 *     entirely -- there is no un-alignable-but-still-on state.
 *   - This file instead falls back: Scale=0 (or NaN/negative) becomes 1,
 *     a degenerate axis becomes the no-rotation default (1, 0), and the
 *     DXF underlay's "aligned" toggle still seeds on. See
 *     `resolveGeorefLinearParams` below.
 *
 * Both are defensible for where they sit: a point cloud's alignment toggle
 * has an obvious "off" state (raw coordinates, exactly the pre-#1804
 * behaviour) so hiding it on failure costs nothing, whereas a DXF underlay
 * has no equivalently safe fallback transform to fall back TO -- the
 * points still need to land SOMEWHERE, and "some rotation" beats "no
 * rendering at all" for a reference drawing the user can still nudge with
 * the placement offset. This file and `pointCloudAlignment.ts` are each
 * aware the other exists and chose differently on purpose; if you're
 * touching either file's malformed-input handling, check the other one
 * too before assuming your choice generalizes.
