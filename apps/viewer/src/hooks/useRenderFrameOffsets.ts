/**
 * The offsets the geometry pipeline applied to get the loaded model(s) into
 * the render frame, for turning a picked renderer-space point back into world
 * coordinates (#2199 §5).
 *
 * Unlike the Properties panel — which resolves these per SELECTED ENTITY, and
 * so per model — a picked point has no model of its own. It lands wherever the
 * cursor hit the shared scene. The scene has exactly one frame, so this
 * resolves the frame ONCE, from the earliest-loaded model: a federation is
 * aligned to the first model's RTC frame at load (see `geometry-parallel`'s
 * alignment pass), so the first model's offsets ARE the scene's offsets.
 * Reading a later model's offsets instead would report a point's coordinates
 * against a frame the scene is not actually drawn in.
 *
 * That makes the NUMBERS right in every case, and the LABEL right in all but
 * one. When alignment actually re-based another model into this frame
 * (`'same-crs'` / `'reprojected'`), a point picked on that model comes back in
 * the ANCHOR file's coordinate system, not in its own file's — the two differ
 * by exactly the transform alignment applied. Since a picked point carries no
 * model, there is nothing to invert against; what there is instead is the
 * truth, so {@link RenderFrameProvenance.rebased} is reported and the readout
 * labels the row for the frame it is genuinely in. Same rule as the rest of
 * #2199: state the basis, do not pick one silently.
