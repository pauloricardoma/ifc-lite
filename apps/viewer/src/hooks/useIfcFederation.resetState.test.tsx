/**
 * `loadFederatedIfcxFromBuffers` took a `{ resetState?: boolean }` option
 * that was NEVER READ (grep confirms exactly two hits in the source file:
 * the declaration and one call site). The function unconditionally calls
 * `resetViewerState()` / `setGeometryResult(null)` / `clearAllModels()`
 * regardless of what the caller passed. `addIfcxOverlays` called it with
 * `{ resetState: false }`, which reads as "preserve selection/hidden/
 * isolated state while adding an overlay" but that intent was silently
 * discarded.
 *
 * Investigation (recorded here, not just in the PR description, so the
 * "why" survives): expressIds in the composed IFCX entity table are
 * SYNTHETIC and auto-incrementing over iteration order of the composed
 * node map (`packages/ifcx/src/entity-extractor.ts`). That iteration order
 * is seeded by `LayerStack.getAllPaths()`, which walks layers STRONGEST
 * FIRST and inserts each layer's own path order first-come-first-served
 * into an insertion-ordered Set (`packages/ifcx/src/layer-stack.ts`).
 * Adding an overlay makes it the new strongest layer, so the overlay's own
 * path order gets spliced to the FRONT of that Set - ahead of paths that
 * previously sorted earlier. That reshuffles which entity gets which
 * expressId, even for a PURE property overlay that adds zero new paths.
 *
 * This was verified empirically against real fixtures
 * (tests/models/ifc5/Hello_Wall_hello-wall.ifcx + ...-add-fire-rating-60.ifcx):
 * of 9 entities shared between "base alone" and "base + fire-rating overlay",
 * 5 of 9 got a DIFFERENT expressId after recomposition, despite the overlay
 * changing no geometry and adding no entities. Since federated models use
 * `idOffset: 0` for every layer (globalId === expressId), a selection/
 * hidden/isolated set captured before the overlay would silently point at
 * DIFFERENT entities after it — exactly the "3D highlighting" corruption
 * the in-code comment warns about. So the reset is CORRECT and the dead
 * option is a lie: honouring `resetState: false` would reintroduce that
 * bug. Conclusion: delete the option, keep the reset, document overlay-add
 * as intentionally destructive to viewer state at the call site.
 *
 * These tests pin:
 *  1. BOUNDING CONTROL - a first federated load resets state (unchanged
 *     behaviour, must never regress).
 *  2. The behaviour this fix is choosing: adding an overlay to an already-
 *     loaded federation ALSO resets state (selection/hidden/isolated all
 *     clear), because ids are not stable across recomposition.
 *
 * A third test used to grep `useIfcFederation.ts` for the identifier
 * `resetState` and assert zero hits. It is gone (#2434): deleting the reset
 * outright — the whole harm the dead option threatened — leaves that grep
 * green while both tests below go red, so it contributed no failure-detection
 * power. What matters is not that a spelling is absent but that the reset
 * happens on EVERY composition, and that is what 1 and 2 assert. If someone
 * re-adds the option and honours `resetState: false` from `addIfcxOverlays`,
 * test 2 fails on the behaviour rather than on the name.
