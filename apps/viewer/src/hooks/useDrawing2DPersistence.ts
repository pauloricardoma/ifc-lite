/**
 * Wires `drawing2DSlice.persistence.ts` up to the live store (issue #4153).
 *
 * `drawing2DSlice.ts` is at its module-size budget, and the scoping key this
 * needs — a model content hash — is not known at slice-init time (no model
 * is loaded yet when the store is constructed) nor is it a field on
 * `FederatedModel` (adding one would grow `store/types.ts`, also at budget).
 * So this lives as an external bridge instead of slice actions: this React
 * hook resolves the active model's content hash and restores its markup;
 * `drawingMarkupSave.ts` (split out at the same time, module-size budget)
 * owns the raw store subscription that saves on every change to the
 * persisted fields — mirroring "call from the slice initializer and on each
 * mutating action" without adding either to the slice itself. See that
 * module's doc for the save path's own two-bug history (#4159 Bug 2, Bug 4)
 * and why it derives its scoping hash synchronously rather than from a
 * variable this hook owns.
 *
 * Mounted once, unconditionally, in `DrawingRuntimeHost` (#5492), which has
 * no view of its own, so restore runs as soon as a model loads even with no
 * drawing view on screen.
 *
 * `dxfUnderlays` (issue #4153, reopened) rides the same resolved hash but is
 * NOT one of `drawingMarkupSave.ts`'s five committed fields — it is
 * IndexedDB-backed (`drawing2DSlice.dxfPersistence.ts`) and additively
 * restored by `dxfUnderlaySave.ts`'s `restoreDxfUnderlaysFor`, called from
 * `applyHash` below once the hash resolves. See that module's doc for why
 * its restore never clears or replaces the live array the way the markup
 * fields do.

 * Resolves the active model's content hash (from `FederatedModel.sourceFile`)
 * and restores that model's persisted markup into the store. This is a TRUE
 * full-content SHA-256 (`computeFullSourceHashFromBlob`), NOT the
 * window-sampled fingerprint `services/ifc-cache.ts` keys its geometry cache
 * on: that sampler is a deliberately O(1) cache-lookup key with a proven
 * blind spot (an edit landing between its sample windows is invisible to
 * it — see `@ifc-lite/cache`'s `source-fingerprint.ts`'s docs), safe there only because a
 * false key-hit is still gated by an mtime guard and this same full hash as
 * a background revalidation layer. Markup restore has no such second gate —
 * whatever this resolves to is used directly as the `localStorage` key — so
 * it must be an identity that cannot collide on two genuinely different
 * models, not merely a fast one. Restores defaults (i.e. does nothing — the
 * fields are already `[]`/defaults after `resetViewerState`) when nothing is
 * saved for the hash, or when a hash cannot be computed at all (no
 * `sourceFile` — e.g. a cache-restored model), which degrades to today's
 * non-persisted behaviour for that load rather than throwing.
 *
 * ## Precedence over #4170's IFC-embedded restore (`useDrawingMarkupRestoreOnLoad.ts`)
 * `applyHash` below writes unconditionally — no emptiness check — by
 * design: a `localStorage` entry, when one exists for this exact
 * full-content hash, is ALWAYS authoritative over whatever markup happens
 * to be embedded in the IFC bytes themselves, never merely "whichever
 * source got there first". Two reasons. First, the hash is the file's true
 * content — a `localStorage` entry keyed to it can only exist because a
 * session in THIS browser already had these exact bytes open; anything
 * that session then drew (or deleted) is necessarily at least as recent as
 * whatever was embedded in the file before that session started, so it is
 * never staler, only possibly newer. Second, and more important: a rule
 * that instead let "whichever restore's async work resolves first" decide
 * would make the SAME code produce different results across runs for the
 * SAME inputs, only because of incidental timing — a hash computation or a
 * WASM parse finishing a few milliseconds sooner or later. That is a race
 * even when neither outcome is technically "wrong" in isolation, and
 * `hasPersistedMarkupEntryFor`/`onLocalStorageDecidedFor` exist so the IFC
 * restore can wait for this decision instead of guessing from current
 * array contents (which can't tell "no source has run yet" apart from
 * "this source ran and correctly produced empty").
