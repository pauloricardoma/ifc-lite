/**
 * User cancel for a model load (#5849).
 *
 * The loader marks the in-flight work stale and aborts its geometry stream.
 * A primary load returns to an empty viewer; a federated add leaves the
 * already-loaded models in place. Neither path reports a user cancel as an
 * error.
 *
 * The canceller is published through the store's `activeLoadCanceller`,
 * which the status-bar Cancel and the in-viewport loading card both read
 * (`selectLoadCanceller`). The slot has to live in the store: every component
 * calling `useIfc()` owns its own loader instance and session counter, and
 * only the instance that started the load can supersede it. It is not
 * `activeStreamCanceller`: GPU device-loss recovery cancels that slot, and a
 * model load must survive a device loss.
