/**
 * Export one zone's geometry as a model of its own (issue #2508 item 2).
 *
 * #1810 asked for "either geometric splitting or a per-zone quantity
 * breakdown". #2515 shipped the breakdown; this is the splitting, and the
 * reason to want it is the sentence in #2508: actual splitting is what a user
 * needs to EXPORT a per-section model. So the deliverable is a file, not a
 * viewport state.
 *
 * What goes into one zone's file:
 *
 *  - every element whose home zone it is and which does not straddle, whole;
 *  - the CUT PIECE of every straddler that reaches it, from the exact kernel.
 *
 * Three things it refuses to do, each for a reason that already has a
 * precedent in this feature:
 *
 *  - **Run on load.** It is an explicit click, like the apportionment, and for
 *    a stronger reason: an exact arrangement per (element x zone) is orders of
 *    magnitude dearer than the divergence clip that produces the NUMBERS.
 *    Measured through this same wasm build on `AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc` with four
 *    zones tiling its 18 m length: 18 elements produced more than one piece, at
 *    ~357 ms each (6.4 s in total). So this runs per zone, on demand, over the
 *    elements that reach that zone, and its cost is reported back to the user
 *    rather than hidden.
 *  - **Split what the mesher could not prove.** A clip of an open shell
 *    produces pieces whose volumes are arbitrary, not approximate. Those
 *    elements are counted and reported, never quietly dropped.
 *  - **Publish a split that does not add up.** `splitElementByZones` refuses
 *    per element; the count reaches the user.
