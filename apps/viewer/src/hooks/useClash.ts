  /**
   * Resolve a clash ref back to its model + local expressId. `null` means "this
   * row is inert": every caller reads it that way (`focusClash` bails at
   * `refs.length === 0`), so a resolver that is merely INCOMPLETE silently
   * disables the whole panel, and one that is merely OPTIMISTIC silently
   * targets the wrong element.
   *
   * ## Which model
   *
   * A `ClashElementRef` carries both halves of its identity: `ref` (the
   * federated global id) and `model` (the store model id it was gathered from,
   * `adapters/step.ts` `model: modelId`). Resolving against the NAMED model,
   * rather than searching for whichever model's range happens to contain the
   * number, removes the ambiguity between two models that both claim it — a
   * collab room model and a normally loaded one both sit at `idOffset: 0`.
   *
   * The `federationRegistry` singleton (`fromGlobalId`) did that search, and
   * knows only models that went through `registerModelOffset`. A model put into
   * `state.models` any other way is invisible to it. That is exactly the collab
   * room model: `collabSlice`'s recipient reconstruct registers it with
   * `upsertModel({ id: 'room:<id>', ..., idOffset: 0 })` and never calls
   * `registerModelOffset`, so in a room EVERY clash row was dead — while
   * clicking the same element in the 3D view selected it normally, that path
   * resolving through `state.models` (`resolveEntityRef`).
   *
   * The lookup itself is DELEGATED to `resolveGlobalIdInModel`, which shares its
   * range and overlay predicates with the store's canonical
   * `resolveGlobalIdFromModels`. A private range check here would be another
   * spelling of "which ids does a model own", and would miss the overlay ids
   * (StoreEditor duplicates, scripted adds) the canonical resolver's second pass
   * exists for. Two resolvers disagreeing about one id space is what produced
   * this bug in the first place.
   *
   * ## No fallback search across LOADED models
   *
   * The registry fallback is reached only when `ref.model` is not in
   * `state.models` at all — its documented purpose, and the only case it can
   * honestly serve. It used to run whenever the range check missed, which
   * quietly covered a second, very different case: the named model IS loaded
   * and simply does not own this number. There `fromGlobalId` range-searches and
   * can answer with a DIFFERENT model, reintroducing exactly the ambiguity this
   * resolver exists to remove — and the supersede check below cannot catch it,
   * being keyed on `ref.model`, so the model the search wandered into is never
   * validated at all. A ref that does not fit its own loaded model is now
   * `null` — inert and visible beats resolved and wrong.
   *
   * The remaining fallback is reached only by a ref whose model the supersede
   * gate below did not refuse — which, since that gate now answers `false` for a
   * model its identity NAMES and that is gone, means a ref the result holds no
   * identity for at all: a hand-built fixture, or a result published before
   * identities existed. Those have nothing to compare against, and the registry
   * is the only thing that can still answer them, so the pre-existing behaviour
   * is kept for exactly that case.
   *
   * It used to be reached by every ref into an absent model, on the reasoning
   * that the two paths which drop one unregister it in the same action
   * (`removeModel` → `federationRegistry.unregisterModel`, `clearAllModels` →
   * `federationRegistry.clear()`), so the registry had forgotten it too and the
   * answer was `null` anyway. That does NOT hold for a model the registry never
   * held, which is precisely the class this resolver was fixed for: the collab
   * room model is created by `upsertModel` with `idOffset: 0` and no
   * `registerModelOffset` call (`collabSlice`), so `unregisterModel` is a no-op
   * for it and there is nothing to forget. Leaving the room while a published
   * clash result is kept drops `room:<roomId>` from `state.models` and sent its
   * refs down this fallback, where `fromGlobalId` range-searched the registry
   * and landed inside a DIFFERENT, still-loaded file — isolating and painting
   * two of its elements, with no error. Established by review with an executed
   * probe, and closed one level up in `clashRefModelIsCurrent`: a named model
   * that is gone is known-gone, and a known-gone model's refs are refused with
   * the same message and the same "refuse, don't clear" reasoning as a
   * superseded one.
   *
   * NOTE on exactness: this resolver is only as good as the `ref` it is handed.
   * Until #2704 it was handed a broken one for any federated model past the
   * first — `useIfcLoader` shifts `mesh.expressId` by `idOffset` at load, and
   * `elementsFromStep` put that already-shifted id through `toGlobalId`,
   * applying the offset twice, so the ref fell outside its own model's range
   * and this resolver answered `null`: every such row inert. #2704 hands
   * `elementsFromStep` the `meshIdOffset` it needs (see `gatherElements`), so
   * the offset is applied exactly once and those refs land in range and
   * resolve. `useClash.federated-id-offset.test.tsx` drives the two halves
   * together — ref built by the real `run()`, resolved by the real
   * `highlightAll()` — because neither half's own tests can see the join.
   *
   * ## Which id SPACE
   *
   * Naming the model is not enough, because the id space behind a model id can
   * be REPLACED while the id stays: a collab peer edit re-derives the model
   * from the CRDT and calls `setIfcDataStore`, which swaps the entity table
   * under the same key and leaves `idOffset` and `maxExpressId` untouched
   * (`dataSlice`). Express ids are a sequential counter over composed-node
   * order (`packages/ifcx/src/entity-extractor.ts`), so any structural edit
   * renumbers everything after it — and every stale ref then still looks
   * resolvable, and resolves to the WRONG element. Leaving a room and rejoining
   * rebuilds `room:<roomId>` the same way.
   *
   * So the result's own recorded federation identity — captured by the run and
   * bound to the result object at the publish site
   * (`lib/clash/federation-identity.ts`) — is checked FIRST, for the model THIS
   * ref names. Per-model, not federation-wide: see `clashRefModelIsCurrent` for
   * why the publish gate's whole-federation question is the wrong one to ask of
   * a single ref. The check lives here rather than in each of `focusClash` /
   * `selectElement` / `highlightAll` because that is an enumeration of call
   * sites, and the next caller added would not be covered.
   *
   * Refuse — not clear. What is actually wrong with a superseded row is that its
   * NUMBERS no longer denote what they denoted; everything else it carries —
   * the recorded `name`, GlobalId, distance and severity — is still a true
   * record of what the run found, and stays readable and exportable. Clearing
   * would throw that away, out of a click handler, at the moment the user asked
   * to look at it, and would orphan the review statuses they had already set
   * (`clashReviews` survives `clearClash` by design, but has nothing left to
   * annotate). Refusing stops the one harmful act — resolving stale numbers —
   * and leaves the remedy, a re-run, one click away and named on screen.
