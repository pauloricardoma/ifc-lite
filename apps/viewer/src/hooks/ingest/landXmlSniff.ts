/**
 * Filename-only candidacy check. A `.xml` file is handed straight to the
 * authoritative Rust parser, which validates the root element and namespace
 * while streaming and refuses anything else with LXML006/LXML007.
 *
 * This module used to also export a content sniffer (`isLandXmlContent`, with
 * `decodeXmlHead`/`rootStartTag` helpers) built for #4937's "content sniffing
 * for generic .xml" item. The authoritative-parser design superseded it before
 * it ever gained a caller, and it sat dead behind four tests that implied
 * coverage of a path nothing took. Removed rather than left as a just-in-case
 * path.
 *
 * If content sniffing is wanted again, note what it costs: deciding from the
 * bytes means reading past an arbitrarily long but legal XML prolog, which is
 * the whole reason the streaming parser owns this today.
