/**
 * Re-baking an already-loaded federation against the current anchor.
 *
 * `realignFederation` (useIfcFederation.ts) is the caller; the loop lives here
 * so it can be driven without a React store, and because federationAlign.ts is
 * already over the module-size guideline.
 *
 * Two rules this module exists to keep:
 *
 *  1. **"Do not align" is not "do not restore".** The anchor must never be
 *     ALIGNED — it defines the frame — but it must be RESTORED if it was ever
 *     aligned as a non-anchor. Switching the anchor X → A bakes X's geometry
 *     into A's frame; switching back to X used to `continue` past X before the
 *     restore step, leaving X defining a frame its own vertices are not in and
 *     every other model aligned to a frame X had left (#2007).
 *
 *  2. **The anchor is restored BEFORE anything is aligned into it.** The frame
 *     a model lands in is the anchor's `CoordinateInfo` (its RTC/shift choice),
 *     and alignment REPLACES that field on the model it re-bakes. So an anchor
 *     still carrying the previous anchor's `CoordinateInfo` hands every other
 *     model the wrong destination — restoring the anchor's vertices but reading
 *     its frame first fixes half the bug and hides the other half.
 *
 * The restore covers the whole set alignment touches: positions, normals,
 * per-mesh local-frame origins, coordinateInfo, per-entity world boxes and the
 * instanced-only world boxes. #2005 fixed two cases of a restore path covering
 * less than the alignment wrote and the origins were a third (found by running
 * the real `Building-Architecture.ifc` + `Infra-Bridge.ifc` federation through
 * two anchor switches), so capture and restore are defined next to each other
 * here and cannot answer different questions.

   *    left the index finding 7 of 78 meshes inside the model's own bounds
