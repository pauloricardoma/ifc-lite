/**
 * `useBCF`'s `applyViewpoint` isolation arm (#3338 / #3389).
 *
 * Two properties, and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *  - a viewpoint's `visibleGuids` name whatever the AUTHORING tool recorded,
 *    which is not guaranteed geometry-bearing in this renderer, so a
 *    geometry-less `IfcElementAssembly` must be expanded to its parts before
 *    it reaches `setIsolatedEntities` (#3338);
 *  - applying a viewpoint is a "put the view into exactly this state"
 *    operation, so the assignment must happen on EVERY apply. Skipping it
 *    when the resolver answers `[]` ("resolved, nothing renders") leaves the
 *    PREVIOUS viewpoint's isolation on screen while the BCF panel reports the
 *    new viewpoint as applied -- one viewpoint's content mislabelled as
 *    another's, which is worse than the blank view main produced.
