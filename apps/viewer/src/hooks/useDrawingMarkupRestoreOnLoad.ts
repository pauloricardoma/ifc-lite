/**
 * Restore-on-load for "save 2D drawing markup into the IFC model" (#4153):
 * when a model is parsed, populate `Drawing2DState`'s markup arrays from any
 * `DRAWING_MARKUP_OBJECTTYPE`-tagged `IfcAnnotation` entities it contains.
 *
 * ## The double-restore question (PR #4159's own localStorage restore)
 * #4159 (`useDrawing2DPersistence.ts`, `drawing2DSlice.persistence.ts`)
 * restores the SAME flat `measure2DResults`/`polygonArea2DResults`/
 * `textAnnotations2D`/`cloudAnnotations2D` fields from `localStorage`, keyed
 * by the loaded file's content hash. A model that is BOTH (a) the exact
 * bytes of a file the browser has a saved localStorage entry for, AND (b)
 * itself carries embedded markup annotations (only possible by re-opening a
 * file this feature previously saved into and then not re-exporting) has
 * two candidate sources for the same four arrays.
 *
 * An earlier version of this module resolved that with "never overwrite":
 * whichever source populated the (checked-empty) fields first wins. That
 * was wrong in two ways, not just undocumented. First, it was asymmetric in
 * fact, not just in the doc: `useDrawing2DPersistence`'s `applyHash` has
 * never had an emptiness check, so an IFC restore that happened to finish
 * first got silently clobbered the instant the localStorage hash resolved
 * — the exact opposite of "first wins". Second, even a SYMMETRIC emptiness
 * guard on both sides would still be a race: which restore's async work
 * resolves first depends on incidental timing (a hash computation vs. a
 * WASM parse), so the SAME code, same inputs, can pick either source
 * depending on nothing meaningful. And an emptiness check specifically
 * cannot even ask the right question — it cannot distinguish "no source
 * has restored yet" from "the authoritative source restored and correctly
 * produced an empty result" (e.g. the user deleted all their local markup
 * and that was saved).
 *
 * The rule this module now enforces: LOCALSTORAGE IS AUTHORITATIVE,
 * EXPLICITLY, NOT BY TIMING. A `localStorage` entry for this exact
 * full-content hash can only exist because a session in this browser
 * already had these exact bytes open — whatever that session drew (or
 * deleted) is therefore never staler than whatever is embedded in the file,
 * only possibly newer. `tryRestoreDrawingMarkup` below calls
 * `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts`'s `hasPersistedMarkupEntryFor` before ever
 * restoring the IFC's embedded markup: if that reports `'pending'` (the
 * hash hasn't resolved yet), this module WAITS, via
 * `onLocalStorageDecidedFor`, rather than racing it; if it reports `true`
 * (a saved entry exists, empty or not), this restore backs off for good;
 * only `false` (no entry — never saved for this file, or `localStorage`
 * unavailable) lets the IFC-embedded markup through. The outcome is now a
 * pure function of "does a localStorage entry exist", never of which
 * promise happened to settle first.
 *
 * `restoredForModel` additionally makes each model's restore attempt
 * run-once-until-emptied: a model this session already attempted (whether
 * it found markup or not) is not retried on every parse-cache notification
 * or remount, so drawing on a blank model and then having a LATER parse-cache
 * tick (e.g. a federated sibling model finishing its own parse) never
 * suddenly injects the model's embedded markup over what the user just drew.

 * `decidedListeners` until that promise finally settles, then fires and
 * no-ops against `tryRestoreDrawingMarkup`'s own `activeModelId` guard — a

 *
 * Safe to drop: cancelling here never loses a legitimate pending restore.
 * `tryRestoreDrawingMarkup` already refuses to write for any model that
