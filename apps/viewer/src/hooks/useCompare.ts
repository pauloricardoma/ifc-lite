 * Model-comparison orchestration hook (issue #924).
 *
 * Owns the "run a comparison" action for the Compare panel: it reads the two
 * chosen federated models from the store, builds per-entity fingerprints via
 * the viewer adapter, and runs the `@ifc-lite/diff` engine. Building
 * fingerprints (on-demand property extraction per entity) is the expensive
 * part, so the built sides are cached per A/B pair - toggling the
 * data/geometry scope OR the ignored-classes blacklist re-runs only the cheap
 * `diffModels` pass.

 * effect below go through here.
 *
 * INVARIANT this function exists to protect (the #1891 P1 fix). The diff options
 * are read HERE, and nothing may `await` between that read and
 * `setCompareResult`:
 *
 * - **Read here, never in a caller.** The scope / blacklist / matching controls
 *   stay live while a comparison is in flight, so a value captured before
 *   `runComparison`'s awaits (the frame yield plus fingerprint extraction) can be
 *   stale by the time the fingerprints land. Publishing such a value made the
 *   panel disagree with its own controls - counts, rows, overlay and exported CSV
 *   all - until the user moved some other option or re-ran. Latent since #924 for
 *   scope + blacklist; the content-matching checkbox is merely the first of the
 *   three a user reaches for mid-run.
 * - **Stay synchronous.** With no `await` between the read and the publish, no
 *   event handler can interleave, so the published result cannot be stale by even
 *   one option change. Adding an `await` in here reintroduces the P1.
 *
 * Together those are what let the reconciliation effect below omit `result` from
 * its deps: a published result always agrees with the store, so there is nothing
 * for a `result`-triggered re-run to catch, and no `setCompareResult` ->
 * re-render -> re-diff cycle.
 *
 * Fingerprint extraction (the expensive part) already happened, so this is cheap
 * enough to re-run on every scope / blacklist / matching change.
 *
 * @returns the published result, plus the matching flag it ran with - telemetry
 *   reports the OPTION, of which `diff.contentMatches` is only a derivation.
