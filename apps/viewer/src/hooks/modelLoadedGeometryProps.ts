/**
 * Geometry-attribution properties for the `ifc_model_loaded` event (issue #2388).
 *
 * #2388 observed the SAME file on the SAME build reporting two different
 * `total_triangles` with an identical `mesh_count`, i.e. the extra triangles are
 * distributed *within* existing meshes. `total_triangles` alone cannot say which
 * of the geometry pipeline's environment-conditional inputs moved, because none
 * of them rode the event:
 *
 *  - `totalCsgFailures` reached the main thread on the streaming `complete`
 *    event but was only `console.info`'d (`useIfcLoader`, added in #1439) — it
 *    was never captured, so no historical load can be attributed at all.
 *  - `skipSmallCuts` (viewer `geometryMode`) and the load-time tessellation tier
 *    (`resolveLoadTessellationTier`, plus the persisted `?geomTier=` override and
 *    the resource-retry downgrade to `lowest`) BOTH change per-element triangle
 *    counts while leaving the mesh roster untouched — the exact signature of
 *    #2388 — and BOTH are resolved from `localStorage`, so two browsers on one
 *    build legitimately mesh the same file differently. Neither records a CSG
 *    failure: the small-cut skip returns the un-cut host with no `record_failure`
 *    call at all (`rust/geometry/src/processors/boolean/mod.rs`), so a load that
 *    differs only by these reports `total_csg_failures: 0`.
 *
 * Absent diagnostics stay ABSENT rather than being flattened to `0`. A fabricated
 * zero would read as "CSG ruled out" on a load where the counter never arrived,
 * which is precisely the mis-attribution this field exists to prevent.
