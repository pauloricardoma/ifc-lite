/**
 * IDS validation worker.
 *
 * IDS validation is pure CPU work over the whole entity population — on
 * the main thread it pins the UI (no progress paints, frame rate
 * collapses) exactly like an unworkered parse would. Every other heavy
 * stage in this viewer (STEP parse, geometry) already runs in a worker;
 * this brings validation in line.
 *
 * The worker re-parses the IFC source bytes (~150ms for a 550k-entity
 * model — negligible next to validation) into its own IfcDataStore so
 * the main-thread store is never touched, then runs the shared
 * `@ifc-lite/ids` validator with the canonical bridge accessor. The IDS
 * XML is parsed on the main thread (workers have no DOMParser) and the
 * plain IDSDocument is handed across; progress is streamed back as it
 * happens.
