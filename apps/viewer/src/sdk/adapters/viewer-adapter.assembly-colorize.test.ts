/**
 * #3338, the COLOUR channel.
 *
 * `pendingColorUpdates` is flushed to the renderer, which looks each id up in
 * its mesh set. A geometry-less `IfcElementAssembly` id is not in that set, so
 * `ifc.viewer.colorize([assemblyRef], red)` painted nothing: the assembly's
 * parts kept their original colour and the script reported success. Same
 * failure as the SDK `hide()` in `visibility-adapter.assembly.test.ts`, same
 * cause, and the same fix — route through the shared presentation resolver.
