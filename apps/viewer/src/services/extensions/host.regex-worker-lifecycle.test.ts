/**
 * `ExtensionHostProvider.tsx` calls `service.dispose()` from an effect
 * cleanup on a `service` built via `useMemo(() => new ExtensionHostService(...), [bim])`
 * — an identity that survives React StrictMode's simulated
 * mount/cleanup/mount. `dispose()` used to latch the shared
 * `regexWorkerClient`'s `disposed` flag permanently, so the SECOND
 * `init()` call StrictMode triggers reused a client that would reject
 * every future `evaluate()` with "disposed" for the rest of the page
 * session — surfacing to the author as "invalid pattern" (#4505
 * finding C). `init()` now resets the client so a dispose()-then-init()
 * cycle on the SAME service instance doesn't poison it.
