/**
 * `ExtensionHostService` wires `runBundleTests`' `evaluateRegex` hook to
 * `regexWorkerClient.evaluate()` (a real `Worker`, #4482). An environment
 * with no `Worker` at all, or a CSP that blocks module workers, makes
 * `createRegexWorkerClient()`'s factory throw — and until #4505 that
 * rejection reached the caller as-is, so EVERY `expect.regex` matcher
 * failed, where before #4482 they all ran in-process. This suite runs in
 * Node, which has no global `Worker` either, so it exercises the real
 * fallback path rather than a simulated one: `evaluateRegexWithFallback`
 * must catch exactly that "worker didn't start" failure and fall back to
 * `defaultRegexEvaluator`, the same synchronous in-process check the
 * runner used before #4482 existed.
