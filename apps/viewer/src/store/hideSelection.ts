/**
 * "Hide selection": the one implementation every surface calls (#5852).
 *
 * Previously, the keyboard, ribbon, classic toolbar, palette, mobile toolbar
 * and context menu each hid in their own way: some kept
 * the (now invisible) selection, one hid only the primary entity, one hid only
 * the right-clicked entity. The rule here is the single answer:
 *
 *  - every selected entity is hidden (the multi-selection, else the scalar
 *    primary `selectedEntityId`);
 *  - the selection is then cleared on both channels, so a hidden entity is
 *    never what Properties shows or what the next key acts on.
 *
 * Not a Hide-selection surface, so deliberately not routed here: the model
 * tree's per-node eye toggle (`HierarchyPanel.handleVisibilityToggle`) hides or
 * shows one tree node's elements, whatever is selected.
 *
 * P2 (#5611) will change what "hidden" is stored as; this module is the call
 * site it updates.
