/**
 * One source of truth for "the section cut is on screen" (#4806, #4910,
 * #5893).
 *
 * Until #5893, the renderer only applied the cut while the Section tool was
 * active (`useAnimationLoop` gated on `activeTool === 'section'`) and this
 * module enforced that as a store invariant: `sectionPlane.enabled` was true
 * ONLY while the tool was open, forced off ("parked") the moment it closed.
 * That made the cut and the tool the same lifetime, so you could not measure
 * inside a section — opening Measure parked the cut — and a resumed cut
 * disappeared again the instant you left the tool for anything else.
 *
 * The cut is now lasting scene state: `sectionPlane.enabled` means "the user
 * has a cut turned on", independent of which tool is active, and
 * `sceneState.section.visible` (`store/slices/sceneStateSlice.ts`) is the
 * one further toggle that hides it without discarding it — the HUD chip
 * (`SectionParkedChip`) and the visibility-reason registry (#5869) drive
 * that toggle, not `activeTool`. `activeSectionPlane()` is the accessor every
 * consumer (SDK `getSection()`, view/PDF export, BCF capture, grid clipping,
 * the renderer gate) reads for "the visible cut": both `enabled` and
 * `sceneState.section.visible` must hold.
 *
 * `sectionPlane.parked` is kept for the readers that predate this slice
 * (`DrawingPanel`, tours, `basketViewActivator`) and now means "hidden — off
 * screen, but remembered rather than forgotten": either the cut is on
 * (`enabled: true`) and hidden by the visibility toggle (set by
 * `setSectionVisible` / `toggleSectionVisible`), or it was turned fully off
 * while a reader wanted to remember there was one (the historical
 * `enabled: false, parked: true` shape — no longer produced by a tool
 * switch, since #5893 removed the automatic forcing; a caller that wants
 * that shape sets it explicitly). There is deliberately no longer a store
 * subscription enforcing either combination: unlike pre-#5893, nothing
 * about the active tool should ever rewrite `sectionPlane` or `sceneState`
 * out from under an explicit `setState`.
