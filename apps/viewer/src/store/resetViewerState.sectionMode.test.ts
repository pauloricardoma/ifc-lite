/**
 * Issue #2939: "a section position is pre-chosen from stale cache."
 *
 * `SectionPanel.tsx` restores the section tool's last-used mode from
 * `localStorage` (`ifc-lite:section-last-mode`, `sectionSlice.ts`'s
 * `loadLastSectionMode`) whenever the panel mounts. For a 'cardinal' entry
 * that restore includes `position` — a percentage along the LOADED MODEL's
 * bounding box, i.e. geometry, not a UI preference. It is only meaningful
 * relative to whichever model was on screen when it was saved.
 *
 * That entry lives in `localStorage`, so it survives closing the browser —
 * unlike the in-memory `sectionPlane.axis/position/flipped` fields, which
 * `resetViewerState()` already resets to defaults on every new file load
 * (`store/index.ts`, "Section plane" block). Before this fix,
 * `resetViewerState()` never touched the localStorage copy: opening the
 * section tool on a freshly loaded, UNRELATED model would read yesterday's
 * cardinal position back out of storage and apply it immediately — the
 * tool looked like it "pre-chose" a cut instead of arming face-pick mode.
 *
 * This is a real, unmocked `useViewerStore` (not a hand-rolled slice mock)
 * combined with a real `window.localStorage` (via `@/test/setup-dom.js`),
 * driving the actual persistence layer end to end: save a cardinal mode as
 * if a session with "model A" had set one, then call `resetViewerState()`
 * — the exact function every primary file load invokes before loading
 * "model B" — and confirm the stale entry cannot be read back.
