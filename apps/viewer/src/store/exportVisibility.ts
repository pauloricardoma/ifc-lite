/**
 * Single resolver for "what does visible-only export mean for this model".
 *
 * Before this existed, `ExportDialog.tsx` (STEP / IFCX) and
 * `GLBExportDialog.tsx` (GLB) each hand-assembled their own idea of "hidden"
 * / "isolated" from a subset of the store — `hiddenEntities` and
 * `isolatedEntities` only. Neither read `classFilter` (the hierarchy panel's Class tab),
 * `selectedStoreys` (storey isolation), or `typeVisibility` for STEP/IFCX at
 * all. Result (#4328): filter the Class tab to `IfcWallStandardCase`, export
 * "Visible Only", and the whole model comes out — the class filter is
 * invisible to every exporter.
 *
 * `getVisibleGlobalIds` in `basketVisibleSet.ts` already resolves the FULL
 * combination correctly for the basket/pinboard feature, and
 * `computeIsolationFilterSet` (also there) is already the shared derivation
 * `view-pdf-export-source.ts` routes through for the to-scale PDF export
 * (#2042/#2558 — the same "export disagrees with the viewport" defect
 * class). This resolver reuses `computeIsolationFilterSet` rather than
 * restating the storey/class/isolate intersection a third time, and adds the
 * channel neither of those covers for an entity-id-based exporter:
 * `typeVisibility` (class-level toggles — Spaces/Openings/Site/…).
 *
 * ## Composition ruling
 * Hidden and isolated compose as denylist-minus / allowlist-and: an entity
 * exports only if it is NOT in the hidden (denylist) set AND — when an
 * isolation allowlist is active — IS in that allowlist. Within the allowlist
 * side, storey selection, the class filter and manual "Isolate" all
 * INTERSECT, matching `computeIsolationFilterSet` (the viewport's own
 * isolation rule): a user who isolates a storey and then filters to a class
 * expects the overlap ("just the walls on this storey"), not the union
 * ("this storey, plus every wall anywhere"). The store's own doc comment
 * ("combinable") does not say which operator; the viewport's existing
 * behavior is the tie-breaker, since an export that disagreed with the
 * on-screen result would just be a different flavor of #4328.
 *
 * ## Structural entities
 * This resolver does not — and must not — decide whether `IfcProject`,
 * `IfcSite`, storeys, or relationships survive a visible-only export. The
 * STEP/IFCX exporters already retain infrastructure (`INFRASTRUCTURE_TYPES`)
 * and spatial structure (`SPATIAL_STRUCTURE_TYPES`) as unconditional roots
 * regardless of `hiddenEntityIds`/`isolatedEntityIds`
 * (`packages/export/src/entity-type-sets.ts`, `reference-collector.ts`) —
 * only `PRODUCT_TYPES` are filtered. This resolver only has to get the
 * product-level hidden/isolated sets right; the exporters' own root
 * classification takes it from there.
 *
 * ## `ghostExceptEntities` is deliberately excluded
 * It drives the renderer's X-Ray mode — every entity NOT in the set renders
 * TRANSLUCENT, not hidden (`VisibilitySlice.ghostExceptEntities` doc). A
 * ghosted-but-not-hidden entity is still on screen and must still export;
 * folding it in here would make "Export Visible Only" drop entities the user
 * can currently see.
 *
 * ## Every export path routes through this — with one deliberate exception
 * STEP, IFCX, merged STEP and GLB (`ExportDialog.tsx`, `GLBExportDialog.tsx`)
 * call this resolver directly. The SDK/scripting surface
 * (`sdk.export.ifc()`, `export-adapter.ts`'s `resolveVisibilityFilterSets`)
 * routes through it too, but ONLY when the caller's `refs` cover the whole
 * model — that is the same "visible only" question this resolver answers
 * for the dialogs. When a caller instead passes an explicit SUBSET of refs
 * (`sdk.export.ifc([wallA, wallB], ...)`), that adapter deliberately does
 * NOT consult this resolver: an explicit selection is a different question
 * ("export exactly these entities") than "what does visible-only mean for
 * the whole model", and must not be broadened or narrowed by whatever the
 * Class tab or storey isolation happen to be set to. See
 * `resolveVisibilityFilterSets`'s own doc in `export-adapter.ts` for that
 * composition.
