 * Customize sidebar, command palette) calls this, so "reset" always means
 * the whole workspace. Previously it reset only the sidebar, and floating
 * panels (the ones that end up off screen) were cleared only by the
 * close-all shortcut.
 *
 * Resets: the sidebar (mode, width, order, hidden panels, split), every
 * floating panel, the hierarchy pane (expanded on desktop, default width) and the
 * bottom strip's height. The last two live in components; they follow
 * `layoutResetEpoch`.
