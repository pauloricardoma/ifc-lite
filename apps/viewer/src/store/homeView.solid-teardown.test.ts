/**
 * Regression for the #2574 adversarial re-review
 * (https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/pull/2574#issuecomment-5306157639):
 * `resetVisibilityForHomeFromStore()` (the Home button / "Show all" reset)
 * resets selection, isolation, ghost, pair colours, the contact overlay and
 * `clashSelectedId` by hand — the same fields `useClash.clearHighlight()`
 * resets — but was written before the on-demand intersection-solid feature
 * landed and never learned about it. `Viewport.tsx` renders the solid purely
 * off `clashSolidStatus === 'solid' && clashSolidMesh`. If this reset doesn't
 * drop the solid presentation, an opaque intersection-solid mesh (plus, if in
 * flight, a since-superseded compute that can still land) keeps rendering
 * after the user clicks Home / "Show all", with the rest of the model back to
 * fully visible/opaque and nothing selected.
 *
 * This seeds the store exactly as `useClash.solid-invalidation.test.tsx` does
 * for `run()`/`runDuplicates()` (a resolved solid + full-model ghost, as
 * `focusClash` leaves it — useClash.ts L487-L533), then calls the REAL
 * `resetVisibilityForHomeFromStore()` and asserts the solid presentation is
 * gone afterward.
