 * Collaboration slice (M1 scaffolding).
 *
 * Owns the live `CollabSession`, the local ephemeral identity, the resolved
 * access role, and the presence roster. This is the viewer-side counterpart
 * to `@ifc-lite/collab`; see `docs/guide/collaboration.md` for the feature and
 * `docs/architecture/collab-plan.md` for the design.
 *
 * What this scaffolding wires up today:
 *   - identity bootstrap (accountless, persisted handle + color),
 *   - session lifecycle (`startCollab` / `stopCollab`),
 *   - status + presence subscriptions feeding the store.
 *
 * What it deliberately stubs for later milestones (TODOs inline):
 *   - `seedFromStep` model seeding into the Y.Doc (plan §4.2, M1),
 *   - mutation binding + remote→local apply (plan §7.5, M2),
 *   - presence overlay mounting in the viewport (plan §7.4 — done at mount
 *     time in the viewport component, not here).
