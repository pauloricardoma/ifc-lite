/**
 * First slice of github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2802: `collabSlice` is
 * 1300 lines wired into the store and, until this file, **no test called
 * `createCollabSlice` at all**. Replacing `get().activeModelId` with a garbage
 * literal left 60/60 green and `tsc` clean.
 *
 * That matters more here than the line count suggests. This is the slice the
 * #2790 outage lived in — a failed share reported success for weeks — and the
 * two things covered here are the ones other code TRUSTS:
 *
 *   - `canCollabEdit` / `canCollabComment` are the authorisation answer
 *     `mutationSlice` gates every write on. Wrong in the permissive direction
 *     and a viewer-role user accumulates local edits that never reach the room;
 *     wrong in the restrictive direction and single-user editing breaks
 *     entirely.
 *   - every `mirror*` is documented "no-ops without an active session". Nothing
 *     tested that, and it is what makes them safe to call unconditionally from
 *     the mutation path in single-user mode.
 *
 * The async half (`startCollab`'s session lifecycle, the recipient reconstruct)
 * still has no coverage and is not attempted here: it needs a live
 * `CollabSession`. This file deliberately takes the synchronous surface that
 * needs no session, rather than claiming the whole slice.
