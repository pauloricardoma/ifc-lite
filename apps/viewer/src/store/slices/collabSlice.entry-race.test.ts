/**
 * MAJOR (CodeRabbit CLI, PR #2706 review): fail closed when `startCollab`
 * runs with no active model.
 *
 * `ShareDialog` awaits `mintRoomToken()` and does not re-check cancellation
 * before calling `startCollab`. If the user removes the last model during
 * that await, `startCollab` is invoked with `activeModelId === null`. This
 * file drives the REAL `startCollab` (collabSlice.ts) under exactly that
 * precondition — not a stand-in — and pins its synchronous prefix:
 *
 *   const roomModelId = seed ? get().activeModelId : reconstructedModelId;
 *   set({ ..., collabRoomId: roomId, collabRoomModelId: roomModelId, ... });
 *
 * runs BEFORE any await, so by the time `startCollab` returns control to its
 * caller, `collabRoomId` (live-session marker) is already set while
 * `collabRoomModelId` is null. `room-model-target.ts`'s resolvers must fail
 * closed in that state — pinned separately, behaviourally, in
 * `room-model-target.test.ts` and `room-model-gate.test.ts`.
 *
 * What this does NOT drive: `ShareDialog`'s own missing cancellation check
 * (that the effect calls `startCollab` at all after the model disappeared),
 * or the rest of `startCollab` past the first `await import('@ifc-lite/collab')`
 * — the collab runtime needs IndexedDB/websocket wiring this harness does not
 * set up, and is irrelevant here: the corruption in `roomModelIdOf` et al. is
 * fully determined by the synchronous prefix pinned below, which does not
 * depend on session bring-up succeeding or failing.
