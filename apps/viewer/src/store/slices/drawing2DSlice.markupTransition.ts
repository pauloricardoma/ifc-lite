/**
 * THE single choke point every `activeModelId` transition that has
 * consequences for 2D drawing markup must go through (#4159 bug 5).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 * `measure2DResults` and its four siblings are flat, federation-wide store
 * fields — not scoped per model — so whatever they hold is only meaningful
 * for whichever model is CURRENTLY active. Three shipped rounds of this issue
 * all trace back to the same shape: more than one place can move
 * `activeModelId`, and each one had to independently remember to clear/carry
 * the five fields along with it. `modelSlice.ts`'s `setActiveModel` got it
 * right (bugs 2 and 4). `modelSlice.teardown.ts`'s `'model-removed'` arm —
 * the ONLY other place `activeModelId` moves in production — did not: it
 * writes `activeModelId: scope.nextActiveModelId` directly, and
 * `drawing2DSlice.teardown.ts`'s own `'model-removed'` arm was `notApplicable`
 * (a deliberate no-op for the "removed model is not the active one" case,
 * but silently ALSO a no-op for "removed model IS the active one", which is
 * bug 5). `lib/sources/syncSourceModel.ts` calls the same `removeModel`
 * action, so it inherited the identical hole — see that module's own comment
 * for the concrete failure it produces when the model being synced is the
 * active one.
 *
 * Rather than teach the teardown arm the same clear-and-suppress incantation
 * `setActiveModel` uses (a FOURTH copy of the convention this class of bug
 * keeps breaking), both now call the ONE function below.
 *
 * A later pass (#4159 bug 3) found a THIRD production writer this doc
 * previously missed: `modelSlice.ts`'s `addModel`, in its
 * `state.models.size === 0` branch, sets `activeModelId: model.id` directly
 * when the very first model of a session (or of a post-`clearAllModels`
 * federation) is added. That branch now also calls `markupTransitionPatch`.
 *
 * A still later pass (#4159 bug 6) found a FOURTH: `modelSlice.ts`'s
 * `upsertModel` resolves `activeModelId` as `state.activeModelId ?? model.id`
 * — the identical "adopt the first model of the session" shape `addModel`
 * has — and wrote it directly. Routed in `modelSlice.upsert.ts` (a sibling
 * module, not inline, for the same module-size reason as this file).
 *
 * This doc has now named the complete set wrong twice — first two writers,
 * then three — each time by writing "the ONLY other place" or "all N" before
 * the next review round found one more. So the honest claim is narrower:
 * **these four writers** — `modelSlice.ts`'s `setActiveModel`, `addModel` and
 * `upsertModel`, and `modelSlice.teardown.ts`'s `'model-removed'` arm — are
 * everywhere `activeModelId` moves in the PRODUCTION action layer as of this
 * writing, each confirmed by grepping every `activeModelId:` write and every
 * `useViewerStore.setState()` call under `apps/viewer/src` (excluding tests)
 * at the time this paragraph was written, and each now calls
 * `markupTransitionPatch` in the same `set()` that moves the id. That is a
 * property of the action layer, enforced by convention and this file's own
 * review history, not a guarantee this file — or any grep — can make
 * permanent: nothing stops a FIFTH writer from being added tomorrow with the
 * same field-write shape and no compiler or lint signal pointing here. A
 * caller reaching `useViewerStore.setState()` directly bypasses this
 * regardless of how many production call sites currently behave — see "What
 * this does NOT eliminate" below.
 *
 * ## The in-session live cache
 * Beyond closing bug 5, this also strengthens bug 4's fix: an in-memory,
 * session-scoped `Map<modelId, fields>` remembers each model's live markup
 * the moment it stops being active. Switching BACK to a model visited earlier
 * this session restores that snapshot synchronously, in the SAME `set()` call
 * that moves `activeModelId` — a real, immediate restore, not a
 * clear-to-defaults that waits on `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts`'s async,
 * content-hash-keyed `localStorage` lookup to paper over it a tick later.
 *
 * That hook is DELIBERATELY untouched by this file and keeps running exactly
 * as before (see its own doc) — it owns `sectionConfig` (which this cache
 * does not carry) and remains the authority for a model's FIRST activation
 * this session, when nothing is cached here yet. Its unconditional clear +
 * hash-keyed reload, run again immediately after a cache-hit restore, is
 * therefore redundant but not harmful: the hash is already resolved for any
 * model this cache remembers (it cannot hold an entry for a model whose own
 * activation never ran the hook's hash lookup), so the reload is synchronous
 * and settles on the same data this module already restored — see
 * `drawing2DSlice.markupTransition.test.ts` and
 * `useDrawing2DPersistence.test.tsx` for the interaction pinned end to end.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT eliminate
 * A caller that changes `activeModelId` via `useViewerStore.setState()`
 * directly — bypassing both `setActiveModel` and `removeModel` — still
 * bypasses this too; nothing in Zustand can prevent that from outside the
 * store. `useDrawing2DPersistence.ts`'s own doc already names that same
 * limitation for the pre-existing suppression mechanism this builds on. What
 * changed here is that the PRODUCTION call graph now has exactly one correct
 * implementation instead of an easy-to-forget copy at every call site.
 *
 * ## In-progress and selection state (#4196, #4199)
 * This function's `Drawing2DMarkupPatch` return type originally covered only
 * the five COMMITTED fields above — never the in-progress placement
 * (`polygonArea2DPoints`, `cloudAnnotation2DPoints`, `measure2DStart`/
 * `measure2DCurrent`) or the live `selectedAnnotation2D`/
 * `textAnnotation2DEditing`. A half-drawn polygon spanning two coordinate
 * frames computed a plausible but wrong area on `completePolygonArea2D`, and
 * a `selectedAnnotation2D` could dangle at an id absent from the new model's
 * arrays, making Delete a silent no-op. `inProgressClearPatch()` below closes
 * this by clearing those six on every real transition this function handles
 * — never cached, never restored, unlike the five committed fields.
 * `annotation2DActiveTool` is deliberately excluded: see that function's doc.
 *
 * #4199 (this PR's own review) found the same bug class a SIXTH time inside
 * the PR meant to end it: `measure2DSnapPoint` and `annotation2DCursorPos`
 * are both frame-dependent `Point2D | null` fields — consumed for rendering
 * as `measureSnapPoint`/`annotation2DCursorPos` props in `drawing/DrawingCanvasView.tsx`
 * — that were on `Drawing2DState` before this file's `#4196` pass and were
 * missed by it: neither the five committed fields nor the original six
 * in-progress fields covered them. A snap indicator or cursor preview
 * computed in the outgoing model's drawing coordinates would render at the
 * wrong place over the incoming model's drawing until the next mouse-move.
 * They are now the seventh and eighth fields `inProgressClearPatch()` clears.
 *
 * That is EIGHT fields, hand-picked by `Drawing2DTransitionClearPatch`
 * below, in a file that has now undercounted its own field list six times.
 * `FIELD_CLASSIFICATION` right below makes a seventh recurrence a compile
 * error instead of a silent gap: it is `satisfies Record<keyof
 * Drawing2DState, ...>`, so TypeScript refuses to build the moment
 * `Drawing2DState` gains a key this file hasn't classified. See the two
 * exported symbols immediately below for how the in-progress type and the
 * classification stay provably in sync with each other, not just with
 * `Drawing2DState`.

/**
 * How this file treats EVERY key of `Drawing2DState` on an `activeModelId`
 * transition — the structural fix for the recurring bug class named in the
 * module doc (six rounds, most recently #4199 finding two more fields this
 * same PR had missed).
 *
 * - `'committed'`: cached per model in `liveMarkupCache` and restored on
 *   revisit — {@link Drawing2DMarkupPatch}'s five fields, owned by
 *   `drawing2DSlice.persistence.ts`.
 * - `'in-progress'`: frame-dependent or id-referencing state that is never
 *   cached and never restored — always reset by
 *   {@link inProgressClearPatch} on every real transition. See the module
 *   doc for why: it is expressed in, or references ids scoped to, the
 *   OUTGOING model.
 * - `'preserved'`: everything else. Not touched by the returned patch at
 *   all — a session-wide UI preference (e.g. `annotation2DActiveTool`, see
 *   its own doc) or drawing-generation state owned by a different code path.
 *
 * The `satisfies Record<keyof Drawing2DState, ...>` below is the actual
 * guard: it is a TYPE ERROR, not a lint warning or a convention, for
 * `Drawing2DState` to gain a key this object does not list. A field added
 * there with no row here fails the build before it can ship uncleared.
