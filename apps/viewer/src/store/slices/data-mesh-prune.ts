/**
 * Drop drained mesh-removal ids out of `geometryResult.meshes` and subtract
 * their triangle/vertex counts from the running totals (issue #4874).
 *
 * `useGeometryStreaming` calls this right after `scene.removeMeshesForEntities`
 * — the renderer-side hard removal — so the STORE copy stops disagreeing with
 * the scene. Several consumers read that array or those totals directly:
 * picking, bounds recomputation, `StatusBar`'s triangle readout, and
 * `lib/collab/geometry-sync.ts`'s independent re-sum.
 *
 * Matches on which meshes are actually PRESENT for `ids`, not on `ids.size`:
 * draining the same id twice (already pruned), or naming an id that never had
 * a mesh, removes and subtracts nothing rather than double-counting or driving
 * a total negative.
 *
 * Owning model: the queue carries renderer GLOBAL ids with no model id, and a
 * removal can belong to a model that is not active (3D picking selects in any
 * federated model without calling `setActiveModel`, and split/delete act on
 * that selection's `modelId`). Every model's `geometryResult.meshes` already
 * holds global ids (`applyFederationOffsetToMesh` at load, `toGlobalIdFromModels`
 * for authored meshes), and offset ranges are disjoint, so this prunes EVERY
 * geometry that holds a queued id: the active mirror and each model's own.
 *
 * Renderer parity: `Scene.removeMeshesForEntity` (packages/renderer/src/scene.ts)
 * keeps a mesh only when `hostsOtherEntities` says its `entityIds` name OTHER
 * entities, and tombstones an instanced entity. This uses the same predicate, so
 * an authored element's mesh (`entityIds` holding only its own id) is pruned,
 * a genuinely colour-merged one is kept, and the id also leaves the
 * instanced-only metadata maps (hashes, AABBs, volumes).
 *
 * Bounded mode:`releaseGeometryMemory` empties a mesh's buffers but keeps the
 * mesh and its share of the totals, so counts come from `meshGeometryCounts`,
 * which falls back to the counts retained at release.
 *
 * Rotated models: a whole-model yaw is baked into the vertices and the pristine
 * copy lives in the rotation baseline, which is keyed by MESH OBJECT and holds
 * the model's pristine extent (`lib/model-placement/rotation-baseline.ts`).
 * That copy outlives the mesh unless this prune tells the baker about it, so
 * the drain ends with `ModelRotationBaker.pruneMeshes` (#4935).
