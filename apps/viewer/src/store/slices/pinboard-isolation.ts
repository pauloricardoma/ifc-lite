/**
 * The basket's relationship to the shared `isolatedEntities` channel — pure
 * helpers for `pinboardSlice.ts` (#4527).
 *
 * `isolatedEntities` is one `Set<number> | null` written by several owners
 * (basket, direct isolate, BCF viewpoint restore, lens, search). The basket API
 * is incremental: `addToBasket` widens whatever is isolated and
 * `removeFromBasket` narrows it — so it must know which ids IT put there. That
 * record is `BasketIsolationOwnership`, the basket's instance of the repo-wide
 * ownership convention in `lib/visibility/ownership.ts`:
 *
 *  - `ids`    the channel content as the basket last wrote it. Ownership is
 *             judged BY VALUE (`ownsCurrentVisibility`): if another writer has
 *             since replaced the channel, the basket no longer owns it and its
 *             claims are void — the invalidation middleware
 *             (`store/visibility-invalidation.ts`) nulls the record on such a
 *             write, and every helper here re-checks before trusting it.
 *  - `claims` the ids the basket itself inserted (absent from the channel when
 *             pinned). An id that was already isolated by someone else when it
 *             was pinned is NOT claimed, so unpinning it leaves it isolated.
 *  - `seeded` whether the basket turned `null` into a Set — i.e. opened the
 *             isolation channel and may close it again when it empties. Not
 *             derivable from `claims`: a basket added onto a restored
 *             empty-but-active isolate (#4509) claims everything yet did not
 *             open the channel.
