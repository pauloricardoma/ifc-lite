/**
 * A server-loaded model must carry the real `IfcRel*` express id on every
 * relationship edge (issue #3860).
 *
 * The server payload gained a `rel_id` column; before it, the viewer's server
 * path fed the relationship graph a hard-coded 0, so `RelId` in a Parquet or
 * DuckDB export of a server-loaded model was 0 on every row while a locally
 * parsed model of the same file carried the real id. `RelId` is read from the
 * graph's `edgeRelIds`, which is exactly what the assertions below read
 * through, so this pins the value the export writes.
 *
 * The fixture's rel ids (900/901/902) are disjoint from every relating and
 * related id, so a copy of a neighbouring column fails as loudly as the old
 * constant 0.
