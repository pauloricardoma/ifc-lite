/**
 * Helpers for IFC decomposition (`IfcRelAggregates`).
 *
 * An assembly — `IfcElementAssembly`, an `IfcStair`/`IfcRoof`/`IfcRamp` used as
 * a container, a wall with `IfcBuildingElementPart`s — carries no geometry of
 * its own; its parts (stair flights, railings, landing slabs, virtual clearance
 * volumes, …) hang off it via `IfcRelAggregates` and hold the actual meshes.
 * The spatial hierarchy only records the assembly as a leaf contained in its
 * storey, so the parts are invisible to anything that walks the tree (the
 * spatial panel, storey isolation, assembly selection). These helpers recover
 * the parts straight from the relationship graph, which both fresh parses and
 * cache loads retain (issue #1133).

 * Does `rootId` — or any of its `IfcRelAggregates` descendants — carry geometry?

 * The 3D-oriented trees (By Class, By Type) drop every entity absent from
 * `geometricIds`, which discards an assembly whose meshes all live on its parts:
 * the assembly is renderable, just not under its own id. This is the predicate
 * that admits exactly that case while still rejecting a container with neither
 * geometry nor geometry-bearing parts (issue #1133 applied beyond the spatial
 * tree).
 *
 * Short-circuits on the first geometry-bearing descendant, is cycle-guarded, and
 * takes an optional `cache` so a whole-model scan stays roughly linear instead
 * of re-walking shared subtrees once per entity. The cache is keyed by express
 * id, so it is only valid for ONE model's relationship graph and one
 * `geometricIds` snapshot — allocate a fresh one per model per tree rebuild.

/**
 * Replace every id in `globalIds` that has no renderable geometry with ALL of
 * its aggregated descendants.
 *
 * Two use cases, both solved by the same full expansion:
 *
 * 1. Framing: the class trees ask each selected id for a bounding box and skip
 *    it when there is none — so selecting a geometry-less assembly and pressing
 *    Frame moves the camera nowhere. Expanding makes an assembly frame as the
 *    union of its parts.
 *
 * 2. Presentation channels: `hasGeometry` is a point-in-time check — during
 *    streaming or behind a type-visibility filter, it says "no" for a part that
 *    legitimately has geometry and simply hasn't rendered YET (#3426, #3865).
 *    Persisting only currently-meshed parts means parts that stream in later
 *    escape the action. Always including the full descendant set ensures the
 *    persisted action applies to all parts, present and future. Carrying an id
 *    with no mesh is free: it simply never matches a renderer's mesh whitelist.
 *
 *    This buys HIDE and ISOLATE, and only those two. Both are whitelists the
 *    renderer re-matches mesh ids against, so a mesh-less id in the persisted
 *    set starts matching the moment its mesh lands. COLOUR was different
 *    while `scene.setColorOverrides` built overlay batches once from
 *    `meshDataMap`: a part whose mesh arrived after the flush was never
 *    painted, which the #3890 catch-up fixed by re-applying on the geometry
 *    tick. Since #6076 the renderer paints by id from a per-entity colour
 *    table, so an installed colour reaches a late mesh without re-application.
 *
 * Ids that already have geometry pass through untouched and in order. An id
 * with neither geometry nor ANY aggregated descendant at all is dropped — that
 * is the one case this function genuinely cannot help with, because there is
 * nothing to expand to.
 *
 * Resolution stays inside one model: descendants are mapped back through the
 * SAME model's offset.
