/**
 * The last-load snapshot behind the device-loss report (#2624).
 *
 * The trap these tests pin (found in review on #2643): `useIfcLoader.ts` has
 * SIX completing load paths that capture `ifc_model_loaded` (point-cloud,
 * ifcx, glb, cache-hit, server, local wasm), and originally only the wasm one
 * recorded the snapshot. After a cache-hit or server load - the server path is
 * on by default - the module-level snapshot still held the PREVIOUS model's
 * numbers, so a later GPU loss shipped `last_load_*` fields describing a
 * different model than the one on the device. Stale numbers mislead triage
 * worse than absent ones, which inverts the point of the enrichment.
 *
 * Two halves make that impossible, and each has a test here:
 *  - fail-safe: every primary load CLEARS the snapshot at its start, so a
 *    path that records nothing (or a future seventh path) omits the fields;
 *  - per-path truth: every capture goes through `captureModelLoaded`, whose
 *    mandatory snapshot argument records that path's own numbers.
 * The second half holds by construction, not by a test: the
 * 'ifc_model_loaded' event name lives ONLY inside `captureModelLoaded`, so
 * emitting the event without stating a snapshot does not typecheck anywhere
 * in the codebase. These tests pin what that one seam does when called.
