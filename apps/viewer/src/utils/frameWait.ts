/**
 * Bounded "wait for the next frame".
 *
 * `requestAnimationFrame` is **not serviced while the document is hidden** —
 * the callback is queued and only runs when the tab is shown again. So a bare
 * `await new Promise(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(resolve))` inside an
 * async pipeline parks *for as long as the user stays on another tab*, which on
 * a long model load is routinely minutes and has been observed in field
 * telemetry at over a day.
 *
 * Every such wait in a background-capable pipeline must therefore be raced
 * against a timer. `useIDS` already did this by hand; this is the single home
 * for the pattern.
 *
 * The frame still wins whenever one arrives, so a visible tab behaves exactly
 * as it did before as long as `timeoutMs` is generous relative to a frame.
 *
 * Caveat, deliberately not worked around: browsers throttle timers in hidden
 * tabs (Chrome clamps to >=1s, and to ~1/minute after several minutes of
 * hiddenness). The fallback therefore bounds the stall rather than hitting
 * `timeoutMs` exactly — bounded-and-late is the goal, not precision.
 *
 * @param timeoutMs Upper bound on the wait. Must be > 0; a non-positive value
 *   would defeat the frame wait entirely and is rejected rather than silently
 *   turning every call site into "yield once".
