/**
 * A model loaded from the server must export its relationships, and must
 * answer for a repeated IfcRel exactly as a locally parsed one does (#3827).
 *
 * `buildRelationships` used to hand-roll a `RelationshipEdges` facade whose
 * `offsets`, `counts` and `edge*` arrays were empty, with the real edges
 * hidden behind the `getEdges` closure. Every consumer that walks a CSR half
 * through `offsets` -- the Parquet `Relationships` table here, the DuckDB
 * `relationships` table in `@ifc-lite/query` -- therefore saw a graph with no
 * edges at all and silently emitted zero rows. The facade also collected
 * edges itself, so any repeated-edge handling in `RelationshipGraphBuilder`
 * never reached the server path.
 *
 * The fixture repeats one IfcRel line, which is schema-legal: nothing in
 * EXPRESS forbids two `IfcRel*` instances naming the same (relating, related)
 * pair. The parity assertion pins the server graph against the same edges fed
 * through `RelationshipGraphBuilder` directly, which is the WASM path's own
 * construction -- so whatever the builder does with a repeat, both paths do
 * the same thing, and they cannot drift apart again.
