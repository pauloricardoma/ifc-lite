/**
 * Modeling command framework: shared types (charter #6232, WP2).
 *
 * A modeling command is a small state machine over a gesture value `G`
 * (`init` → `pointerMove`/`pointerDown`/typed fields → `commit`). The command
 * never touches the store while the gesture runs: per-frame state lives in the
 * vanilla runtime (`runtime.ts`), and a commit runs inside ONE
 * `AuthoringTransaction` (`transaction.ts`), which is one undo step.
