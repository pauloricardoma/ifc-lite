/**
 * `room.place`'s gesture (charter #6232 M4). Its own module so the bar, the
 * scene and the plan layer read it without importing the command.
 *
 * Pick: hover a region bounded by walls, click to make it a room.
 * Draw: a free room outlined with the slab gesture — a rectangle from two
 * corners, or a polygon (Enter, a double-click or a click back on the first
 * corner closes it; Backspace drops the last).
 * Edit: reshape the storey's room layout : drag a
 * corner, cut a room between two points on its outline, and in Remove merge
 * two rooms across the wall between them or dissolve a corner. Each edit is
 * `action: 'edit'` with its `op`, one transaction.
 * The bar's Auto (this storey or all), Footprint, Update and Clean up
 * actions commit through the same command with `action` set, so each is one
 * transaction and one undo step.
