/**
 * "As displayed" scale derivation and page-size description for the to-scale
 * 3D-view PDF export (#2042).
 *
 * DEFECT CLASS 1 — the devicePixelRatio double count. The scale a viewport
 * "displays at" is a ratio between world metres and PHYSICAL paper millimetres,
 * and the browser's own physical-size reference is the CSS pixel: 96 CSS px is
 * one inch, by definition, on every display regardless of its backing-store
 * density. A canvas' `width`/`height` attributes are the BACKING STORE size,
 * conventionally `cssHeight * devicePixelRatio` (this viewport's canvas is
 * currently sized with no DPR factor, so the two coincide today; the rule
 * stands because that is a renderer detail this module must not depend on),
 * so a caller that measures those, or an
 * implementation that "corrects" a CSS measurement by `devicePixelRatio`,
 * reports a scale off by exactly the ratio — 1:151 printed on a sheet labelled
 * 1:76 on a Retina display. Nothing about the resulting PDF looks wrong; only
 * a ruler on the print disagrees. This module therefore takes CSS pixels only
 * and never reads `devicePixelRatio`, and its tests pin that the result does
 * not move when the global changes.
 *
 * DEFECT CLASS 2 — a page that silently exceeds what a PDF can express. The
 * page is sized to the drawing (`computePdfScaleLayout`), never fitted, so a
 * large site at 1:10 asks for metres of paper. PDF's user-space limit is
 * 14400 pt = 200 in = 5080 mm per side; past that a writer either clamps
 * (mis-scaling the very thing that was supposed to be exact) or emits a page a
 * reader refuses. `describePage` surfaces both the nearest ISO sheet that
 * CONTAINS the page and the oversize verdict, so the dialog can warn before
 * anything is written.
