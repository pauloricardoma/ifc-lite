/**
 * The page size the to-scale 3D-view PDF export will need, computed BEFORE any
 * line work exists (#2042).
 *
 * DEFECT CLASS — a dialog that offers a scale it cannot print. The page is
 * sized to the drawing, never fitted to a sheet (see `pdf-scale.ts`), so 1:10
 * on a site model asks for metres of paper and blows past PDF's 5080 mm user-
 * space limit; past that a writer either clamps — mis-scaling the one thing the
 * export exists to get right — or emits a page a reader refuses. The user has
 * to learn that BEFORE waiting through a generate, which means the readout
 * cannot depend on the generator's output.
 *
 * So this projects the eight corners of the visible geometry's world AABB
 * through the SAME camera basis the export uses (`buildCameraSectionPlane` +
 * `projectPointForPlane`) and lays them out with the SAME
 * `computePdfScaleLayout`. That makes the estimate an exact UPPER BOUND on the
 * real page: the drawing's own 2D bounds are the extent of geometry inside that
 * box, so they can only be smaller, and a section cut only removes geometry.
 * Callers must present it as an estimate and report the real page size after
 * the export — an estimate quietly labelled as fact is its own defect.
 *
 * Deliberately synchronous and free of the generator, jsPDF and the store: the
 * dialog recomputes it on every scale keystroke.
