/**
 * #4937 — what IFC export offers for a LandXML model, and why.
 *
 * Before v1 of the mapping this was a blanket refusal, so the only thing a
 * test could check was that the button stayed disabled. The interesting cases
 * are now the ones in between: a model the mapping covers in part must still
 * export while NAMING what it leaves out, and a model it cannot cover at all
 * must still refuse. §6 of `docs/architecture/landxml-to-ifc-mapping.md`.
