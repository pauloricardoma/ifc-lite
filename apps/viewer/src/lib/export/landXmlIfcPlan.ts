/**
 * What IFC export can and cannot do with the LandXML models currently in
 * scope (#4937).
 *
 * Until v1 of the mapping, `canExportIfc` was a blanket `false` for any
 * LandXML source. It is now "the loaded records are covered by the mapping",
 * which is a question with three answers, not two: fully covered, covered in
 * part, or not covered at all. §6 of
 * `docs/architecture/landxml-to-ifc-mapping.md` requires that the middle case
 * still export while stating, by record family and before the user commits,
 * what will be left out — a silent partial is the one outcome the mapping
 * rules out.
 *
 * The plan is computed WITHOUT building the file: `collectRefusals` and
 * `isMappableSurface` read the parsed document directly, so the dialog can
 * show it on every keystroke of the model selector.
