/**
 * github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite/issues/2719: a recipient's `maxExpressId` was
 * captured on the FIRST reconstruct and never moved again.
 *
 * The chain, each link verified against the code: `collabSlice` computed the
 * bound only inside `if (!modelCreated)`; the re-derive branch called only
 * `setIfcDataStore`, which writes `{...model, ifcDataStore}` and leaves the
 * bound alone; the IFCX re-derive re-allocates dense ids from 1
 * (`entity-extractor.ts`), so a peer's newly created entity lands above the
 * frozen bound; and `globalId.ts` gates resolution on
 * `localExpressId <= model.maxExpressId`. Net effect: everything a peer added
 * after the joiner's first reconstruct silently stopped resolving.
 *
 * The bound's movement rule is the part worth pinning, because it is wrong in
 * BOTH directions: frozen loses new entities, and tracking the count exactly
 * would break ids already handed out when a peer deletes something.
