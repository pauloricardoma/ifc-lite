/**
 * The owner's seed-into-room (plan §4.6), lifted out of `collabSlice.startCollab`.
 *
 * Runs once the session has synced, once per model of the share scope, each
 * into the room slot `startCollab` assigned it (#4444), preserving one store
 * and geometry set per loaded model.
 *
 * Independent structure and geometry guards keep re-seeding safe and let a
 * partially seeded room backfill its content-addressed geometry.
 *
 * A room that holds entities but no slot records was shared before slots
 * existed; nothing is seeded into it (an owner never re-shares into an old
 * room — every share mints a fresh room id — so this is a guard, not a path).
 *
 * Reports progress through `onPhase` / `onProgress` and returns the settled
 * phase (#4446): the slice mirrors it into `collabSeedPhase`
 * so the Share dialog can hold the invite back until the room actually holds
 * every model. "Holds" means the relay holds it: after the last local write
 * the seed asks `confirmRelay` whether the server's state vector covers the
 * owner's (`'confirming'`), because a local transaction only proves the bytes
 * are queued in the browser's socket — a tab closed right then loses them and
 * the next joiner reconstructs an empty room. Every store write stays in the
 * slice; this module only computes.
 *
 * The collab runtime is injected (never imported at module scope) so the
 * feature stays code-split — see the import note in collabSlice.ts.
