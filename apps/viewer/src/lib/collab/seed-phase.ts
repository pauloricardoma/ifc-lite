/**
 * The initial model seed as explicit state, separate from connectivity (#4446).
 *
 * A connected websocket is not a seeded room. `collabStatus` flips to
 * `'connected'` the moment the provider handshakes, while the owner is still
 * uploading structure and geometry into it — and `collabRoomId` is set even
 * earlier, synchronously, before any await. A Share dialog keyed on either of
 * those handed out invites to rooms that were still empty; whoever opened one
 * reconstructed nothing.
 *
 * This is the product-level answer to "is the room ready to be shared?", so no
 * UI has to inspect the Y.Doc (or `collabSession`, which is only committed
 * after the seed) to find out. Recipients never seed: for them the phase stays
 * `'none'`, which reads as ready.
