/**
 * Which model does a collab room's edits belong to?
 *
 * Every edit that crosses the room boundary — inbound (a peer's edit replayed
 * into a local `MutablePropertyView`) and outbound (a local edit mirrored into
 * the CRDT) — carries an expressId in the ROOM's id space. It is only
 * meaningful against the room's model. The edit paths resolved that model as
 * "whatever is active": `activeModelId` for the inbound view and the outbound
 * gate, and the top-level `ifcDataStore` (which tracks the active model) for
 * path resolution.
 *
 * The active model is not the room model. `upsertModel` keeps the existing
 * `activeModelId` rather than switching to the model it creates
 * (modelSlice.ts), so a recipient who joins a room and then loads and selects
 * their own file — two clicks — has a different model active. From that point:
 *
 *   - a peer's edit was written into the USER'S OWN model's view, under an
 *     entityId from the room's id space. The inbound handlers call the view
 *     directly, so it does NOT reach `undoStacks` / `dirtyModels` (those are
 *     written only by `mutationSlice` actions). It lands in the view's overlay
 *     and its append-only `mutationHistory`, which is what the exporter and
 *     `getModifiedEntityCount` read — so it survives a reload, counts as a
 *     modified element and ships in their exported IFC;
 *   - the user's edits on their PRIVATE model were mirrored into the shared
 *     room and applied to whatever entity the id resolved to there, corrupting
 *     the owner's model for everyone.
 *
 * This module is the single place that answers the question, so the inbound
 * and outbound paths cannot drift apart again — they were two expressions of
 * the same rule, and that is what let one of them be wrong.
 *
 * The room model is an observation, not a policy: for an owner it is the model
 * that was seeded into the room (the one active when they pressed Share), for
 * a recipient it is the reconstructed `room:<roomId>`. Nothing here decides
 * what *should* happen when a user opens a second file mid-session, and
 * nothing here changes which model is active.
 *
 * Addressing follows `room-model-apply.ts`: name the room model by id, and use
 * the active-model value only as the pre-session fallback.
