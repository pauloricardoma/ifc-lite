/**
 * Which model does a collab room's edit belong to?
 *
 * Every edit that crosses the room boundary — inbound (a peer's edit replayed
 * into a local `MutablePropertyView`) and outbound (a local edit mirrored into
 * the CRDT) — carries an expressId in ONE model's id space. It is only
 * meaningful against that model. The edit paths used to resolve the model as
 * "whatever is active": `activeModelId` for the inbound view and the outbound
 * gate, and the top-level `ifcDataStore` (which tracks the active model) for
 * path resolution.
 *
 * The active model is not the room model. `upsertModel` keeps the existing
 * `activeModelId` rather than switching to the model it creates
 * (modelSlice.ts), so a recipient who joins a room and then loads and selects
 * their own file — two clicks — has a different model active. From that point:
 *
 *   - a peer's edit was written into the USER'S OWN model's view, under an
 *     entityId from the room's id space. The inbound handlers call the view
 *     directly, so it does NOT reach `undoStacks` / `dirtyModels` (those are
 *     written only by `mutationSlice` actions). It lands in the view's overlay
 *     and its append-only `mutationHistory`, which is what the exporter and
 *     `getModifiedEntityCount` read — so it survives a reload, counts as a
 *     modified element and ships in their exported IFC;
 *   - the user's edits on their PRIVATE model were mirrored into the shared
 *     room and applied to whatever entity the id resolved to there, corrupting
 *     the owner's model for everyone.
 *
 * A room holds one model per SLOT (#4444): the owner can share every loaded
 * model, and a recipient reconstructs one viewer model per slot. So "the room
 * model" is a set, `collabRoomModels` (viewer model id → slot), and every
 * resolver here is keyed by the model an edit names — outbound by the edited
 * `modelId`, inbound by the entity path, whose slot prefix names the model.
 * This module is the single place that answers the question, so the inbound
 * and outbound paths cannot drift apart again — they were two expressions of
 * the same rule, and that is what let one of them be wrong.
 *
 * The room models are an observation, not a policy: for an owner they are the
 * models that were seeded into the room (the share scope chosen in the Share
 * dialog), for a recipient the reconstructed `room:<roomId>:<slotId>` models.
 * Nothing here decides what *should* happen when a user opens another file
 * mid-session, and nothing here changes which model is active.
 *
 * Addressing follows `room-model-apply.ts`: name the room model by id, and use
 * the active-model value only as the pre-session fallback.

 * Store selection and the room gate are one decision, and this is the call that
 * makes them inseparable. Splitting them is worse than the bug they replace:
 * resolving a foreign expressId against the user's OWN store yields a path in
 * their own id space, which the room's document does not contain, so
 * `mirrorPlacement` fails closed on `hasEntity` and the edit is a silent
 * no-op. Resolving that same id against a ROOM model's store yields a REAL
 * path of the shared model — the room's `idToPath` is dense over its own ids —
 * so the write lands on an unrelated peer's entity, for everyone. A caller that
 * picks the right store and forgets the subject is armed, not fixed.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT fall back to the top-level `ifcDataStore` when the room
 * model is known but not registered yet — a recipient's `room:<roomId>:<slot>`
 * does not exist until the first reconstruct completes. Falling back there is
 * the defect: it resolves a room-id-space path against the user's own file.
 * Until the room model exists the correct answer is "no store", and the caller
 * drops the edit; the next reconstruct rebuilds the whole model from the CRDT
 * anyway, so nothing is lost. The `state.ifcDataStore` fallback below only
 * fires OFF a session.
