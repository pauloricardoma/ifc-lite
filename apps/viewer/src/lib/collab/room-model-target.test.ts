/**
 * Regression: a collab room's edits must target the ROOM's model in BOTH
 * directions, not whatever model happens to be active.
 *
 * Reachable in two clicks. `upsertModel` keeps the existing `activeModelId`
 * rather than switching to the model it creates, so a user who joins a room and
 * then loads and selects their own file has a different model active. From
 * there the edit paths, which resolved the room's model as "the active one",
 * did this:
 *
 *   - inbound: a peer's edit — an expressId in the ROOM's id space — was
 *     written into the USER'S OWN model's `MutablePropertyView`, landing in
 *     that view's overlay and append-only `mutationHistory` (not in
 *     `undoStacks` / `dirtyModels`, which only `mutationSlice` writes). The
 *     exporter and `getModifiedEntityCount` read it, so it survives a reload
 *     and ships in their exported IFC.
 *   - outbound: an edit on the user's PRIVATE model was mirrored into the
 *     shared room and applied to whatever entity the id resolved to there,
 *     corrupting the owner's model for everyone.
 *
 * The active-model tracking these tests turn on is the REAL thing: state is
 * built from `createModelSlice` + `createDataSlice` and driven through
 * `upsertModel` / `setActiveModel` / `setIfcDataStore`, so what is exercised is
 * the store's actual focus behaviour rather than a re-statement of it.
