/**
 * Regression: resolving a room edit against the ROOM's store is only safe when
 * the edit is ON the room's model. Store selection and the room gate are one
 * decision, not two.
 *
 * `room-model-target.test.ts` pins the first half — `roomStore` must name the
 * room's model rather than the active one. This file pins the half that makes
 * that safe, because getting the store right and the subject wrong is *worse*
 * than the bug it replaced:
 *
 *   - resolving against the user's OWN store yields a path in their own id
 *     space (`/MyWindow`). That path does not exist in the room's document, so
 *     `mirrorPlacement` fails closed on `hasEntity` and the edit is a silent
 *     no-op — wrong, but harmless.
 *   - resolving against the ROOM's store yields a REAL path of the shared model
 *     (`/OwnerWallB`) for that same expressId, because the room's `idToPath` is
 *     dense over its own ids. `hasEntity` now says yes, and an edit the user
 *     made on their PRIVATE model is written onto an unrelated peer's entity,
 *     for everyone.
 *
 * So every path that resolves through `roomStore` must first establish that the
 * model being edited IS the room's — which is what `roomStoreFor` does, as a
 * single call the caller cannot half-perform.
 *
 * The mechanism is exercised against the real collab document and the real
 * `mutation-bridge` (`pathForEntity`, `mirrorPlacement`), not a re-statement of
 * them, so what these tests turn on is the actual write path.
