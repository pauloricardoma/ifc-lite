/**
 * `confirmRelayHoldsState` (#4446): keeps asking the relay until its state
 * vector covers the owner's, backs off between probes, charges the
 * unreachable budget only to failing probes, caps the whole wait, stops the
 * moment the join is abandoned, and has nothing to confirm without a relay.
 * The cover check is the real `stateVectorCovers` over a real session's state
 * vector; only the socket read is scripted — a relay that catches up one
 * owner write per probe. (Each `set` of a fresh key is one Yjs struct, so a
 * client's clock after N such writes is N.)
