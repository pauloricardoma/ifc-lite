/**
 * The native evidence adapter contract (#6833, P01/P03). One adapter per
 * assistant source turns native store state into a bounded, frozen snapshot:
 *
 * - `readiness` is what the source picker shows live. It must be O(1)-ish:
 *   sizes and lengths, never a population walk.
 * - `identity` names the native result the snapshot was taken from. It is
 *   compared by reference (arrays element by element) on every store change
 *   while a question is in flight, so it must be cheap and must change when
 *   the native result is replaced.
 * - `reportStamp` is the run-time analysis stamp of a stored result
 *   (`stampAnalysisReport`), so a result that predates an edit is stale even
 *   if it is captured afterwards. Live sources recomputed on every edit omit it.
 * - `capture` returns native totals in `summary` (never recomputed from the
 *   sample), at most `limit` rows, the exact native `totalRows` and whether a
 *   native result existed at all. An available result with zero rows is
 *   "empty"; an unavailable one never means a completed check without findings.
 *
 * New adapters start every row with the common envelope (`evidenceRow`):
 * `kind`, and where the native source supplies them `modelId`, `globalId`,
 * `expressId`, `unit` and `status`. Unknown provenance stays absent or
 * explicitly `null`; it is never guessed. The five original adapters keep
 * their established row shapes, which saved conversations already contain.
