 * The one way to open Settings (#5857). Every opener (the ribbon's View tab,
 * the command palette, a button
 * that deep-links a section such as SpaceMouse) calls `openSettings`, and
 * `SettingsDialogHost` is the one listener. A window event rather than store
 * state keeps it callable from plain modules (palette command builders) and
 * matches the Info dialog's `EVENT_SHOW_SHORTCUTS`.
