/**
 * Revert-oracle witness for the Measurements panel's registration (#5502).
 * `MeasurementsPanel.test.tsx` covers the panel's own content, but that
 * production file is wholly new, so reverting the branch makes that suite
 * fail to LOAD rather than fail an assertion. `registry.ts` keeps compiling
 * after a revert (it only loses the union member and the array entry), so
 * this turns the revert into a plain, assertable data difference — the same
 * shape as `registry.environment-registration.test.ts` (#5506).
