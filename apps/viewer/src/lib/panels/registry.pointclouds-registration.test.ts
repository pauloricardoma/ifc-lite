/**
 * Revert-oracle witness for the Point Clouds side panel's registration
 * (#5507), same shape as `registry.cost-registration.test.ts` (#4858).
 *
 * `PointCloudPanel.i18n.test.tsx` and the ActivityBar/ViewportOverlays
 * suites below cover the panel's actual behaviour, but `PointCloudPanel.tsx`
 * itself predates this issue (it used to render as a floating card) — a
 * revert of #5507 does not delete that file, it only reverts the
 * `WorkspacePanelId` union member and the `WORKSPACE_PANELS` array entry
 * here. `registry.ts` stays free of heavy imports (only `lucide-react` icons
 * and type defs), so it keeps compiling either way — this test is what turns
 * "no longer lists 'pointclouds'" into an assertable failure.
