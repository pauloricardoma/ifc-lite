/**
 * The bottom strip's panels, as ONE table.
 *
 * Script / Schedule / Lists dock in the bottom strip, mutually exclusive,
 * each behind its own store flag (`scriptPanelVisible` and so on — the flags
 * predate the registry and other code reads them directly). Six places used
 * to spell that trio out by hand: three store actions, the layout's ternary,
 * the mobile sheet's precedence and the tour snapshot — and two of them
 * disagreed on the order in which a doubly-set flag wins. Adding a fourth
 * bottom panel meant finding all six, three of them at their module-size
 * budget. Now the id list, the flag names and the "which one is showing"
 * rule live here, and every reader derives from them (#3944).
 *
 * Order is precedence: when more than one flag is somehow on (the flag
 * setters are independent), the FIRST one here is what the strip shows.
