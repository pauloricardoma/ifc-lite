/**
 * Revert-oracle witness for the Environment panel's registration (#5506:
 * the docked side panel that replaced the floating "Sun & Sky" panel).
 *
 * `EnvironmentPanel.i18n.test.tsx` covers the panel's own rendered content,
 * but that production file is wholly new — reverting the branch deletes
 * `EnvironmentPanel.tsx` outright, so that suite dies at import
 * (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`) rather than failing an assertion. That is a load
 * failure, not a witness (see `registry.cost-registration.test.ts`, the same
 * shape for the Cost panel, #4858).
 *
 * `registry.ts` is the lighter of the two: its own docblock notes it is kept
 * "free of heavy imports" (only `lucide-react` icons and type defs) so that
 * `renderPanelBody` alone carries the panel-component weight. Reverting the
 * branch reverts its hunk too (the `WorkspacePanelId` union member and the
 * `WORKSPACE_PANELS` array entry), so the file keeps compiling — it just no
 * longer lists 'environment'. That turns the revert into a plain, assertable
 * data difference instead of a build break or a console-noise false negative.
