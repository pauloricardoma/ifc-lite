/**
 * Revert-oracle witness for the Placement panel's registration (#5505: the
 * docked side panel with Local / Georeference tabs that replaced the
 * floating `RepositionPanel` and the floating `CesiumPlacementEditor`).
 * Same reasoning `registry.environment-registration.test.ts` documents
 * (#5506) — `PlacementPanel.test.tsx` (via `LocalTab.test.tsx` /
 * `GeoreferenceTab.mapAbsolute.test.tsx`) covers rendered content, but those
 * production files are wholly new, so a revert kills that suite at import
 * rather than failing an assertion. `registry.ts` stays free of heavy
 * imports, so a revert of the branch's hunk here turns into a plain,
 * assertable data difference instead of a build break.
