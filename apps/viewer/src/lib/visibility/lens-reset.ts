 * What every Show all entry point (`showAllFromStore`) leaves in the hidden channel:
 * exactly the active lens's hides, preserving their existing ownership (#5877).
 *
 * A reset removes manual-only hides, but the lens stays active and keeps its
 * colours, so its hides must survive too. An id the user hid before the lens
 * matched it remains unowned, so deactivating the lens cannot reveal it.
 * With no active lens the channel is simply empty.
