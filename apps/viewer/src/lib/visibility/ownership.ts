/**
 * Who owns the SHARED visibility channels, expressed once.
 *
 * `isolatedEntities` / `ghostExceptEntities` (visibilitySlice) are shared by
 * clash, IDS, "Isolate in 3D" (#2532), assembly isolation (#2531),
 * `LayerDiffView`, Space Sketch's `useSpaceGhostPreview`, BCF and
 * `syncSourceModel`'s post-removal purge. A feature's teardown may therefore
 * only release a presentation IT ITSELF installed.
 *
 * Clash worked that out first, in painful detail (`lib/clash/visibility-
 * ownership.ts`, #2654 / #2662) — record what you installed, test ownership by
 * VALUE rather than by `Set` reference or by "was my feature active", and
 * release only on a match. IDS's per-row focus (#2867) needs exactly the same
 * predicate over its own record. This module is that predicate, once: two
 * subsystems that must agree about a shared channel cannot drift apart if
 * there is only one implementation for them to drift from.

 * Content equality for an ownership record. The shared channels are only ever

 * in place, so equal members mean the channel still shows exactly the
 * presentation that was installed.
 *
 * Ownership is tested by VALUE, not by `Set` reference: reference identity
 * would be exact, but it is destroyed by every flow that snapshots and later
 * restores the channel with equal content in a fresh `Set` — Space Sketch's
 * open/close view capture (`useSpaceSceneFraming` clones the prior sets and
 * replays them through the cloning slice setters) and a source-model resync
 * (`syncSourceModel` rebuilds the kept sets even when nothing was filtered).
 *
 * The teardown seam did NOT retire the second one, and an earlier revision of
 * this comment wrongly said it had. `visibilitySlice.teardown.ts` gates all six
 * of its keys on ONE `touched` flag, so a stale id in `hiddenEntities` alone
 * still emits a fresh, equal `isolatedEntities` (measured; #3346 tracks the
 * per-key gate). Do not simplify `sameMembers` to reference identity on the
 * strength of this paragraph: that reopens #2662 P2 on the resync path.
 * Under reference identity those flows silently converted a feature-owned
 * focus into "user" state, so the next run replaced the result set but left
 * the old presentation isolated/ghosted (#2662 P2). Value identity survives
 * any content-preserving rewrite, and its one false positive is harmless by
 * construction: it only fires when the channel shows EXACTLY what was
 * installed, in which case releasing it renders precisely what discarding that
 * presentation should render.

/**
 * The record fields a channel write has just made STALE — the one shared

 *
 * A record that outlives its presentation is not inert. Ownership is tested by
 * VALUE, so it goes matching → cleared → MATCHING AGAIN the moment any other
 * owner installs a set with equal content, and the next release then destroys
 * THAT owner's presentation (#2654 fourth review). Each subsystem already drops
 * its OWN record as it releases, and IDS's set-level isolate drops the row
 * focus's — but nothing dropped a record when a DIFFERENT owner replaced the
 * channel underneath it. Three running reproductions, one per direction:
 * clash's `focusClash` over an IDS row focus, `useClash.clearHighlight()` over
 * one, and an IDS row focus over a clash ghost.
 *
 * Fixing that per caller is one direction of a two-way rule, and the next owner
 * of the channel reintroduces it. So it is answered where the channels are
 * actually written instead — and for EVERY record symmetrically, not for the
 * one that happened to be reported. "Where they are written" is the store's own
 * `set`, wrapped once in `store/visibility-invalidation.ts`: a list of writing
 * ACTIONS was tried first and was already incomplete on the day it was written
 * (`showAllInAllModels`, and ten actions in `pinboardSlice`).
 *
 * Invalidation is by CONTENT, not by "somebody wrote": `next` is the state the
 * channels are about to hold, and a record still content-matching it survives.
 * That is what keeps the content-preserving rewrites alive — Space Sketch's
 * open/close view capture and `syncSourceModel`'s rebuild both replay an
 * unchanged channel through these setters, and under a blanket "any write
 * invalidates" rule they would silently convert a feature-owned focus into
 * "user" state, which is #2662 P2 again. It is also why this cannot strand a
 * presentation the way an unconditional null would: every installer writes the
 * CHANNEL first and its record second (`useClash.installClashIsolation` /
 * `installClashGhost`, `useIDS.installFocusIsolation` / `installFocusGhost`),
 * so a record can never be invalidated by the very write that installed it.
 * (The middleware also leaves a record the patch itself carries alone, so an
 * installer that committed both in ONE `set()` would be safe too.)
 *
 * @returns a partial state patch — `{}` when nothing went stale, so the common
 *   case adds no keys to the `set()` and slice-level harnesses that stub `get()`
 *   without these fields are unaffected.
