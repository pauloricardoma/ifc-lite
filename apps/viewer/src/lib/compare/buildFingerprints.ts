/**
 * Viewer adapter for the `@ifc-lite/diff` engine (issue #924).
 *
 * Turns a loaded model — its `IfcDataStore` plus the tessellated meshes from
 * the geometry pass — into the per-entity {@link EntityFingerprint}s the
 * store-agnostic engine matches and classifies. This is the viewer's
 * counterpart to the CLI adapter; the canonical data fingerprint comes from
 * `@ifc-lite/diff`'s {@link buildDataFingerprint} (the same hash the threejs
 * compare example pioneered) and the geometry fingerprint is the RTC-invariant
 * WASM hash riding on each `MeshData.geometryHash`.
 *
 * The `aabb` rides alongside it on `MeshData.geometryAabb`, from the same WASM
 * pass (#1891). It is ABSOLUTE world in the renderer's Y-up frame — RTC and the
 * per-element `origin` already folded in on the Rust side — which is what makes
 * it comparable across two revisions that chose different RTC offsets, the
 * frame contract `EntityFingerprint.aabb` demands. Do not add `origin` to it,
 * and do not substitute a box folded from `MeshData.positions`: those are
 * RTC- and origin-relative and would report a moved element as stationary.
 *
 * A federated model whose vertices were re-baked into the anchor's frame has
 * had its boxes re-framed with them (`hooks/ingest/federationAlignAabb.ts`),
 * so both sides of a compare are read in one frame no matter which of them
 * the federation anchored on.
 *
 * The proved enclosed volume (#1993) rides on `MeshData.geometryVolume` from
 * that same pass, and is the one fingerprint that does NOT survive that trip:
 * the alignment rescales, and no re-measurement is available on this side. It
 * is therefore withheld for a re-baked model rather than re-derived — see
 * `geometryVolumesSurviveAlignment`.
 *
 * Scope: only entities that produced at least one mesh are fingerprinted —
 * the engine needs a geometry hash to detect geometry changes, and the
 * compare UI colours meshed elements in 3D. Data-only edits on those meshed
 * entities are still detected via the data hash.
