/**
 * Viewer adapter for the `@ifc-lite/diff` engine (issue #924).
 *
 * Turns a loaded model — its `IfcDataStore` plus the tessellated meshes from
 * the geometry pass — into the per-entity {@link EntityFingerprint}s the
 * store-agnostic engine matches and classifies. This is the viewer's
 * counterpart to the CLI adapter; the canonical data fingerprint comes from
 * `@ifc-lite/diff`'s {@link buildDataFingerprint} (the same hash the threejs
 * compare example pioneered) and the geometry fingerprint is the RTC-invariant
 * WASM hash riding on each `MeshData.geometryHash`.
 *
 * The `aabb` rides alongside it on `MeshData.geometryAabb`, from the same WASM
 * pass (#1891). It is ABSOLUTE world in the renderer's Y-up frame — RTC and the
 * per-element `origin` already folded in on the Rust side — which is what makes
 * it comparable across two revisions that chose different RTC offsets, the
 * frame contract `EntityFingerprint.aabb` demands. Do not add `origin` to it,
 * and do not substitute a box folded from `MeshData.positions`: those are
 * RTC- and origin-relative and would report a moved element as stationary.
 *
 * A federated model whose vertices were re-baked into the anchor's frame has
 * had its boxes re-framed with them (`hooks/ingest/federationAlignAabb.ts`),
 * so both sides of a compare are read in one frame no matter which of them
 * the federation anchored on.
 *
 * The proved enclosed volume (#1993) rides on `MeshData.geometryVolume` from
 * that same pass, and is the one fingerprint that does NOT survive that trip:
 * the alignment rescales, and no re-measurement is available on this side. It
 * is therefore withheld for a re-baked model rather than re-derived — see
 * `geometryVolumesSurviveAlignment`.
 *
 * Scope: every entity that produced at least one mesh, PLUS every `IfcProduct`
 * with a GlobalId — see `compareScope.ts` for why that second half exists and
 * where its line is drawn. The mesh-only enumeration this widens made "did it
 * change?" quietly mean "did a renderable thing change?", so a geometry-less
 * `IfcElementAssembly` could have its attributes rewritten, and a geometry-less
 * `IfcSite` could be deleted outright, with the panel reporting neither.
 * Data-only edits on meshed entities were, and remain, detected via the data
 * hash.
 *
 * A product with no mesh carries, in place of a WASM geometry hash, a
 * fingerprint of its COMPOSED WORLD PLACEMENT (`worldPlacement.ts`). Leaving it
 * with no geometry hash at all made the whole geometry channel silent for that
 * population, and an entire re-georeferenced `IfcSite` — moved 40 m, turned 60
 * degrees, subtree and all — was reported as unchanged. It must be the composed
 * transform rather than the local placement: re-georeferencing rewrites the
 * placement *expression* of objects that did not move, and flagging those cries
 * wolf on every corrected model.
 *
 * The data fingerprint also carries the entity's RESOLVED MATERIAL NAMES,
 * through every `IfcMaterial*` indirection. Material was in no channel at all,
 * so re-specifying an element moved nothing.
