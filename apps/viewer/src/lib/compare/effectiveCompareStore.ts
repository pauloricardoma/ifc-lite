/**
 * The store Compare fingerprints for a model: the model as the user has edited
 * it, not the file as it was loaded (#5214 finding 2, #5312, charter #5249).
 *
 * Compare's data channel reads the parsed store everywhere. Entity membership
 * comes from `comparableProductIds`, and names, psets, quantities, types,
 * materials and classifications come from `buildDataInput`'s extractors. The
 * mutation overlay never writes into that store. Its geometry channel is live,
 * because `removeEntity` prunes the deleted element's mesh. So an edited model
 * compared as two halves that disagree: a deleted wall lost its mesh but was
 * still fingerprinted, a renamed or re-psetted element read its pre-edit
 * values, and an element created this session was not compared at all.
 *
 * Fixing that one extractor at a time would thread the overlay through a dozen
 * readers, each a new place to forget. Instead this bakes the overlay the way
 * `MergedExporter.exportAsync` does: export the model with its mutations
 * applied and re-parse the bytes. Every Compare read then answers for the
 * effective model by construction. The exporter keeps every source express id,
 * and a created entity keeps its overlay id, so the model's meshes (keyed by
 * id plus the model's offset) still pair with the right fingerprints.
 *
 * A model with no pending edits returns its own store unchanged, so the bake
 * costs nothing on the common path. When there are edits it is one
 * export-and-parse per compared model per run, O(model). That is the price of
 * an answer that cannot miss an overlay read.
