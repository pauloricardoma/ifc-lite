/**
 * Split the engine-wide added/modified/deleted counts into products vs type
 * objects (`IfcBuildingElementProxyType` etc.).
 *
 * `DiffCounts` — and every headline built from it (the panel's counts grid,
 * the exported report's summary, the run telemetry) — totals BOTH populations
 * together, because the engine compares them together (`compareScope.ts`:
 * type objects reach the diff through the geometry pass, products through
 * `comparableProductIds`). For a certification exercise the expected answer
 * counts products only, so a user reading the combined "30 modified" gets a
 * number that does not match the products they are grading — this exact
 * confusion has happened twice.
 *
 * Classification comes from {@link isTypeObjectClass}, i.e. from the
 * cross-schema inheritance chain — **never** from the parser's IFC4 codegen
 * pin, which answers an empty chain for IFC4X3-only classes and would
 * silently mis-bucket every one of them (`typeObjectTag.ts` names this trap;
 * it has bitten four times in this codebase).
 *
 * The question asked is "is this positively a TYPE OBJECT?", not "is this
 * positively a product?". The two differ exactly on the classes no bundled
 * schema declares — vendor extensions — plus any non-product root that
 * reaches the diff through the geometry pass. Neither chain can prove those,
 * and only a positive `IfcTypeObject` proof may subtract a row from the
 * user's PRIMARY number: demoting an unprovable class to the "+N type
 * objects" hint would silently under-report the very product changes being
 * graded.
