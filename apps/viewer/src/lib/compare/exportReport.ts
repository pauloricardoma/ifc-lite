/**
 * Export the full compare result as a flat change report (issue #1202).
 *
 * The comparison already produces every signal a coordinator needs; this turns
 * the in-memory diff into a portable list — one row per added / deleted /
 * changed element with its GlobalId, name, type and a human change label — and
 * serializes it to JSON or CSV for reporting and the Practitioner training.
 *
 * Geometry classification (moved / reshaped) reuses the same AABB-centre logic
 * as the detail panel (`summarizeGeometryChange`), but every element's bounds
 * are pre-indexed in a single pass per model so a large report stays O(meshes),
 * not O(elements × meshes).
