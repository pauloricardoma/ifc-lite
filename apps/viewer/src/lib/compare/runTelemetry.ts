 * say how often the content pass fires in the field, and how much of what it
 * finds it resolves versus hands back for review. The claim counts (#4955)
 * are the same evidence for the suggestion stages: how often a replaced-in-
 * place or a split is offered, and (via the accept / reject events) how
