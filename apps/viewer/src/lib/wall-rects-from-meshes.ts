/**
 * Wall footprint RECTANGLES for the face-based room derivation, read from the
 * RENDERED meshes — the exact geometry the user sees in the 3D scene and behind
 * the sketch as the construction underlay.
 *
 * Why not the STEP source geometry (`@ifc-lite/create` extract-walls)? Because a
 * source-geometry centreline is only ever self-consistent: it was repeatedly
 * validated against its OWN output, yet the room lines still landed off the
 * rendered walls. Measured on a real 1036-wall structural model, the source path
 * had (a) NO thickness for 0/1036 walls → every wall drawn at the 0.2 m default
 * while real walls span 0.08–1.04 m, and (b) a PCA-centroid axis bias up to
 * 0.33 m on thick walls. Deriving the rectangle straight from the rendered mesh
 * footprint eliminates both: the OBB width IS the rendered thickness, and the
 * min/max OBB axis is distribution-invariant. Room edges then sit on the rendered
 * wall faces to ~1 mm (measured), because they ARE the rendered faces.
 *
 * Frame: the rendered meshes are WebGL Y-up (`world = origin + position`). The
 * plan footprint is render XZ; we map it to the same "room frame" the underlay
 * uses (`useConstructionUnderlay`), which is the model's OWN IFC frame —
 * `ifcX = renderX + shift.x`, `ifcY = −renderZ − shift.z`.
 *
 * NOT the georeferenced world frame. `wasmRtcOffset` is the offset the WASM
 * mesh path subtracted when it resolved a site placement that anchors the
 * building to a survey grid; adding it back here yields survey coordinates,
 * and those are wrong for every consumer downstream. `addSpace` writes the
 * outline into a storey whose placement chain ALREADY carries that anchor, so
 * survey coordinates get the offset applied twice; the 3D ghost
 * (`buildElementMesh`) reads render-frame corners; and the storey band below
 * compares against render-frame mesh heights. Measured on a 6-storey LV95
 * model (rtc = 2665510 / 1259339 / 381.3 m, geometry local to ~360 m): the
 * band landed 381 m under the building so NO storey found a wall, and once it
 * did, the baked rooms were written 2.66 million metres off. rtc is null for
 * any model within 10 km of the origin, which is why neither showed up until
 * a georeferenced file arrived.
 *
 * Storey scoping is a render-Y (height) band overlap, so a full-height wall
 * correctly bounds rooms on every storey it passes through. `floorElevation`
 * is the storey's own `IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation` — local to the building,
 * the same frame the rendered geometry is in.
 *
 * The one consumer that DOES need the file's own placement-chain coordinates
 * — the Space Sketch bake, which divides the storey chain out of the outline
 * before `addSpace` (#4503) — gets the survey anchor back explicitly through
 * `roomFrameToModelWorld`, so the room frame stays local here and the bake
 * still folds through the right frame.
