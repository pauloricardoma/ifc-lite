/**
 * The grids authored this session, drawn in 3D (charter #6232, D3).
 *
 * A design grid is lines, not a body: the wasm mesher gives an IfcGrid no
 * mesh, and the symbolic overlay that draws a FILE's grid axes walks the
 * source bytes, which a grid created in the overlay is not in. So an authored
 * grid would be in the tree, on the snap and in the export, and invisible.
 * This draws its axes as thin strips on the storey, on the `grids` authoring
 * overlay channel, recomputed whenever the model is edited (place, undo, redo,
 * delete, a collab peer's edit), so what is drawn is what the model holds.
 * File grids are left to the symbolic overlay: only overlay-created ones here.
