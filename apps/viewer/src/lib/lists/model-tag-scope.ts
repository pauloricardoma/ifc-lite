/**
 * A list's MODEL TAG scope (#4215): which of the federation's models a list
 * runs over, decided by the models' user-facing tags with the same four
 * predicates search and clash use (`@ifc-lite/rules's model-tag.ts`), so "Structure"
 * means the same set of models in a quantity list as in a clash rule.
 *
 * Lists have their own data-provider integration — one provider per model
 * (`ListPanel.modelProviderPairs`) — so a `modelTag` search rule alone does
 * not scope a list; this decides which providers the run is handed.
 *
 * Unresolved references are refused, never widened: a scope naming a tag
 * that no longer exists resolves to an error the panel shows, and the list
 * is not run — running it over every model, or over none with nothing on
 * screen to say why, would both misreport what the list covers.
