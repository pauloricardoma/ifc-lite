 * A whole-model rotation about the workspace VERTICAL axis only.

 * Repositioning a model in practice means seating a building on a site: a
 * heading change plus an offset. Tilting a model out of plumb is not that job,
 * so there is deliberately no second or third axis here — `angle` is a yaw and
 * nothing else, and the panel says so.
 *
 * `angle` is radians, positive counter-clockwise seen from above. That is an
 * IFC yaw about +Z, which in the renderer's Y-up frame is the SAME angle about
 * +Y — the convention `Scene.rotateMeshesForEntity` and `rotateEntity` already
 * use for per-entity yaw, and this must not become a second one.
 *
 * `pivot` is in engineering X/Y/Z metres, in the model's UN-TRANSLATED frame as
 * stored on a placement (`rotatePlacements` converts the workspace point a user
 * enters with `pivotInModelFrame`). Its Z is carried so
 * the value round-trips through the manifest unchanged, but a vertical-axis
 * rotation cannot read it: only the horizontal pair positions the axis.
