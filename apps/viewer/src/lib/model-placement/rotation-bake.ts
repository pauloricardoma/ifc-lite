/**
 * Keeping each model's geometry in the state its placement's rotation declares.
 *
 * The placement state is the single source of truth for a heading; this is the
 * one place that makes the vertices agree with it. Committing, undoing,
 * redoing, importing and resetting all move the same declared value, so all
 * five arrive here and none needs its own geometry path.
 *
 * THREE ORDERING CONTRACTS, all load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing else may rewrite a rotated model's vertices IN PLACE without
 *     bumping the content version.** A federation re-align must call
 *     {@link ModelRotationBaker.unbake} BEFORE it snapshots or restores
 *     anything, so a rotation can never end up baked inside a `preAlignment`
 *     snapshot — a snapshot that contained one would restore *to* a rotated
 *     state and the next bake would compound it.
 *
 *  2. **A baseline is invalidated per model, by that model's own meshes, and
 *     never by the store-wide `geometryContentVersion`.** That counter is
 *     shared: a collab update to ONE model bumps it for all of them, and
 *     reading every bump as a rewrite of every model would re-capture an
 *     untouched model's already-rotated vertices as "pristine" and turn it a
 *     second time. The only in-place rewrite of existing meshes is a re-align,
 *     which (1) already brackets.
 *
 *  3. **An operation that moves a model's RENDER FRAME rather than its geometry
 *     must move the baseline with it**, by calling {@link
 *     ModelRotationBaker.rebaseFrame} before it republishes the model. The
 *     federation RTC convergence (`hooks/ingest/federationRtcRebase.ts`, #4897)
 *     is that operation: it shifts each mesh's f64 `origin` and the
 *     `CoordinateInfo` anchor and leaves `positions` untouched, so contract (1)
 *     does not catch it — the vertices never change and un-baking around it
 *     would be wrong anyway, because a yaw and a pure translation commute and
 *     the already-baked heading rides along correctly. What does NOT ride along
 *     is the pristine copy: a baseline taken in the pre-convergence frame would
 *     restore pre-convergence origins, dropping the model back out of the
 *     shared frame on the next heading edit. The stored PIVOT is frame-relative
 *     for the same reason and is rebased beside it
 *     (`modelPlacementSlice.rebasePlacementFrame`).
 *
 * Nothing here relies on the identity of the geometry OBJECT. Streaming
 * (`appendGeometryBatch`) pushes meshes onto the live array and republishes it
 * under a new object without bumping the version, so a new object can carry
 * already-baked meshes; a collab replacement carries none of them. Baselines
 * are therefore keyed by MESH identity: a replacement is the case where no mesh
 * is known, an append the case where some are, and a mesh that is not in the
 * baseline has never been baked. That is what keeps rotating from compounding
 * on geometry that streams in after the user has set an angle.
 *
 * THE COROLLARY FOR AUTHORING: a mesh appended to a rotated model must be in
 * the model's own UNROTATED frame, exactly like a streamed batch, because it
 * will be turned once on arrival. A mesh built from IFC parameters already is
 * (add-element, and the wall / slab split, which rebuild their halves through
 * `addWall` / `addSlab`). A mesh DERIVED from live vertices is not: those are
 * baked. Such a path reads its source through {@link ModelRotationBaker.inModelFrame}
 * rather than the live mesh — a copy of the live bytes would be turned twice.
 *
 * Baselines cost a copy of a model's position and normal buffers, so one is
 * captured only when a model is actually rotated and released the moment its
 * rotation returns to zero.
