/**
 * User-defined clash exclusions.
 *
 * The engine already skips pairs the IFC itself declares non-clashing (an
 * opening in its host, a filler in its opening, siblings of one
 * `IfcRelAggregates`) — see `exclusions` in `@ifc-lite/clash`. What it cannot
 * know is which *designed* interpenetrations a given project considers normal:
 * ballast embedding sleepers, stacked pavement courses, a girder cast into a
 * deck. Those are decisions about a model, so they belong to the user.
 *
 * Three granularities, because one is not enough:
 * - `typeAny`     — every clash with at least ONE side of a given IFC class.
 *                   "Pavement slabs meeting anything is by design."
 * - `typePair`    — every clash between two IFC classes, in either order. One
 *                   rule clears a whole systematic family in a single action.
 * - `elementPair` — exactly the two elements of one clash, and nothing else.
 *
 * `typeAny` exists because the intent "ignore anything touching an `IfcSlab`"
 * is ONE decision but needs one `typePair` rule per counterpart class actually
 * present — a count that grows with the federation, not with the intent. On one
 * infrastructure model that was 3 rules for `IfcSlab` alone.
 *
 * Element identity is the DURABLE element key alone (IfcGUID / USD prim
 * path) — the same encoding `clashReviewKey` (`@ifc-lite/clash`) uses for
 * review state, and for the same reason: `ClashElementRef.model` is the
 * viewer's per-load `crypto.randomUUID()` (`useIfcLoader`/`useIfcFederation`),
 * so qualifying the rule identity with it would make every element-pair rule
 * go permanently inert on the next reload while the panel still lists it as
 * enabled. TYPE rules are, likewise, deliberately cross-model: an IFC class
 * means the same thing in every file.
 * The pair kinds compare through `pairKey`, which is order-independent and
 * length-prefixed, so `A × B` and `B × A` are one rule and no separator can be
 * forged out of a name; `typeAny` gets its order-independence from testing both
 * sides of the clash against the one class it names.
 *
 * Rules are applied as a FILTER over a completed result rather than being fed
 * to the engine's `ExclusionSet`. That is deliberate: it is what lets the panel
 * say how many clashes each rule is suppressing, and lets a rule be toggled or
 * removed without re-running detection.
