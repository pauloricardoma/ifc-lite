 * Resolving a clash set filter (`./set-filter.ts`) to the elements it selects.
 *
 * It runs the SAME evaluator the search panel runs
 * (`evaluateFilterRulesFederated`): there is deliberately no second predicate
 * implementation to drift from the first, so everything here is plumbing
 * between that evaluator and `ClashRule.membersA` / `membersB`.
 *
 * Split from the definition half because this import chain reaches the parser,
 * and the clash store slice loads the definitions (through `persistence.ts`)
 * on the boot path.

 * pins that, because a rule that failed to find its filter would quietly run
 * its selector over everything instead).
 *
 * A filter that matches nothing resolves to an EMPTY member list rather than
 * to `undefined`: the engine reads the two apart (`members.ts`), and rounding
 * "matched nothing" up to "no filter" would silently run the rule over every
 * element its selector covers.
 *
 * Identical filters resolve ONCE. One filter is a full federation scan that
 * can parse property sets on demand, and reusing "external walls" as the A
 * side of five rules is the normal way a rule set is written.
