/**
 * Which model-tag memberships a clash run was COMPUTED ON (#4215).
 *
 * A clash set filter with a `modelTag` rule resolves its members from one
 * snapshot of the store (`evaluatorModelsFromState` in `useClash.runPresets`),
 * so re-tagging a model while the engine runs cannot move an element between
 * the sets halfway through. The flip side is that a finished result can be on
 * screen while the tags it was computed on have since changed — the rows are
 * still correct for the run that produced them, but no longer describe what
 * "Structure vs Architecture" would find NOW. This module lets the panel say
 * so instead of leaving the user to guess.
 *
 * Bound to the result object with a WeakMap for the reason
 * `federation-identity.ts` gives: a sibling store field can describe a result
 * that is no longer there; an entry keyed on the result cannot.
