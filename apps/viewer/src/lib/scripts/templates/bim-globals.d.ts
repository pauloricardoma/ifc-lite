 * An entity as the sandbox hands it to a script.

 * Every attribute is present under BOTH spellings and both always carry the
 * same value. **PascalCase is canonical** — it is the EXPRESS attribute name
 * for `GlobalId`, `Name`, `Description` and `ObjectType`, and it is what the
 * built-in templates use. Prefer it in new scripts. The camelCase half is
 * kept for compatibility with existing saved scripts and is not going away
 * without a major (#2422).
 *
 * `ref` and `type`/`Type` have no EXPRESS counterpart: `Type` is the entity's
 * IFC class name, not an attribute. For the IfcTypeObject behind an
 * occurrence use `bim.query.typeProperties(entity)`.

   *   the pair's f32 precision floor also reports `touch`, with `distance: 0`
   *   and `distanceKind: 'mesh'` — there the 0 is a CLASSIFICATION (the
   *   surfaces are flush to within what the f32 source coordinates can
   *   represent; nothing is measurably penetrating), not a measured gap.
   *   For a hard clash it is the exact
   *   box-box penetration depth (minimum translation distance along a
   *   separating axis, Gottschalk), certified only when BOTH elements are —
   *   within tolerance — rectangular boxes (`obb.ts`); this replaced an
   *   earlier "deepest crossing-triangle vertex" probe that was a sampling
   *   artifact, converging to 0 as a mesh was retessellated instead of to the
   *   true depth (PR #2536).
   * - `'estimate'` — an uncertified depth: the smallest overlapping dimension of
   *   the two element AABBs, or for a box through-penetration that value capped
   *   by the box-box minimum translation distance (see below). Reported for a hard clash whenever the narrow phase could not
   *   certify a box-box depth. That happens in four shapes, all common in real
   *   models: either element is not (confirmed) a box; surfaces that only
   *   coincide (stacked layers sharing a footprint); one solid modelled wholly
   *   inside another; and a member piercing clean through the other — even
   *   when BOTH are boxes, because the box-box minimum-translation-distance is
   *   then dominated by the piercing member's own extent along the shared
   *   axis, not by the material it actually crossed, and is withheld from
   *   `'mesh'` for exactly that reason. The value is then a property of the two
   *   BOXES, not of the solids — it can equal an element's own thickness rather
   *   than how far the two actually interpenetrate. Treat it as an indication of
   *   scale, not as a measurement. For a through-penetration between two boxes
   *   it never exceeds the box-box minimum translation distance, a distance
   *   proven to separate them (#5742).
