// file / pset / property names out of git applies to analytics too: NO event
// may carry a file name, model name, BCF title, free text, or a filesystem
// path — even accidentally from a future call site. `scrubEvent` runs on every
// captured event (including PostHog's own $pageleave / $exception) as a safety
// net on top of the deliberately lean explicit properties.

// Keys whose values tend to be PII / free text / confidential identifiers.
// Matches whole `_`-delimited words, so analytics keys like `data_source`,
// `auto_color_source`, `template_id` or `field` are deliberately left intact.

// ── Noise filter ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every matcher here decides whether to DELETE an event — irreversibly and
// silently, since nothing anywhere records that the event existed. A
// misclassification can at least be re-derived from the stored event; a drop
// cannot be re-derived from anything.
//
// INVARIANT, a property of the whole boolean and not of any one clause: every
// arm matches the exception value AS A WHOLE — anchored at BOTH ends, or
// structural (parse the payload and require the field to BE the token) — so an
// unrelated actionable error that merely QUOTES one of these strings still
// reaches us. #1914 named that hazard while anchoring one arm; three siblings
// were found loose afterwards, each by checking the neighbours of an arm
// somebody had already fixed. A one-end anchor is NOT enough and reads exactly
// like a fix: `^`-only still eats our trailing sentence, `$`-only still eats
// our leading one.
//
// There are TWO axes and an arm has to be tight on both. EXTENT: how much of
// the value the match covers, which is what anchoring buys. IDENTITY: whether
// what matched actually IS the third-party failure. An arm can be exact about
// the shape it matched and vague about whose shape that is — "contains these
// three key names" dropped anything HTTP-ish until `isCesiumRequestError`
// below required Cesium's own-property set exactly. Same defect family,
// different axis, found one review apart.
//
// Adding an arm means constraining both ends AND listing its wording in
// `DROPPED_NOISE_SAMPLES` (./analytics.test.ts), which re-runs every sample
// under four carriers — text before, text after, both sides, and a comma-led
// trailing sentence for the arms that SPLIT the value — and fails unless each
// survives with its own kind, level and fingerprint.
//
// Know what that does and does not buy you. Every wording IN the list is
// protected: loosening any registered arm turns the harness red, including
// arms nobody wrote a dedicated test for. An arm you add and DON'T register is
// invisible to it — a fresh `value.includes(…)` clause with no list entry
// passes everything. Registration is a convention this comment asks for, not a
// gate. Skipping it is how the next instance of this defect gets in.
//
// Cesium rejects failed tile / terrain / imagery / ion-asset requests with a
// `RequestErrorEvent` — a plain `{ statusCode, response, responseHeaders }`
// object, not an Error. During continuous globe rendering these fire from deep
// inside Cesium's request scheduler (a tile 403/404/429/timeout), so the geo
// call sites we own (all `try/catch`-wrapped) can't intercept them, and they
// surface as unhandled rejections that PostHog's exception autocapture records.
// They are unactionable third-party network failures, not ifc-lite bugs, so we
// drop the `$exception` event entirely. Match on Cesium's stable property-name
// shape (those three keys), NOT the minified class name (`D_`), which changes
// every build. posthog-js stringifies a non-Error throwable as
// "'<ctor>' captured as exception with keys: <comma-separated own keys>", and
// that IS the whole value — even for an unhandled rejection, whose non-Error
// reason posthog re-coerces through this same path rather than prefixing it.
//
// STRUCTURAL, over the complete value: the ctor token (quoted or bare depending
// on which coercion ran, never spaced), then a key list whose members are
// EXACTLY Cesium's three own properties. Anchoring at `^` alone was not enough and is
// the same half-measure this file exists to remove: the lookaheads scanned the
// rest of the value, so "RequestErrorEvent captured as exception with keys:
// statusCode, response, responseHeaders and our uploader then wrote 0 bytes"
// was dropped with our own trailing sentence inside it. Validating the list
// instead of searching it also leaves posthog free to reorder or respace the
// keys (it sorts and `", "`-joins them today), which a fully literal `^…$`
// would not.
//
// The ctor token is matched but NOT required to read `RequestErrorEvent`, and
// that is not an oversight: in production Cesium's class name is minified —
// the recorded occurrence behind #1175 is literally `'D_'`, which is why that
// issue keyed on the property shape in the first place. Requiring the readable
// name makes this arm dead everywhere it matters (verified: it fails #1175's
// own regression test). The identity constraint that DOES survive minification
// is the exact own-property set, which is what the length check below enforces.

// inside a DOM event listener, where no try/catch of ours is on the stack.
//
// The condition is a property of the user's GPU (missing OES_packed_depth_

// stable message + the `webglcontextcreationerror` token, never on a minified
// name — the same discipline as the Cesium matcher above. Deliberately narrow:
// a WebGL failure that is ever actionable must not be silently dropped.
//
// Both shapes come from `isMapWebglInitFailureMessage`, imported rather than
// restated so MapLibre's wordings keep ONE home. #1914 anchored the bare

//
// The set stays exactly MapLibre's two throw shapes and is NOT widened to v6's
// `WebGL2 is required to display this map`: #2354 keeps that family (classified
// `webgl_unavailable`, one fingerprint, downgraded to `warning`) precisely so

// meshes: 120070." — so every distinct mesh count minted its OWN issue: one
// real bug arrived as eleven separate issues (and eleven GitHub issues) in a
// single retention window, which is exactly the "same problem, one fix" case
// PostHog documents custom fingerprints for.
//
// A constant message is not enough on its own, which is what #2354 showed: the
// minimap's WebGL report is one fixed string per reason, yet it minted a fresh
// issue on each deploy, because the stack that feeds the default hash names the
// hashed bundle it came from (`main-DnUx64at.js`, then `index-B0OhdiDw.js`, …).
// Four issues, one benign condition. A fingerprint is the only thing that
// survives a release.
//
// Scoped deliberately to the families `classifyLoadError` recognises. An
// unrecognised exception keeps PostHog's default per-message grouping, so we

// ── Benign-vs-real severity ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// posthog-js stamps every captured exception `$exception_level: 'error'`, which
// says "the app is broken". Two of our recognised families are not: a dropped
// connection and a cancellation are user-side and transient — issue #1903 was
// one user's cold-cache first visit whose engine download blipped, and whose
// session went on to load a model successfully 22 s later.
//
// They are DOWNGRADED, not dropped, so they stay queryable (a spike in
// `network_unavailable` is a real signal about a CDN or a region) while no
// longer competing with genuine breakage on an error-level issue list. Only a
// level of `error` is rewritten, so a capture site that deliberately chose
// `fatal` / `warning` / `info` is never clobbered. `wasm_engine_load` is
// pointedly NOT in this set: a rotated or 404ing engine binary means the deploy
// is broken for everyone and must stay loud.
//
// `webgl_unavailable` joins them for the same reason, on stronger evidence
// (#2354). It is not a failure at all in the sense `error` claims: the minimap
// probes for a WebGL context, the device refuses one, and `LocationMap` paints
// its fallback with the coordinate readout, place search, the external map
// links and KMZ export all still working. Nothing the user or a code change can
// alter — the reported occurrences are a device whose GPU is missing an
// extension or whose GPU process could not serve a second context. It stays
// captured and queryable (with `map_unavailable_reason` and `webgl_status`
// intact), just not competing with real breakage on an error-level list.
//
// three.js's `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Error creating WebGL context.` was pointedly
// NOT in this bucket while nothing caught it: it threw out of an `/mcp` mount
// effect and took the React tree down, which is breakage and had to stay
// error-level. #2401 removed that premise — both `/mcp` scenes now mount behind
// `useThreeScene`, degrade to a static panel, and report once as a HANDLED
// exception — so #2458 folds those wordings into `webgl_unavailable` (see
// `isThreeContextRefusal` in ./webgl-unavailable.ts) and they inherit this severity
// with it. If a WebGLRenderer is ever constructed outside that guard again, the
// throw would arrive here benign; the guard is the thing keeping this honest.

// The browser told us it was offline when the fetch failed, so the failure is

// ALL THREE signals: `online === false` alone could accompany an unrelated bug,
// and `network_unavailable` alone may well be ours (a dead CDN edge reads the
// same to an online client). Capture sites set `online` from `navigator.onLine`.
//
// The third is the frameless gate, and it closes a case that was live rather
// than hypothetical (#2410). `network_unavailable`'s doc comment in
// ./load-errors.ts rests on these strings originating INSIDE `fetch()` and so
// arriving with an EMPTY stack — but nothing enforced that, and the reproduction
// confirmed the drop fired just as readily on an exception carrying our own
// frames. A stack of ours is positive evidence that the throw happened in our
// code, whatever `navigator.onLine` said at the time, and deleting that is
// irreversible. Same `frameCount === 0` shape the two noise-filter arms above
// use, for the same reason.
