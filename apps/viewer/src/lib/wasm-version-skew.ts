/**
 * Recover from "deployment skew": a tab that has been open across a production
 * deploy holds JS referencing a content-hashed `ifc-lite_bg-<hash>.wasm` that
 * the new deploy rotated away. The lazy fetch 404s (served as `text/plain`), so
 * `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming` throws
 * `unsupported MIME type 'text/plain' … expected 'application/wasm'` and the
 * engine never initializes (issue #1363).
 *
 * The asset is gone for good, so a same-URL retry can't help — the only fix is
 * to reload the document so the browser pulls the current deployment's HTML and
 * its fresh asset URLs. The `@ifc-lite/geometry` engine broadcasts
 * {@link WASM_ASSET_UNAVAILABLE_EVENT} when it hits this; we also watch the
 * global error channels as a backstop for any wasm asset (parser, direct
 * imports) that bubbles unhandled.
 *
 * The reload is debounced per tab so a genuinely broken deploy (where the new
 * assets are also unreachable) can't spin in a reload loop.

// gone; a genuine block keeps firing because the reload never fixes it. So we
// suppress only the first few skew exceptions within a short window and let the
// rest surface. The count decays, so a genuinely-new skew later in a long
