/**
 * "How many physical objects is the viewer withholding?" — the count, and the
 * denominator it has to be derived against.
 *
 * The UI reports HIDDEN, not a ratio, because that is the number a user acts
 * on. But the hidden count still has to be derived from a total, and the
 * obvious total, `geometryResult.meshes.length`, counts things that PRODUCED a
 * mesh. An object in the file that never generated geometry is then absent
 * from the total as well, so hidden comes out as zero while a wall silently
 * failed to slice. Counting from the entity index instead makes the gap
 * between "in the model" and "on screen" observable.
 *
 * The mesh array is the wrong denominator in three separate ways, not one:
 * an element can produce MANY `MeshData` entries (one per material or CSG
 * part); a colour-merged batch carries many entities in one entry via
 * `entityIds`; and a fully-instanced entity produces NO entry at all
 * (`GeometryResult.instancedGeometryHashes`). So `meshes.length` is neither an
 * upper nor a lower bound on objects — it is a different quantity.
 *
 * ## What counts as a physical object
 *
 * An entity whose inheritance chain contains `IfcElement`, minus
 * `IfcFeatureElement` and `IfcVirtualElement` subtypes.
 *
 * `IfcElement` is the schema's own word for "an element of a construction
 * work" — a thing with physical presence. Everything excluded is excluded
 * because counting it would cry wolf, i.e. report objects as hidden that
 * were never meant to be drawn:
 *
 * - Spatial containers (`IfcSite`, `IfcBuilding`, `IfcBuildingStorey`,
 *   `IfcSpace`) descend from `IfcSpatialElement`, NOT `IfcElement`, so they
 *   fall out with no special case. They have no shape representation by
 *   design.
 * - `IfcSpace` in particular is a real object a user cares about, but the
 *   viewer ships with spaces hidden (`TYPE_VISIBILITY_SEMANTIC_DEFAULTS.spaces
 *   === false`). In the denominator, every default-loaded model with rooms
 *   would permanently report N hidden — an alarm that is never actionable
 *   and never wrong to ignore, which is the worst kind. It is a spatial
 *   element by schema and hidden by product decision, so both readings agree:
 *   out.
 * - `IfcFeatureElement` subtypes (`IfcOpeningElement`, `IfcVoidingFeature`, …)
 *   are voids subtracted from other elements, not objects. They are `IfcElement`
 *   subtypes by schema, and hidden by default (`openings === false`).
 * - `IfcVirtualElement` is a non-physical clearance/boundary volume, hidden by
 *   default for exactly that reason (issue #1133).
 * - `IfcAnnotation` and `IfcGrid` descend from `IfcProduct` but not
 *   `IfcElement`, so they fall out too — drafting aids, not objects.
 *
 * The rule deliberately keys on the schema inheritance chain rather than a
 * hardcoded leaf list, so a schema bump that adds a new `IfcElement` subtype
 * is counted without anyone remembering to edit a set here. The chain must be
 * the ACROSS-SCHEMAS one: the single-schema walk is pinned to IFC4 and returns
 * an empty chain for IFC4X3 infrastructure classes, which would silently read
 * as "not physical" (same trap documented on `isProductClass` in
 * `lib/compare/compareScope.ts`, the sibling `IfcProduct`-level predicate).
