/**
 * Pure geometry-reconstruction helpers for `drawing-markup-read.ts`, split
 * out to stay under the ~400-line house limit.
 *
 * Both `symbolic-parse.ts`'s polyline tessellation (`polylineToSegments`)
 * and the Rust fill-ring extractor (`rust/processing/src/symbolic/fill.rs`
 * `extract_curve_ring`) carry a closed `IfcPolyline`'s explicit closing
 * point straight through — the writer (`drawing-markup-geometry.ts`'s
 * `emitMarkupPolyline`) always appends a literal duplicate of the first
 * point when asked to close a ring, and neither reader dedupes it. So a
 * polygon-area's 3 authored vertices come back as 4 tessellated segments
 * (the 4th degenerate, zero-length) and a cloud's 4 rectangle corners come
 * back as a 5-point fill ring. These helpers undo that duplication once,
 * here, rather than in each per-kind reader.
