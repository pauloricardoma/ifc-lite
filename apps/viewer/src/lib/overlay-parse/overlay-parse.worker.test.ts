/**
 * The worker's contract with its client is: ALWAYS post exactly one reply,
 * and never reject.
 *
 * Silence is the one outcome the client cannot recover from cheaply — it has
 * to sit on the full 120s deadline before giving up. Before #2183's follow-up
 * the `GeometryProcessor` was constructed OUTSIDE the try, so a construction
 * failure escaped into the queue's `.catch()` and posted nothing at all.
 *
 * Under Node there is no WASM runtime, so the processor fails to come up on
 * its own. That is not a contrived stub — it is exactly the class of early
 * failure (asset unavailable, instantiate rejected) this contract exists for,
 * and it reaches the same path.
