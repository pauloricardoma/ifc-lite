/**
 * Worker host for the always-on overlay parses that need the WHOLE IFC
 * source (issue #2183).
 *
 * `parseGridLines` / `parseAlignmentLines` take the entire file, decode it
 * to a JS string, and hand that string to WASM. Two costs of that are
 * permanent in whichever realm runs it:
 *
 *   1. `safeUtf8Decode`'s scratch buffer, when the runtime rejects
 *      SAB-backed views (every cross-origin-isolated browser). Capped
 *      since #2183, but still a full-size transient.
 *   2. `WebAssembly.Memory`, which only ever grows. `dispose()` frees the
 *      wasm-bindgen handle, not the pages.
 *
 * Run on the main thread that is ~950 MB pinned for a 342 MB model, for
 * the lifetime of the tab, to draw some overlay lines. Both costs are
 * realm-local, so hosting the parse in a worker that is terminated
 * afterwards returns all of it to the OS.
 *
 * The source is a `SharedArrayBuffer`-backed view, so handing it over is
 * zero-copy: it is shared, never cloned or transferred.
