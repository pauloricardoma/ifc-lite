 *      empty reply from the same worker would then throw `DataCloneError` and
 *      be surfaced as a parse failure.
 *   2. A zero-length buffer is never put in the transfer list. There is

 * produces several genuinely empty arrays every time, so without it the FIRST
 * reply would detach them and a second job in the same worker would throw
 * `DataCloneError`.
 *
 * Buffers are de-duplicated by identity because a correct flatten may share
