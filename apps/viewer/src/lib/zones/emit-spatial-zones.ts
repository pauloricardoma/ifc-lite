/**
 * Turning a zone set into `IfcSpatialZone` entities (issue #2508 item 3).
 *
 * The emission itself is `@ifc-lite/create`'s `addSpatialZonesToStore`, which
 * knows the schema and nothing about the viewer. This module owns the one thing
 * only the viewer can answer: WHICH FRAME the numbers are in.
 *
 * ## The frame chain, which is the part that goes wrong quietly
 *
 * A zone is authored against the rendered scene, so its coordinates are in the
 * render frame: Y-up, RTC-subtracted, unit-scaled to metres. An
 * `IfcSpatialZone` has to land in the file's own frame: Z-up, un-shifted, in
 * the file's declared length unit. Three separate conversions, and getting any
 * one wrong produces a zone that is plausible and in the wrong place:
 *
 * 1. **Un-shift** with {@link renderToWorldViewer}, which adds back both the
 *    wasm RTC offset and the coordinate handler's origin shift. Reusing
 *    #2199's helper rather than re-deriving it: the two offsets are recorded in
 *    DIFFERENT axes, and adding them in the same axes folds a model's north
 *    offset into its height.
 * 2. **Swap axes** with {@link viewerToIfcAxes} (Y-up to Z-up).
 * 3. **Scale to native units**, which the builder does from the anchor rather
 *    than this module, so there is one place that knows the file's unit.
 *
 * ## Why a re-based model is refused
 *
 * Federation alignment can re-base a model into the anchor file's frame
 * (`'same-crs'` / `'reprojected'`). Undoing the render shift then yields
 * coordinates in the ANCHOR's coordinate system, not in this model's own, so
 * writing them into this model's file would place the zone by someone else's
 * origin. That is the same condition the apportionment refuses as
 * `'rescaled-by-alignment'`, refused here for the same reason.
