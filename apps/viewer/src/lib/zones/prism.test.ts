/**
 * Prism zones (#2508 item 4).
 *
 * The strongest test here is not a hand-computed number, it is the ORACLE: a
 * rectangular footprint is a box, so the prism integrator and the box
 * integrator must agree to the last bits on every fixture. They share no code
 * (different decomposition, different clip, different weights), so agreement is
 * evidence rather than tautology. The hand-computed cases then pin the cases a
 * box cannot express at all.
