/**
 * The type-inheritance half of "which volumes may a zone breakdown be taken
 * on" (#2508 / #1745 / #1755).
 *
 * Two failure modes are pinned, and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *  - dropping the type's sets entirely, which shows a mesh basis alone for
 *    every catalogue-driven element whose `NetVolume` lives on its type;
 *  - letting the type's sets WIN, which silently replaces an occurrence's own
 *    declared volume with the catalogue's nominal one.
 *
 * Order is what separates those, so order is what the tests assert.
