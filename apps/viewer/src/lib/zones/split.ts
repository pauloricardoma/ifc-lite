/**
 * Turning one element into one mesh per zone (issue #2508 item 2), around the
 * Rust `splitMeshByZones` binding.
 *
 * #2515 answers "how much of this wall is in Takt A" with a number and produces
 * no geometry. This produces the geometry, so a per-section model can be
 * exported rather than described. It is a separate, explicit action for the
 * reason the apportionment is: clipping is memory-bandwidth bound, so the only
 * lever is doing less of it.
 *
 * The binding is INJECTED rather than imported here, exactly as
 * `meshOutlineProvider` does for `meshOutline2d`: the wasm runtime is
 * gitignored and absent in the node test runner, and a module that reached for
 * it at import time could not be tested at all. Everything in this file except
 * the one call is therefore ordinary arithmetic with a test around it.
 *
 * ## The frame, which is the part that goes wrong quietly
 *
 * The renderer stores each element's positions RELATIVE to a per-mesh origin
 * (`MeshData.origin`), so building-scale coordinates stay f32-precise. Zones are
 * authored in absolute world coordinates. So the split folds the origin in on
 * the way down (f64, absolute) and takes it back out on the way up, which keeps
 * the output exactly as f32-precise as the input was. Skipping the unfold would
 * hand the GPU absolute metre coordinates in f32 and collapse a 5 km-away model
 * onto a visible grid.
