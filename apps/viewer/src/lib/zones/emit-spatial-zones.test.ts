/**
 * The FRAME half of `IfcSpatialZone` emission (#2508 item 3).
 *
 * The schema half is tested in `@ifc-lite/create`. What only the viewer can get
 * wrong is which frame the numbers are in, and that failure is invisible in a
 * shape check: a zone placed by the wrong origin is a valid IfcSpatialZone that
 * sits somewhere else. So every assertion here is about WHERE the zone lands.
