/**
 * The per-element x per-zone table (issue #2508 item 3), which is the direct
 * answer to the complaint that opened #1763:
 *
 * > you can't get clean quantities per zone without a lot of manual work in
 * > Excel or similar.
 *
 * So the deliverable is a file that opens in Excel and pivots, not a panel.
 *
 * ## Long, not wide
 *
 * ONE ROW PER (element, zone) pair rather than one row per element with a
 * column per zone. A wide table's columns change every time a zone is added,
 * renamed or deleted, so every saved pivot, formula and Power Query step
 * against it breaks; and a straddler - the population this feature exists for -
 * is exactly the row that would need several columns filled. Long format
 * pivots to wide in one step in any spreadsheet, and the reverse is a manual
 * unpivot.
 *
 * An element that reaches no zone of the set is not in the table at all. An
 * element the volumes could not be established for IS, with an empty volume and
 * the reason stated, because "this wall is in Takt B and we could not measure
 * it" is a different fact from "this wall is not in Takt B", and a total that
 * silently omits the first is the kind of number #2508's verification bar
 * exists to stop.
 *
 * Pure: the numbers arrive already resolved (`hooks/zoneFacts.ts`), which is
 * the same call the pset write-back makes. Nothing here recomputes a volume.
