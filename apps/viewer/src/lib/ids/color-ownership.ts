/**
 * Who owns the colour-override channel while a validation report (IDS or
 * Information validation) is painted red/green — and the one way to hand it
 * back (#6373).
 *
 * The report colours are an OVERLAY in `pendingColorUpdates`, the same channel
 * the lens, clash and SDK `colorize()` write; the model's own colours are never
 * touched. "Restore original colours" is therefore "stop painting": hand the
 * channel back to its base, which is the active lens's colouring
 * (`lensAppliedColors`) or, with no lens, an empty map (the renderer's "clear
 * every override" signal). That is the same restore `showAllFromStore` and the
 * clash teardowns use.
 *
 * Before #6373 the validation results had no such control — the only colour
 * button re-sent the report colours ("Reapply Colors") — and clearing or
 * replacing a report left its red/green painted on a model whose results were
 * gone.
 *
 * ## Why a revision, not a map comparison
 *
 * `pendingColorUpdates` is a one-shot SIGNAL the renderer nulls after flushing
 * it, so the painted map cannot be read back. `colorPresentationRevision`
 * (dataSlice) is the durable record: every write to the channel bumps it. IDS
 * records the revision its own last write produced; while the live revision
 * still equals it, nobody has painted since, and the report colours are what
 * is on screen. Once anyone else writes (a lens, a clash focus, a script, the
 * ribbon's Reset Colors), the claim lapses and a report clear leaves their
 * colours alone — the same test `lib/clash/group-focus.ts` uses.
