/**
 * The IDS property overlay, split into a main-thread half and a
 * realm-neutral half (#3946).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `MutablePropertyView` is a live main-thread object: it holds closures
 * (the on-demand property/attribute extractors), a base `PropertyTable`
 * and the whole mutation history, none of which survives structured
 * clone. That is the entire reason the IDS worker could not see pending
 * property edits, and the reason `useIDS` used to answer "there are
 * edits" by dropping the WHOLE validation run onto the main thread —
 * unbounded by model size, and identical in cost for one edit or a
 * thousand (#3946).
 *
 * What the bridge actually consumes is far smaller: a
 * `PropertyOverlayResolver`, i.e. `expressId -> PropertyOverride[]`, where
 * a `PropertyOverride` is plain scalar data. That IS clonable. So the
 * overlay crosses to the worker as a snapshot of that projection —
 * O(pending edits), not O(model size).
 *
 * ## The equivalence this file is shaped to guarantee
 *
 * Both realms must apply the SAME overrides, or the worker would answer a
 * different question from the main thread and the fallback would stop
 * being a fallback. Rather than assert that in a comment, there is
 * exactly ONE projection function here — {@link overridesForEntity} —
 * and both realms reach the bridge through it:
 *
 *   main thread:  overlayResolverFromSnapshot(snapshotPropertyOverlay(view))
 *   worker:       overlayResolverFromSnapshot(snapshot posted to it)
 *
 * `snapshotPropertyOverlay` is nothing but `overridesForEntity` evaluated
 * eagerly over every entity the overlay could possibly answer for, so the
 * snapshot resolver and a lazy resolver over the same view are equal on
 * every express id by construction, not by inspection.
 *
 * ## What the overlay does NOT carry, and why that is not a regression
 *
 * `MutablePropertyView.hasPendingChanges()` is true for eleven kinds of
 * overlay state (quantity edits, attribute edits, positional attribute
 * edits, retypes, pset/qset creates and deletes, overlay-created entities,
 * tombstones, as well as property edits). `PropertyOverlaySnapshot` carries
 * only the scalar property overrides. `EntityVisibilitySnapshot` (below)
 * carries the entity-membership half: tombstones, overlay-created entities
 * (class and authored attributes) and retypes. The worker re-parses
 * `source`, so without it a deleted entity is still validated and a created
 * one is never seen (#5184). Quantity edits and attribute edits remain
 * unreflected, because the bridge's `createDataAccessor(store, overlay,
 * visibility)` has no parameter that would consult them.
 *
 * The bridge consults `propertyOverlay` in `getPropertyValue` and
 * `getPropertySets`. It consults `entityVisibility` for enumeration
 * (`getAllEntityIds`, `getEntitiesByType`), for the effective class
 * (`getEntityType`) and for a created entity's attributes. Every other read
 * (classifications, materials, partOf, predefined types) goes straight to
 * the `IfcDataStore`, which the mutation overlay never writes into.

/**
 * The pending property overrides for ONE entity, or `undefined` when it
 * has none. The single projection both realms use (see the module doc).
 *
 * `mutations` is this entity's slice of `mutationHistory`, and is used ONLY
 * to enumerate WHICH (psetName, propName) pairs it has ever touched — history is
 * append-only (undo re-applies the inverse mutation with `skipHistory=true`
 * "to avoid polluting mutation history", `mutationSlice.ts`, so it never
 * pops), but the identity of a touched key never becomes wrong, only stale.
 * The actual current state/value for each key comes from
 * `MutablePropertyView.getPropertyMutation()` — the live overlay map
 * (`propertyMutations`), same source `hasChanges()` / `getModifiedEntityCount()`
 * read instead of history, for the same reason. Reading `mutation.newValue`
 * straight from history here was the bug (#3929): after an undo, the live
 * overlay had reverted but this projection still reported the pre-undo
 * (corrected) value as an active override, so IDS re-validation kept
 * reporting PASS on data that had actually reverted to failing.
 *
 * Only property mutations with a scalar value are projected — list/array
 * property values aren't part of this overlay's contract and are skipped
 * rather than mis-rendered.
