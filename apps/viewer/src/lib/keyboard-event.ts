/**
 * Defensive readers for the two `KeyboardEvent` fields whose TypeScript types
 * are stricter than what browsers actually dispatch.
 *
 * `KeyboardEvent.key` is typed `string` by the DOM lib, but it is genuinely
 * absent on some real events:
 *  - Chromium fires a `keyup` carrying no `key` when the user accepts a browser
 *    autofill / password-manager suggestion (reproduced on Edge 150 / Windows).
 *  - Events synthesised by extensions or by `dispatchEvent(new Event('keyup'))`
 *    have no `key` either — `Event` has no `key`, and nothing stops that event
 *    from reaching a `keyup` listener.
 *
 * Reading `.toLowerCase()` on that threw an uncaught
 * `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')`,
 * which aborted the rest of the handler. In the fly-through controls that left
 * the movement loop armed on a key whose `keyup` never cleared it, so panning
 * kept running until the next matching keypress.
 *
 * `event.target` is likewise `null` for an event dispatched at no node, and is
 * not necessarily an `HTMLElement` (an `SVGElement`, `document` or `window`
 * has no `tagName`/`isContentEditable`), so the "is the user typing?" guard
 * every key handler opens with needs the same treatment.
 */

/**
 * The event's `key`, lower-cased — or `null` when the browser omitted it.
 *
 * Callers should treat `null` as "no identifiable key" and skip the event:
 * every comparison against a concrete key would be false anyway.
