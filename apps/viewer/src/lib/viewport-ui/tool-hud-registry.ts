/**
 * `TOOL_HUD` registry (#5485, #5503; charter #5478 item 3).
 *
 * `ToolOverlays.tsx` reads this table instead of an `if (activeTool === …)`
 * chain: a tool declares its bar, its scene layer and its hint, and the HUD
 * places them — the bar in the top-center region, the hint in the
 * bottom-center region, both through `HudItem`, so a tool has no way to
 * invent its own `absolute` position the way `SunSkyPanel` (`top-32
 * right-4`) and `PointCloudPanel` (`bottom-4 left-4`) still do today.
 *
 * `ToolId` is the closed set of `activeTool` string literals in use across
 * the viewer (`store/slices/uiSlice.ts`'s `activeTool` is typed as a plain
 * `string`, so this is the one place that set is written down;
 * `isToolId` is the guard `ToolOverlays` uses to enter the table). Every
 * id gets a row, even an empty `{}` one, rather than making the table
 * `Partial`: a tool that has NOT declared a bar/scene/hint is still a
 * decision ("nothing here yet"), not an absence the table can't represent.
