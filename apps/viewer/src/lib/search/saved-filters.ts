/**
 * Saved filter presets — localStorage-backed catalog of named
 * `FilterRule[]` snapshots. Mirrors the `filter_presets` table from
 * the Tauri-side `filter.rs` engine: each preset stores a name, the
 * rule list, and the AND/OR combinator. Presets are surfaced in the
 * builder toolbar as a dropdown; clicking one replaces the current
 * filter state.
 *
 * Pure module — safe to import from tests (stubs storage when
 * `window.localStorage` is unavailable). Names are trimmed and
 * deduplicated by case-insensitive match, so re-saving a preset under
 * the same name overwrites it (matching the Rust ON CONFLICT behaviour).
