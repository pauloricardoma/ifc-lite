/**
 * Shared entity World-Coordinate math (IFC Z-up, project space — NOT
 * map/WGS84), backing the Lists "World X/Y/Z" columns (issue #3671).
 *
 * NOT yet the single source of truth: `PropertiesPanel.tsx` still holds its own
 * copy of the same bounding-box loop, and the two do not even agree numerically
 * — the panel renders metres while this reports project units, so a millimetre
 * model shows World Z `3.5` in the panel and `3500` in the list. The list column
 * is unit-labelled and the panel readout is not. Folding the panel onto this
 * module is the point of having it here and has not been done.
 *
 * What this computes is the CENTRE of an entity's world bounding box, not its
 * composed `IfcLocalPlacement` origin. `MeshData.localToWorld` carries the
 * resolved placement chain and is not used. For an L-shaped slab the centre can
 * sit outside the element, and it is not the number other IFC tools report as
 * the object placement.
 *
 * The frame reconstruction itself (RTC offset + origin shift, axis
 * conversion) already has one shared implementation —
 * `resolveRenderFrame`/`useRenderFrameOffsets` and `renderToWorldViewer`/
 * `viewerToIfcAxes` in `coordinate-frame.ts`, which the Properties
 * panel and the Measure tool's picked-point readout both route through. This
 * module does not re-derive that: it only adds the piece those don't cover —
 * finding an ENTITY's local-frame bounding-box center from its meshes — then
 * hands the result through the existing frame functions.
