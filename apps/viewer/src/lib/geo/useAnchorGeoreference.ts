/**
 * Resolve the federation *anchor* model's effective georeference — the model
 * whose projected CRS + IfcMapConversion define the world frame every other
 * model's vertices were baked into.
 *
 * The selection order (user-pinned anchor, else earliest-loaded model with a
 * usable map-conversion georef, else the legacy single-model store fields)
 * matches `findReferenceGeorefModel` in useIfcFederation, the Cesium georef
 * memo in ViewportContainer, and the basepoint overlay's anchor input, so the
 * measure-tool XYZ readout places points in exactly the frame the geometry was
 * placed in.
 *
 * Unlike the Cesium/solar georef memo, this hook is NOT gated on
 * `cesiumEnabled` / `solarEnabled`: the measure readout must work with Cesium
 * and the solar study both off. It also exposes the anchor's IFC-origin viewer
 * position synchronously (`-totalYupOffset`, valid because the anchor is always
 * its own frame), so callers never await a proj4 hop.
