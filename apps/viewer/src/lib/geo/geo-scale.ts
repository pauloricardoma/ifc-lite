/**
 * Compute the effective horizontal scale to apply to viewer-space coordinates
 * (which are already in metres) when transforming through IfcMapConversion.
 *
 * Per the IFC schema, IfcMapConversion.Scale converts LOCAL ENGINEERING
 * coordinates (in the project's length unit) to MAP coordinates (in the map
 * CRS unit). For a typical file with mm project units and m map units, the
 * Scale attribute is 0.001.
 *
 * The IFC formula is:
 *   E_map_units = Eastings + (X_local * absc - Y_local * ordi) * Scale
 *
 * To produce metres for proj4, we multiply by mapUnitScale; and X_local can be
 * recovered from the metre-converted geometry as X_metres / lengthUnitScale.
 * Substituting:
 *   E_metres = mapUnitScale * Eastings
 *            + (mapUnitScale * Scale / lengthUnitScale)
 *              * (X_metres * absc - Y_metres * ordi)
 *
 * So when geometry has already been converted to metres (as ifc-lite does),
 * the effective horizontal scale is (Scale * mapUnitScale) / lengthUnitScale.
 * For files where Scale is set per IFC spec to bridge the unit difference
 * (Scale = lengthUnitScale / mapUnitScale), this evaluates to 1.0 and the
 * geometry passes through unchanged. Applying the raw Scale would otherwise
 * double-scale and shrink/expand the model — see issue #595.

/**
 * Effective per-axis scales for metre viewer geometry (Scale, or Scale x
 * FactorX/Y/Z for IfcMapConversionScaled). The single home of the #595 rule.
 *
 * Spec: Scale converts LOCAL ENGINEERING coords (project length unit) to MAP
 * coords (MapUnit). Geometry is already metres, so the effective coefficient
 * is (Scale * mapUnitScale) / lengthUnitScale; a file with mm project units
 * and m map units MUST set Scale=0.001, and the coefficient evaluates to 1.
 *
 * Reality: Bonsai/IfcOpenShell, Revit's IFC exporter, and many CAD tools
 * either leave Scale unset (default 1.0) or hard-code Scale=1 regardless of
 * unit pairing. The author's intent is "geometry and offsets share the same
 * metric unit", but the spec-strict formula then multiplies viewer metres by
 * 1/lengthUnitScale (1000x for mm projects), far enough that proj4
 * extrapolates to the antipode (Hans's `IXAS_KW 018_georeffed.ifc`:
 * 126500/480000 RD offsets + mm units + Scale unset → South Pacific instead of
 * the Netherlands). Files that genuinely use Scale ≠ 1 followed the spec.
 *
 * So the heuristic is decided ONCE for the conversion, then each axis keeps
 * its own factor. It fires when Scale is absent or 1 (NaN included), the
 * project and map units differ, and no authored factor already bridges them:
 * - Scale 1 with factors (1, 1, 1) in a mm project places like the plain
 *   IFCMAPCONVERSION, at 1;
 * - Scale absent with grid factors (0.9996, 0.9996, 1) keeps them, on every axis;
 * - Scale 1 or absent with factors 0.3048 in a feet project bridges the units
 *   and places at 1;
 * - an explicit non-unit Scale (0.001 in a mm project) is spec-strict, and a
 *   factor scales on top of it.
