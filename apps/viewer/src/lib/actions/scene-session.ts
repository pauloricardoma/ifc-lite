/**
 * The one active scene-action application and what it captured before it
 * changed anything — the restore point behind "Restore previous view".
 *
 * Each channel carries the ownership fact its restore is gated on, chosen to
 * match how that channel is already arbitrated elsewhere in the viewer:
 *
 *  - selection: `selectionRevision` after apply (monotonic; any later
 *    selection write bumps it), as the chart slice gates its claim;
 *  - isolate: the installed isolation set, tested BY VALUE through
 *    `lib/visibility/ownership.ts` like clash, IDS, lists and charts. The
 *    record lives here rather than in the viewer store, so the store's
 *    invalidation middleware cannot see it; the subscription below drops it
 *    the first time the channel stops showing exactly what was installed —
 *    the same "a stale value record is dangerous" rule (#2654) the middleware
 *    enforces for the store-held records;
 *  - hide: the ids this application added (ids the user had already hidden
 *    are never recorded, so restore cannot reveal them);
 *  - colour: `colorPresentationRevision` after the paint, the IDS colour
 *    claim's test (`lib/ids/color-ownership.ts`);
 *  - section: the `sectionPlane` object installed (every section write
 *    replaces it) plus the section visibility toggle;
 *  - camera: the prior viewpoint. The camera is navigation, not a shared
 *    channel, so Restore always returns to it when asked.
