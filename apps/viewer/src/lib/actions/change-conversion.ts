/**
 * The common result of turning an existing editing workflow (a CSV table, a
 * bulk action, an IDS correction) into reviewed `model.changes` batches (P15).
 * Converters only read; every row that cannot become a checked change is
 * reported as an issue instead of being guessed.
 *
 * Batch size: one batch holds at most MODEL_CHANGE_LIMIT changes, so a larger
 * set is split into numbered parts, each reviewed and applied (and undone) on
 * its own. Parts never share a value, so applying one cannot make another
 * conflict. Above MODEL_CHANGE_PART_LIMIT parts the set is refused with
 * guidance to narrow it, rather than producing an unreviewable stack.
