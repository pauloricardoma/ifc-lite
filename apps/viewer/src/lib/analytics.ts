// `before_send` gate: drop the noise from an auto-recovered version skew - the
// tab reloads onto fresh assets, so the captured exception describes a failure
// the user never actually hits. Two sibling gates, because the two skews are
// detected differently: the wasm one by the error's own signature
// (shouldSuppressWasmSkewNoise), the JS/CSS chunk one by the reload we have
// already committed to (shouldSuppressChunkSkewNoise) - a failed chunk's
// collateral shares no vocabulary with its cause. A third gate drops what was
// never ours at all: a throw whose every frame belongs to an injected
// extension / user script (shouldSuppressForeignScriptNoise). Then run the privacy/tagging
// scrub on everything that remains. Kept here rather than inside scrubEvent so
// analytics-scrub.ts stays dependency-free (no @ifc-lite/geometry import) and
// independently unit-testable.
// Exported for ./analytics.test.ts and ./foreign-script-noise.test.ts. Only a
// test of THIS function can catch a gate being disconnected from the pipeline,
// which is the failure that would silently restore the noise.
//
// The three gates are NOT tested the same way, and the difference is
// deliberate. The two skew gates have isolated unit tests of their own
// (./wasm-skew-noise.test.ts, ./chunk-version-skew.test.ts) plus wiring tests
// here. The foreign-script gate is observed ONLY through this function, and
// adding an isolated test that imports ./foreign-script-noise.js directly would
// break something: `scripts/check-test-revert-oracle.mjs` reverts the
// production change and requires the changed tests to fail BY ASSERTION, and
// the #4939 fix ADDS that module - so a test importing it dies with
// ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND under the revert, no assertion runs, and the oracle
// reports REVERT-BROKE-BUILD. This file is modified rather than added, so under
// the revert it still loads with the gate absent and the assertions fail
// properly. Please do not "fix" that test by importing the module.

// PostHog's own `DOMExceptionCoercer` (posthog-js -> @posthog/core) does
// exactly this before an exception ever leaves the browser:
//
//   const hasStack = isString(err.stack);
//   return { ..., stack: hasStack ? err.stack : undefined, ... };
//
// — verified by reading @posthog/core's dom-exception-coercer.js. So any
// DOMException reaching `captureException` with no `.stack` is symbolicated
// as zero frames, full stop; no amount of sourcemap upload changes that,
// because there is nothing for PostHog to resolve.
//
// And a JS-constructed `DOMException` commonly HAS no `.stack`: confirmed by
// probing real engines with Playwright (both WebKit 26.5 and Chromium) —
// `new DOMException(msg, name)` is `instanceof Error` but `'stack' in err` is
// false in both. Contrast a DOMException the browser itself throws as part of
// a native binding failure (e.g. `structuredClone`'s `DataCloneError`), which
// DOES get a stack in both engines. Which path `GPUDevice.createTexture`'s
// `InvalidStateError` takes isn't independently verifiable without a live
// WebGPU device, but the fix below is correct either way: it only touches
// errors that already have no usable stack, so it can only add frames PostHog
// would otherwise have dropped, never disturb a real one.
//
// This is the root cause behind issues #2229/#2230 ("payload carries no
// stacktrace") for any call site whose caught value is a DOMException (GPU
// upload failures, WebGL context loss, AbortError-shaped cancellations, …).
//
// The fix: at the capture boundary, if the value handed to `captureException`
// is an `Error` (DOMException included — it's `instanceof Error`) with no
// usable `.stack`, synthesize one by throwing/catching fresh right here. That
// can't recover the original throw site, but every call site that reaches
// this (gpu-upload-guard.ts, useIfcLoader.ts, LocationMap.tsx, …) reports
// synchronously from inside its own catch block, so the synthesized frames
// are the same call chain minus the innermost native frame — real,
// sourcemap-resolvable file/line/column instead of the zero frames PostHog's
// coercer would otherwise emit. See ./analytics.test.ts for the RED/GREEN
// pair pinning this against posthog-js's actual coercer behavior.
