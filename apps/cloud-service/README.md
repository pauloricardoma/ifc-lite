# Hosted cloud gateway

Linux Node 24 backend for Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive. Users authenticate on
vendor pages. OAuth secrets and access/refresh tokens stay in process memory;
the browser receives an opaque HttpOnly cookie, identity and a CSRF token.
Autodesk and its Windows SDK worker remain separate services.

Run `pnpm typecheck` and
`pnpm test --filter=@ifc-lite/cloud-service` from the repository root through Turbo.
Build with `pnpm build --filter=@ifc-lite/cloud-service`; start with
`node apps/cloud-service/dist/bin.js` after workspace dependencies are built.

Configuration and deployment: [Railway runbook](../../deploy/cloud/railway.md).

The gateway is read-only and permits existing Dropbox RPCs and the signed-in
user's own OneDrive endpoints. It does not discover SharePoint sites or provide
historical Microsoft downloads. Graph metadata removes preauthenticated download
links; file transfers check current cTag/eTag before and after download.

Session lifetime is eight hours, with a 30-minute idle timeout. Restart signs
users out. Dropbox uses short-lived interactive authorization without refresh
tokens. Microsoft uses confidential Web authorization with PKCE, delegated
`User.Read Files.Read offline_access`, serialized refresh and local disconnect.
Disconnect removes the gateway's access; revoking app consent is performed in
the vendor account settings.

API JSON is bounded to 8 MiB; request JSON to 64 KiB. File transfers are capped
at 512 MiB and two concurrent downloads, with 15-minute cancellation deadlines.
Preparation returns a session-owned job immediately. Short status polls keep
slow upstream downloads below the edge proxy response deadline. Files spool to
private ephemeral directories before streaming and can be claimed once. Ready
artifacts expire after two minutes; cancellation, signout and shutdown remove
them. Capacity remains occupied until cancelled upstream work settles. Reserve at least
1.5 GiB temporary disk; no model artifact is intentionally retained after a
transfer. Startup removes owned crash leftovers from its dedicated private
runtime directory before serving requests. Shutdown aborts transfers and awaits
owned cleanup for up to five seconds, with a six-second process deadline. Use
one process per runtime directory and ephemeral container storage. Never mount
the temporary directory as a shared artifact volume.

Offline invariant tests do not establish live vendor qualification. Production
acceptance requires actual user sign-in, listing and loading an IFC file, expiry,
disconnect and permission-denial checks for each registered application.
