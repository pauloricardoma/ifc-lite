//! Cached-replay fast path for the SSE Parquet streaming endpoint: when a
//! request's geometry + metadata are already cached, replay them without
//! re-parsing, in the same Start / (Batch + Progress)* / Complete shape a
//! live parse streams (issue #3895). The geometry is split back into its
//! original stream batches via `parquet_replay_batches::split_into_batches`
//! (recovered from the cached blob's Parquet row-group boundaries); a blob
//! with no recoverable boundary falls back to one oversized batch, same as
//! before.
//!
//! `progress` numbers come from the `stream_progress` sidecar the live parse
//! wrote, so a hit reports the same JOB counts a miss does (issue #3897).
//! Entries cached before that sidecar existed have no job counts to replay;
//! those fall back to counting emitted MESHES, which is the wrong unit but
//! still monotonic and still ends at its own stated total.

/// Serve `POST /api/v1/parse/parquet-stream` from a client-supplied file hash,
/// with no request body at all (issue #3901).
///
/// The upload used to be unavoidable on a hit: the cache key is the SHA-256 of
/// the RECEIVED bytes, so `extract_file` had to finish before the cache could
/// be consulted, and on a 40 MB model over a real connection that upload was
/// the whole cost of the hit. A client that hashes locally can name the entry
/// instead.
///
/// The hash SELECTS; it never asserts. Everything the replay needs has to be on
/// disk under that key already, which is exactly what [`try_cached_replay`]
/// checks (geometry body, metadata header, a data model at the current payload
/// version, plus whatever it later adds). Delegating to it rather than
/// re-listing those entries here is what makes "a hash-only hit replays the
/// same events as an upload hit" true by construction instead of by two lists
/// agreeing. A miss answers `404`, the status
/// `GET /api/v1/cache/check/{hash}` already uses for "upload it", and the
/// client uploads.
///
/// A MISS costs no admission slot. The probe answers it from two small reads
/// (the metadata header and the data-model marker) before touching the gate,
/// because the common miss is a file the server has never seen and charging a
/// parse slot for a disk lookup would mean every cold-cache client wins
/// admission twice, probe then upload, and could be shed on the probe rather
/// than queueing for the upload that would have succeeded.
///
/// A HIT does take one, around the replay BUILD, dropped before the response is
/// returned. That is what the body-carrying hit path does, and for the same
/// reason: `try_cached_replay` reads the whole geometry blob into memory,
/// base64-encodes every batch, and materializes the full event vector before a
/// byte is sent, which is several times the model's geometry resident at once.
/// Leaving that window unbounded would make the cheapest request a client can
/// send the cheapest way to exhaust the server. Draining the finished stream
/// needs no slot.
