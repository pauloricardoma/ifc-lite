//! `POST /api/v1/parse/parquet-stream?sha256=...` with NO request body
//! (issue #3901).
//!
//! Before this, a cache hit on the streaming route still paid the full upload:
//! the key is the SHA-256 of the received bytes, so `extract_file` had to run
//! before the cache could be consulted. These tests pin the three properties
//! that make presenting a hash instead safe:
//!
//! 1. A hash-only HIT replays byte-for-byte the same SSE events an upload hit
//!    replays. If it did not, the parameter would be a second, divergent
//!    transport for the same data.
//! 2. A hash-only MISS answers `404` and runs no parse. A probe must not be a
//!    way to make the server do work, and the client has to be told to upload.
//! 3. A hash sent ALONGSIDE a body is ignored. The client's claim about its
//!    bytes never decides which entry is read or written.
