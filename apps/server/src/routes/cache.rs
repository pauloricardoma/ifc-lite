//! Cache retrieval and deletion endpoints.
//!
//! `GET` and `DELETE /api/v1/cache/{key}` take ONE key space: the request
//! `cache_key` a parse route returns (`result.cache_key` on `POST /parse`,
//! the `cache_key` in every Parquet response's `X-IFC-Metadata` header). Both
//! resolve it through [`resolve_request_cache_key`], so a key one of them
//! accepts the other accepts too, and a key one of them refuses the other
//! refuses with the same `400` (#5750).
