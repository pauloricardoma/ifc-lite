//! The geometry Parquet WIRE SCHEMA — the three tables the standard transport
//! emits, in one place.
//!
//! Split out of `parquet.rs` so the contract each client decodes against is
//! readable on its own (and so the serializer stays under its module-size
//! budget). Any column added or removed here is a wire-format change: keep it
//! additive and backward-compatible, and pin it with a test in
//! `parquet_tests.rs` — silently dropping a column is exactly how the per-mesh
//! `origin` went missing in issue #1841.

/// Two consequences for a decoder, both load-bearing:
/// - `origin_x/y/z` was zero on every row of a v5 flat blob from a DEFAULT
///   native server (the placement was baked into the vertices), so a decoder
///   that ignored it was accidentally correct. Only on a default one:
///   `local_frame_enabled` in `rust/geometry/src/router/transforms/mod.rs` is
///   opt-in on native via `IFC_LITE_LOCAL_FRAME`, and a deployment that sets
///   it has emitted non-zero origins here since #1841. On v6 the column
///   carries real values wherever a shape is shared, on every deployment, so
///   reading it is MANDATORY rather than merely recommended.
/// - `rot0..rot8` are absent on a v5 blob. Absent means identity, which is
///   exactly v5's behaviour; a v6 writer always emits them, identity included.
///
/// `include_rotation` follows the LAYOUT the client asked for
/// (`ParquetLayout`), not whether anything was actually shared: a v5 request
/// must come back byte-identical to what this route emitted before #3888, and
/// a v6 request must carry the columns even from a batch-local stream, which
/// shares nothing. That is why this is a parameter rather than being derived
/// from the payload, unlike `instance_schema`, whose transport HAS a version
/// byte to disambiguate an absent block from a truncated one.
