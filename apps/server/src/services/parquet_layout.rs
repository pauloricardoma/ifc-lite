//! The flat-Parquet mesh-table layout a request asked for.
//!
//! Its own module because it is the WIRE CONTRACT, not an implementation
//! detail of the writer: the route reads it off the query, the cache key is
//! built from it, the schema is chosen by it, and the client sends it. One
//! definition keeps those four in step.

/// Which flat-Parquet mesh-table layout a request asked for.
///
/// OPT-IN, defaulting to [`Self::Flat`], and that default is the whole point.
/// The flat wire carries no version byte (unlike `/optimized`), so a client
/// that predates the shared layout cannot fail loud on one — it decodes a
/// shared blob without error and draws every occurrence of a shared shape at
/// the template's placement. A server cannot tell those clients apart, so it
/// must not produce the new layout unless the client says it understands it.
/// Serving a smaller payload is not worth silently drawing the wrong building.

/// that sends `parquet_layout=shared-shapes` today decodes every batch on its
/// own, against that batch's own vertex table; a mesh row pointing into an
/// EARLIER batch's vertices would read as out of range at best, or as a
/// different shape's vertices at worst. So the stream shares across batches
/// only for a client that says it keeps earlier batches' shapes, and every
/// batch it sends that way states its `vertex_base` / `index_base` in the
/// event, which is how the client knows the server honoured the request.
///
/// Not part of the cache identity: a cross-batch stream fills the SAME v7
/// entry a batch-local one does, because both are valid whole-model v7 blobs
/// (whole-stream offsets, one row group per batch). What differs is how a
