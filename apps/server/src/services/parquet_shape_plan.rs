//! The SHAPE PLAN: which mesh row of the flat transport draws which block of
//! vertex/index rows.
//!
//! Split out of `parquet_mesh_tables.rs`, which packs the columns a plan
//! describes. One planner serves both routes that share shapes. The buffered
//! `POST /parse/parquet` plans a whole model against nothing (#3888, #5130).
//! The streaming route plans one batch at a time against the shapes EARLIER
//! batches already emitted (#5407), which is the only difference: the prior
//! registry is an argument, never a second implementation of the grouping.
