//! Streaming geometry processing with Server-Sent Events.
//!
//! Thin bridge over the canonical `ifc_lite_processing` pipeline: the
//! blocking task runs `process_geometry_streaming_filtered_with_baked_basis`
//! (`..._with_options` plus the frame published before the first batch,
//! #5407; the same code path as `POST /api/v1/parse` and the wasm
//! `processGeometryBatch` boundary) and forwards its batch callbacks through
//! a bounded channel as [`StreamEvent`]s (see [`EVENT_BUFFER_EVENTS`]).
//!
//! This file used to host a third, bespoke geometry pipeline with its own
//! scan, style index (SurfaceColour-only, no material chain, no indexed
//! colour maps), no aggregate void propagation, no submeshes and no type
//! geometry — meshes streamed from `/parse/stream` could differ from every
//! other surface (alignment audit). Supersede means delete: it is gone, and
//! the streaming endpoints inherit every pipeline feature (and bug fix)
//! automatically, including `opening_filter` support which the bespoke
//! pipeline never had.

/// How many events the blocking producer may run ahead of the response
/// stream before it waits for the client.
///
/// The channel between the two is the only place the parse's emit rate meets
/// the client's read rate. A client that stops reading keeps its connection
/// until the write-idle timeout closes it (`IFC_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`,
/// see `write_timeout.rs`); until then only this bound stops the producer
/// from queuing every batch of the model on top of the parse's working set,
/// which admission does not account for (it charges the UPLOAD size, not the
/// tessellated output). A full queue parks the producer in `blocking_send`
/// (legal there, it runs on a `spawn_blocking` thread), so a stalled reader
/// stalls its own parse instead of growing the process.
///
/// Four events is two batches: the pipeline emits each batch as a `Batch`
/// frame followed by its `Progress` frame, so the consumer always has one
/// batch to serialise and one queued behind it while the producer meshes the
/// next. Nothing is dropped: the producer waits for capacity. A receiver that
/// goes away makes a parked send return at once, and the next callback sees
/// `tx.is_closed()` and cancels.
