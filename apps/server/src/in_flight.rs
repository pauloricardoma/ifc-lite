//! In-memory marker for "a data-model write is running right now for this
//! cache key" (issue #5129).
//!
//! The key is the data-model ENTRY key (`data_model_cache_key`), not the
//! request key it is built from (#6034): the full and the rooted-only tables
//! are separate entries, and a fill of one says nothing about the other.
//!
//! `get_data_model` needs to tell a client "not yet, keep polling" apart from
//! "not for this key, stop asking": the first is 202, the second 404. A cache
//! miss alone cannot make that distinction — the entry could be absent because
//! nothing ever asked for it, which is exactly the case the issue's 404 is
//! for. This map is the missing signal: a key is present in it for the
//! lifetime of every background task that could still write it
//! (`parse_parquet_stream`'s data-model fill), and gone only once every such
//! task for that key has ended, however each one ends.
//!
//! Refcounted, not a plain set (PR #5134 review): two concurrent uploads of
//! the same content each spawn their own fill and each call `begin` with the
//! same cache key. A plain set's `remove` on either `Drop` would clear the
//! key while the other fill is still running, and a `GET` racing that window
//! would see 404 for a fill that is, in fact, still in progress.
