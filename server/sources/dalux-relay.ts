/**
 * Same-origin relay for the Dalux Build API.
 *
 * Dalux sends no CORS headers, so a browser cannot call it directly and the
 * app must forward through its own origin. The naive way to do that is a
 * blanket `vercel.json` rewrite, which is what this replaces: a rewrite turns
 * the deployment into an unauthenticated, method-agnostic proxy into an
 * authenticated per-tenant API. Anyone who learns the URL can drive Dalux
 * through our egress IPs, so Dalux's abuse controls would throttle *us*, and
 * every byte is billed to us.
 *
 * This handler keeps the CORS fix and drops the proxy:
 *
 *   - GET/HEAD only, so no writes can be relayed.
 *   - A caller-supplied `X-API-KEY` is mandatory. The relay holds no
 *     credential of its own, so it can never be used to read data anonymously.
 *   - The upstream path must match one of the API versions the provider
 *     actually calls, so the relay cannot reach admin or write endpoints even
 *     with a valid key.
 *   - Only an explicit header allowlist is forwarded, in both directions.
 *     Cookies never cross in either direction: the relay is same-origin, so
 *     without this the browser's own first-party cookies would be handed to a
 *     third party.
 *
 * Residual risk, deliberately documented rather than papered over: a caller
 * with their own valid Dalux key can still use this to reach Dalux from our
 * IPs, and key-guessing traffic is still anonymised. Neither is fixable in a
 * stateless handler. Put a Vercel WAF rate-limit rule on `/api/dalux` — see
 * the README section this file is referenced from.

 * Query parameter naming which Dalux node to reach (#2792).
 *
 * Dalux assigns each customer a node and shows it on the same page as the API
 * key, so a user on node2+ could not use Dalux Box at all: the client's URL no
 * longer matched the declared relay upstream, so it was never rewritten to the
 * same-origin relay, and Dalux sends no CORS headers.
 *
 * The client sends the node NAME, never a URL, and the origin is assembled
 * here from {@link DALUX_NODE_PATTERN}.
 *
 * The origin stays ours to build for the reason in this file's header: the
 * endpoint is unauthenticated, publicly reachable and holds no credential of
 * its own, so whatever host it can be aimed at is reachable by ANY anonymous
 * client through our egress IPs. Assembling the origin from a node name bounds
 * that to Dalux; a caller-supplied base URL would widen it to arbitrary
 * outbound requests from our infrastructure, including hosts not reachable
 * from the internet at all, and third-party traffic attributed to and billed
 * to us. The residual risk documented above is this one, already scoped to a
 * single host.
